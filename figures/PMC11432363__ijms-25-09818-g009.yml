figure_title: The changes in expression level of DEGs in four comparison groups for
  differential expression analyses involved in plant hormone signal transduction (A),
  MAPK signaling pathway (B), and three cultivar-specific pathways, including starch
  and source metabolism, phenylpropanoid metabolism, and ribosome pathways (C).
caption: 'The changes in expression level of DEGs in four comparison groups for differential
  expression analyses involved in plant hormone signal transduction (A), MAPK signaling
  pathway (B), and three cultivar-specific pathways, including starch and source metabolism,
  phenylpropanoid metabolism, and ribosome pathways (C). The color scale indicates
  the values of log2(FoldChange). RNAseq library abbreviations: XLC: leaves of X9
  cultivar under normal condition; XLS: leaves of X9 cultivar under salt stress; XRC:
  roots of X9 cultivar under normal condition; XRS: roots of X9 cultivar under salt
  stress; ZLC: leaves of Z9 cultivar under normal condition; ZLS: leaves of Z9 cultivar
  under salt stress; ZRC: roots of Z9 cultivar under normal condition; ZRS: roots
  of Z9 cultivar under salt stress'
