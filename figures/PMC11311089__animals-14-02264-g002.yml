caption: 'Pathway analysis of differential metabolites for prediction and early diagnosis
  of bovine mastitis. (a) Mastitis/healthy control metabolomics pathway analysis with
  milk samples, (b) mastitis/healthy control metabolomics pathway analysis with blood
  samples. Data were sourced from Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Note: The sizes
  and colors of the circles represent the corresponding metabolites ratio and the
  log (p-value) of each pathway, respectively'
