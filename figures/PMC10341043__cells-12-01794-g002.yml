  in obesity.
caption: Larval inflammation/immune pathways are upregulated in anxiety and downregulated
  in obesity. (A) PANTHER Overrepresentation Test identified “CCKR—gastrin- and cholecystokinin-mediated
  regulation of cellular processes signaling map”, “inflammation mediated by chemokine
  and cytokine signaling pathway”, and “interleukin signaling pathway”. Reference
  genes were all those included in the Danio rerio database, Fisher’s exact test,
  correction by FDR < 0.05. (B) Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
  reaction (qRT-PCR) results of the anxiety and obesity models are presented as graphs,
  with RNA-seq results below each graph, n= 6–8 replicates (10–30 larvae/replicate),
  2–3 separate experiments, Student’s t-test. Reference genes are the average of eef1a1l1
  and actb2. *—p < 0.05, **—p < 0.01, ***—p < 0.001
