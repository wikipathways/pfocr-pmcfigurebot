caption: 'Induction of metabolic pathway alterations by beta-hydroxybutyrate. This
  figure outlines the changes in the expression levels of proteins related to energy
  metabolism under various treatment conditions. (A) A series of treatments, labeled
  1 to 12, were administered to colorectal cancer organoids, incorporating components
  such as 10 mM BOHB, 200 ÂµM melatonin, and IC10-IC50 oxaliplatin: 1. melatonin +
  IC10 oxaliplatin, 2. melatonin + IC50 oxaliplatin, 3. melatonin, 4. BOHB, 5. melatonin
  + BOHB, 6. melatonin + BOHB + IC50 oxaliplatin, 7. melatonin + BOHB + IC10 oxaliplatin,
  8. BOHB + IC50 oxaliplatin, 9. BOHB + IC10 oxaliplatin, 10. IC10 oxaliplatin, 11.
  IC50 oxaliplatin, 12. control. Post 96 h treatment application to colorectal cancer
  organoids within a 48-well plate setup, cell lysates were subsequently harvested.
  The uncropped blots are shown in the Supplementary Figures S2 and S3. (B) The bar
  graph elucidates the expression levels of LDHA, MPC2, PDH, and PDK4 proteins under
  treatments 3, 4, and 5. (C) The bar graph exhibits the expression profiles of LDHA,
  MPC2, PDH, and PDK4 proteins under treatments 7, 9, and 10 (pertaining to IC10 oxaliplatin-inclusive
  treatments). (D) The bar graph portrays the expression levels of LDHA, MPC2, PDH,
  and PDK4 proteins under treatments 6, 8, and 11 (associated with IC50 oxaliplatin-inclusive
  treatments). Protein levels were quantified using ImageJ software version 1.41,
  with normalization performed against tubulin levels. All experiments were carried
  out with three biological and five technical replicates. Asterisks symbolize the
  statistical significance of the treatments (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 relative to
  the control)'
