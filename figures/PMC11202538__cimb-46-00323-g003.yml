figure_title: Targeting the Shh signalling pathway regulators.
caption: Targeting the Shh signalling pathway regulators. Inhibition of a signalling
  pathway requires identification of the pathwayâ€™s key regulators. Some strategies
  involve targeting SHH ligand, the most upstream regulator of Shh signalling, which
  have some positive results but are not yet clinically approved. The majority of
  targeting strategies are aimed at SMO, as it is the first oncogenic protein in the
  signalling process, showing the most success in inhibiting Shh signalling with many
  successful clinical trials and some FDA-approved compounds. Other strategies target
  GLI1/2, the key transcription factor in Shh signalling, showing some success in
  inhibition and moving into phase 2 of clinical trials. Newer studies are looking
  at inhibiting CD133, a surface protein that enhances Shh signalling, with microRNAs,
  although direct inhibition has not yet been achieved. The red X indicates Proliferation
  and stem-cell self-renewal are being inhibited
