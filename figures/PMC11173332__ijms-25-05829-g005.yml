figure_title: KEGG signaling pathway of significant up- and downregulated DEGs.
caption: KEGG signaling pathway of significant up- and downregulated DEGs. (A) Significant
  KEGG pathways shown in a bar plot according to the adjusted p < 0.05. The number
  in each bar represents the number of genes involved in each pathway. (B) Pie chart
  representing the percentage of each pathway. (C) The KEGG pathway network shows
  the name of genes involved in each pathway. The size of circles in each pathway
  represents the number of genes involved in each pathway. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001
