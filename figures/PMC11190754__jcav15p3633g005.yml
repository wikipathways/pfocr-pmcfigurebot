caption: Analysis of intercellular communication networks among various cell types
  using CellChat. Spatial transcriptomics is employed to deduce distinct intercellular
  communications within various signaling pathway networks. Network centrality scores
  for the CXCL (A), TGFb (B), VEGF (C), IL6 (D) signaling pathway are determined for
  each cell type. Heatmaps illustrate the signaling effects of cell populations and
  display network centrality scores for different signals
