caption: Heat map of metabolites involved in (A) the Calvin–Benson cycle and (B) the
  glycolysis pathway in leaves of Scotia tomato seedlings treated with pyroligneous
  acid (PA) under aluminum (Al) stress. Metabolite concentrations in each compartment
  are normalized across all data for an individual compound such that similar colour
  intensities between compounds can represent widely differing concentrations. The
  red colour represents a lower concentration, and the green colour represents a higher
  concentration of a particular metabolite
