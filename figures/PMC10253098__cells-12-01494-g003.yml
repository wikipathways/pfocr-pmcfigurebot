figure_title: Western blot analysis of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway.
caption: Western blot analysis of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway. SCs were
  treated with 10 μM ICH3 (a) PI3K expression. β-Actin was used as internal reference
  protein. The graph shows the densitometric analysis of the bands of Western blot
  analysis for PI3K normalized with the bands of the reference protein β-Actin. (b)
  Phospho-AKT (Thr308) expression. β-Actin was used as internal reference protein.
  The graph shows the densitometric analysis of the bands of Western blot analysis
  for Phospho-AKT normalized with the bands of the AKT (pan) protein. (c) Phospho-AKT
  (Ser473) expression. β-Actin was used as internal reference protein. The graph shows
  the densitometric analysis of the bands of Western blot analysis for Phospho-AKT
  normalized with the bands of the AKT (pan) protein. (d) Phospho-p70S6K (Thr 389)
  expression. β-Actin was used as internal reference protein. The graph shows the
  densitometric analysis of the bands of Western blot analysis for Phospho-p70S6K
  normalized with the bands of the non-phosphorylated p70S6K protein. (e) Phospho-AMPKα
  (Thr172) expression. β-Actin was used as internal reference protein. The graph shows
  the densitometric analysis of the bands of Western blot analysis for Phospho-AMPKα
  normalized with the bands of the non-phosphorylated AMPKα protein. All data are
  the average ± SEM of three independent experiments. Student’s t-test was used (*
  p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01)
