figure_title: Potential exosomal diagnostic biomarkers in mood disorders.
caption: 'Potential exosomal diagnostic biomarkers in mood disorders. Proteins and
  miRNAs associated with neuroactivity, as well as miRNAs associated with PI3K/AKT,
  fatty acid metabolism, cell adhesion, and the Wnt signaling pathway, have been detected
  in patients with depression. Note: Light green boxes represent exosomal biomarkers;
  red font represents increased expression; green font represents decreased expression.
  miR: microRNA/miRNA; SERPINF1: serpin family F member 1; PI3K: phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinase; AKT: serine/threonine kinase; GSK-3: glycogen synthase kinase-3'
