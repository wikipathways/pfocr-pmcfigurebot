caption: 'Schematic representation of the components of growth and neurotrophic factors
  signaling pathway.Most of them exert their trophic effects through tyrosine kinases
  receptors classical activation. The FGFR (βFGF), PDGFR (PDGF), TRKA (NGF), TRKB
  (BDNF), and EGFR (EGF) dimerization triggers many intracellular signaling pathways,
  including the Ras-MAPK, the PI3K, AKT/mTOR, and PLCγ-dependent pathway. However,
  GFRα1 and CNTFRα1, which bind to GDNF and CNTF respectively, need to form a complex
  multisub unit receptors system to signal. GDNF can be signaled by GDNF-GFRα1-RET
  signaling complex (canonical way), or by GDNF-GFRα1-NCAM complex (alternative pathway)
  and activate AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathway. CNTF can signal by a heterotrimeric receptor
  (CNTFRα-gp130-LIFRβ) activating JAK/STATs pathway and other signaling ways. TRKs
  activation by these factors can promote neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity,
  neurite outgrowth, axon growth, protein synthesis, and cell proliferation. AKT:
  Ak strain transforming; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CNTF: ciliary neurotrophic
  factor; CNTFRα1: ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor α1; EGF: epidermal growth
  factor; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; FGFR: fibroblast growth factor receptor;
  GDNF: glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; GFRα1: GDNF family receptor α1;
  Gp130: glycoprotein 130; JAK: janus kinase; LIFRβ: leukemia inhibitory factor receptor
  β; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin;
  NCAM: neural cell adhesion molecule; NGF: nerve growth factor; PDGF: platelet-derived
  growth factor; PDGFR: platelet-derived growth factor receptor; PI3K: phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; PLCγ: phospholipase C gamma; Ras: rat sarcoma virus; RET: rearranged during
  transfection; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; TRKA/B: tyrosine
  kinase receptor A/B; βFGF: fibroblast growth factor beta.'
