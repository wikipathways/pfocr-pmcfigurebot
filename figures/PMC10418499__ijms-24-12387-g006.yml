  tolerance.
caption: Potential important candidate genes and metabolites for rice saline–alkaline
  tolerance. (A) Expression patterns of important candidate genes. The data in the
  boxes indicate the log2 (fold change) of genes in Chao2R and RPY geng after exposure
  to saline–alkaline condition compared with untreated control (short for 0_vs_A).
  The upregulation and downregulation are masked in blue and red, respectively. (B)
  The expression heatmap showing the log2 (fold change) of important candidate metabolites
  in Chao2R and RPY geng after exposure to saline–alkaline condition in comparison
  with untreated control (short for 0_vs_A). Blue and red indicate downregulation
  and upregulation, respectively. (C) Co-expression network of candidate genes (Pearson
  correlation coefficient (PCC) ≥ 0.9, p < 0.01). (D) An interactive correlation network
  of potential important candidate genes and metabolites involved in rice salt–alkaline
  tolerance (PCC ≥ 0.9, p < 0.01). Red lines indicate the positive correlation, blue
  solid ellipses indicate metabolites, red solid ellipses indicate genes involved
  in plant signal transduction pathways, and green solid ellipses indicate genes related
  to non-signal transduction pathways
