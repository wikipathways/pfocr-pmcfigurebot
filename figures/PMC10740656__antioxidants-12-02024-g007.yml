figure_title: Stable overexpression of TSP-1 promotes fibroblast activation by CD47/ROS/ER
  stress signaling pathway.
caption: Stable overexpression of TSP-1 promotes fibroblast activation by CD47/ROS/ER
  stress signaling pathway. (A) GSEA analysis showed the positive correlation between
  THBS1 gene expression and UPR and ROS pathways. (B) Mlg cells were transfected with
  Lv-Control or lentivirus expressing TSP-1 (Lv-TSP-1) to establish a fibroblast cell
  line with stable TSP-1 overexpression. Expression of NOX family members (NOX1-5)
  and fibrotic markers (α-SMA and Collagen-1) in TSP-1-overexpressed Mlg cells was
  assessed by qPCR. (C–E) Mlg cells stably transfected with Lv-TSP-1 or Lv-Control
  were treated with vehicle or CD47 inhibitor RRx-001 (5 µM) for 48 h. (C) ROS production
  was examined by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining (red). Nuclei were stained with blue
  using 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Scale bars correspond to 50 μm. (D)
  The protein levels of Grp78 and CHOP were determined by Western blot analysis. Representative
  protein bands were presented on the top of the histograms. (E) The protein levels
  of α-SMA and fibronectin were determined by Western blot analysis. Representative
  protein bands are presented at the top of the histograms. Data are expressed as
  mean ± SEM (n = 7). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01
