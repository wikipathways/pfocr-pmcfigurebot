figure_title: Detoxification of ROS.
caption: Detoxification of ROS. Gene set enrichment analysis of the Reactome Detoxification
  of Reactive Oxygen Species pathway. The Detoxification of Reactive Oxygen Species
  gene set is enriched in the (A) Npc1−/−/App−/− cerebral cortex and (B) cerebellum
  when compared to its Npc1−/−/App+/+, Npc1+/+/App−/−, and Npc1+/+/App+/+, counterparts.
  ES = enrichment score; NES = normalized enrichment score; FDR-q = false discovery
  rate q-value. Significance is determined by an FDR-q < 0.25
