  in nitrogen deficiency.
caption: Differentially expressed (DE) genes and functional annotation involved in
  nitrogen deficiency. (A) Volcano plot of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs 4 h after nitrogen
  starvation. (B) Volcano plot of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs 48 h after nitrogen starvation.
  (C) Venn diagram of DE lncRNAs 4 h and 48 h after nitrogen starvation. (D) GO enrichment
  analysis of cis-regulated target genes. (E) GO enrichment analysis of trans-regulated
  target genes. Red represents high enrichment functional classification, and blue
  represents terms with relatively low enrichment. The numbers in each term label
  indicate the number of DE genes. (F) KEGG annotation of DE lncRNA-targeted genes
  4 h after nitrogen starvation. (G) KEGG annotation of DE lncRNA-targeted genes 48
  h after nitrogen starvation. The vertical axis represents the name of the KEGG metabolic
  pathway, and the horizontal axis represents the number of lncRNA-targeted genes
  annotated to this pathway and their proportion to the total number of lncRNA-targeted
  genes annotated
