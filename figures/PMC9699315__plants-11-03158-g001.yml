caption: 'Biochemistry of flavonoids with their various subgroups: Phosphoenolpyruvate
  and erythrose-4-phosphate are converted to chorismate via the shikimate pathway
  in seven metabolic stages. Chorismate is the common precursor of three aromatic
  amino acids viz., tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. The enzyme phenyl ammonium
  lyase (PAL) induces the synthesis of cinnamic acid from phenylalanine, and cinnamate
  is converted to p-Coumaric acid by the activity of cinnamate 4-hydroxylate. Another
  enzyme 4-coumaroyl CoA ligase converts p-Coumaric acid into 4-coumaroyl CoA and
  3-malonyl CoA, which are responsible for synthesizing chalcones by chalcone synthase
  activity. Eriodictyol chalcone and naringenin chalcone are the two classes of chalcones.
  The flavanones are synthesized from chalcones by the activity of chalcone isomerase.
  There are different subgroups of flavonoids, shown in this diagrammatic representation.
  Fisetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin are the types of flavonols. Hesperitin,
  naringin, and naringenin are the types of flavanones. Some types of isoflavonoids
  are daidzein, glycitein, and genistein. Flavanols are produced from flavanones by
  dihydroflavonol reductase activity, and some examples of flavanols are catechin,
  epicatechin, and epigallocatechin. The enzyme flavone synthase is responsible for
  the production of flavones from flavanones. Apigenin, chrysin, luteolin, and rutin
  are some types of flavones. The two other flavonoid subgroups—isoflavones and dihydroflavonols—are
  synthesized by the activity of isoflavonoid synthase and flavanone 3-hydroxylase,
  respectively. Dihydroflavonol reductase converts dihydroflavonols into leucoanthocyanidins,
  which are converted into anthocyanidins by the anthocyanidin synthase enzyme. Cyanidin,
  delphinidin, and pelargonidin are some types of anthocyanidins.'
