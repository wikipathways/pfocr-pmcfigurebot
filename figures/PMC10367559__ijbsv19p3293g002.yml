caption: ZIC2 promotes proliferation and affects the cell cycle of ccRCC cells. (A)
  GSEA between the low and high ZIC2 expression groups in the Hallmark and KEGG pathway.
  (B) RT-qPCR and Western blot experiment confirmed the success of ZIC2 knockdown.
  (C-E) When ZIC2 was knocked down, the proliferation and colony forming ability decreased
  significantly. (F) Cell cycle distribution when ZIC2 was knocked down. (G) Subcutaneous
  tumor formation ability was reduced in nude mice when ZIC2 was knocked down
