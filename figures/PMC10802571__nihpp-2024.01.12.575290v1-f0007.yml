figure_title: Transcriptomic changes in mice placed on dietary folate restriction
  late in life point to reduced protein synthesis in both sexes
caption: (A) Steady-state levels of mRNAs from liver tissue collected at 120 weeks
  of age were measured by RNAseq. Changes in the indicated pairwise comparisons were
  identified from the magnitude of the difference (x-axis; Log2-fold change) and statistical
  significance (y-axis; based on robust bootstrap ANOVA tests), as indicated by the
  red lines (see Materials and Methods). The number of transcripts whose levels changed
  within these thresholds is shown in each case. (B) Transcript enrichment analysis
  based on the PANTHER platform (Ashburner et al., 2000; Gene Ontology Consortium
  et al., 2023; Thomas et al., 2022) for male mice from the data in (A), for transcripts
  present at significantly lower levels under folate-limitation (p<0.05 and >1.5-fold
  change) that could be assigned to a specific gene ID (n=165). The corresponding
  biological processes are on the y-axis, and the p values are on the x-axis. The
  size of each bubble on the chart reflects the relative number of ‘hit’ transcripts
  in each process. The color of each bubble reflects the enrichment ratio, which is
  the number of hits within a process divided by the expected number of hits. Only
  pathways with enrichment >2 and FDR values <0.05 are shown. (C) Transcript enrichment
  analysis for female mice from the data in (A), for transcripts present at significantly
  lower levels under folate-limitation (p<0.05 and >1.5-fold change) that could be
  assigned to a specific gene ID (n=490). The plots were drawn as in (B)
