caption: Immune landscape in PAAD patients among three clusters. (A) Heatmap demonstrating
  the clinicopathologic features among three clusters. (B) The infiltration levels
  of 22 immune cells in the three clusters. (C,D) The ESTIMATE score (C) and Immunoscore
  (D) in clusters 1, 2, and 3. (E–G) The expression levels of immune activation (E),
  immune checkpoint related genes (F), and TGF-β/EMT signaling pathway-related genes
  (G) in the three clusters. (H,I) Differences in stromal score (H) and TIDE scores
  (I) in clusters 1, 2, and 3. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
