caption: HCV-induced ROS/JNK/Itch signaling pathway promotes VSP4A polyubiquitylation,
  leading to enhancement of VPS4A ATPase activity, thereby upregulating the release
  of HCV particles. HCV infection induces mitochondrial ROS production and JNK activation,
  which phosphorylates Itch, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, causing a conformational
  change and activation of Itch (step 1). Activated Itch promotes the polyubiquitylation
  of VPS4A (step 2), increasing its interaction with CHMP1B (step 3), which is involved
  in the promotion of VPS4A ATPase activity and formation of a VPS4A hexamer. Activated
  VPS4A dissociates ESCRT-III complex from endosomal membranes (step 4), resulting
  in membrane scission and formation of the MVB. Subsequently, ESCRT-MVB pathway-mediated
  HCV particle release is enhanced (step 5). P, phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitylation
