figure_title: Effect of FABP5-KO on the malignant characteristics of DU145 and on
  protein levels of the downstream proteins of the FABP5 pathway.
caption: Effect of FABP5-KO on the malignant characteristics of DU145 and on protein
  levels of the downstream proteins of the FABP5 pathway. (A) Microscopical appearances
  revealed morphological difference between DU145 and DU145-FABP5-KO cells. (B) Effect
  of FABP5-KO on the proliferation of DU145 cells. (C) Effect of FABP5-KO on DU145
  cell invasion was assessed by an invasion assay, and (D) the average number of invasive
  cells from DU145 and DU145-FABP5-KO cells were recorded. (E) Anchorage-independent
  growth of DU145 and DU145-FABP5-KO cells, and (F) their average colony numbers formed
  in soft agar. (G) Effect of FABP5-KO on migration was assessed at different times
  in a gap closure assay. (H) The quantitative assessment of the average size of wound
  space gap at different times. (I) Western blot analysis of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 proteins.
  (J) Relative levels of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 in DU145 and DU145-FABP5-KO cells. (K)
  Western blots were performed for pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2 in DU145 and DU145-FABP5-KO
  cells. (L) Relative levels of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2. Levels of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2
  in DU145 cells were each set at '1', and the levels in DU145-FABP5-KO cells were
  obtained by comparing with those in DU145. (M) Western blot analysis of VEGF protein
  in DU145 and DU145-FABP5-KO cells. (N) Relative levels of VEGF in DU145 and DU145-FABP5-KO
  cells; the level of VEGF in DU145 cells was set at '1', and the level in DU145-FABP5-KO
  cells was obtained by comparing with that in DU145. (O) Western blot analysis of
  ARFL and ARV7 proteins in DU145 and DU145-FABP5-KO cells. Since neither of the proteins
  were detectable in either cell line, no quantification was possible. The relative
  protein levels were reproduced independently three times, and the differences were
  assessed by Student's t-test. ***P<0.0001 and ****P<0.00001. KO, knockout; FABP5,
  fatty acid-binding protein 5; AR, androgen receptor; ARFL, full-length AR; ARV7,
  AR splicing variant 7; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; pPPARγ,
  phosphorylated PPARγ; VEGF, vascular endothelium growth factor; ns, not statistically
  significant
