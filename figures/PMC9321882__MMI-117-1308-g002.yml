caption: 'A cartoon illustrating early and late stages of the CoV life cycle. Upper
  panel: Following attachment to specific receptor(s)—such as ACE2—CoV enters cells
  either by fusing directly with the cell surface, or following its uptake into endosomes,
  where the viral envelope fuses with the endosomal membrane. In both cases, the viral
  nucleocapsid enters the cytoplasm and undergoes uncoating, resulting in the release
  of the viral RNA genome. The positive‐sense RNA associates with host cell ribosomes
  directing the synthesis of non‐structural proteins (nsps), which provide subunits
  of the viral RNA replicase or act in the biogenesis of an ER‐derived convoluted
  membrane compartment, which includes double‐membrane vesicles (DMVs)—the sites for
  viral RNA replication and transcription. Lower panel: Sub‐genomic mRNAs produced
  in the DMVs function in the synthesis of the viral structural proteins—the cytoplasmic
  nucleocapsid (N) protein and three membrane proteins (E, M, and S)—in free‐ or ER
  membrane‐bound ribosomes, respectively. Vesicle‐mediated transport and accumulation
  of the membrane proteins at the IC membranes sets, the stage for virus assembly
  by budding into the IC lumen. Three alternative pathways for CoV delivery from the
  IC to the extracellular space are depicted: Route 1) the progeny viruses highjack
  the constitutive secretory pathway as they segregate into the dilated rims of Golgi
  cisternae and pass across the Golgi stacks (cis‐to‐trans) based on cisternal progression.
  At trans‐Golgi, the viruses are sorted into post‐Golgi carriers which move to the
  PM and undergo exocytosis. Route 2) this pathway bypassing the Golgi stacks is based
  on a direct connection between the IC elements and REs, defined by Rab1 and Rab11,
  respectively. Prior to Golgi fragmentation, these compartments reside at the non‐compact
  zones of the Golgi ribbon, connecting the different Golgi stacks. In this case,
  the endocytic recycling system provides the carriers for the final delivery of the
  virus for exocytosis. Route 3) the progeny viruses are released from cells via lysosomal
  exocytosis. They may reach the lysosomes via trans‐Golgi; for example, following
  route 1, or employ a direct IC‐to‐lysosome pathway, which remains to be identified.
  for simplicity, only one CoV particle in the lumen of the carriers is shown, although
  many of them contain numerous viruses'
