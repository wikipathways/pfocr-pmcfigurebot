caption: The application of biosensors on plant natural products (PNPs) synthesis
  in microbial cell factories (MCFs). MCFs have been used to produce various valuable
  PNPs. Biosensors can be employed to improve production by activating the PNPs synthesis
  pathways and inhibiting the competition pathways. In addition, these biosensors
  can also be used for the screening of high-production strains
