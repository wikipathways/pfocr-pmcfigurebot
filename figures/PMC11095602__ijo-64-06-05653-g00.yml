caption: Main signalling pathway mechanisms of SASP in lymphoma cellular resistance.
  The loss of p53 and expression of NF-ÎºB exacerbate the paracrine activity of SASP,
  which promotes cytokine secretion, as well as signal transduction pathways, including
  mTOR/NOTCH/ERK/JAK-STAT, mediate the stem-like proliferation of lymphoma senescent
  cells. All of these facilitate the drug resistant characteristics of lymphoma cells.
  SASP, senescent-associated secretory phenotype
