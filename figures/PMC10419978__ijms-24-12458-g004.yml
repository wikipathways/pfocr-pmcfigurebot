caption: Pathway analysis based on different metabolism of IR and NIR groups. The
  pathway enrichment analysis is a quantitative analysis using the concentration values
  of the compounds compared to the list of the compounds used with over-representation
  analysis. Based on enrichment (y-axis) and topology analysis (x-axis), this figure
  illustrates pathways that are significantly changed. The higher impact values represent
  the relative importance of the pathway, and the size of the circles illustrates
  the impact of the pathway (the larger circle represents greater pathway enrichment).
  The color of the circles indicates the significance (the more intense the red color,
  the lower the p value is)
