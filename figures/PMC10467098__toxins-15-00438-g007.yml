  pathway proteins.
caption: |-
  Effects of different concentrations of SP on LPS-induced MAPK signaling pathway proteins. (A) WB protein bands of P-JNK, P-ERK, P-p38 MAPK, ERK, JNK, p38MAPK and β-actin in RECs treated with 10 μg/mL LPS and 15, 25, 35 mM SP; (B–D) the phosphorylation intensities of JNK, ERK and p38MAPK. ##
  p < 0.01, ** p < 0.01, # was LPS group vs. control group, * was SP (15, 25, 35 mM) group vs. LPS group. N = 5 in each group
