caption: TSS coverage can differentiate patients with and without EGFR mutations.
  (A) 26 pathways related to EGFR from the KEGG database were selected. For each of
  the 65 patients with EGFR mutation detection, the average normalized TSS coverage
  of genes involved in these 26 pathways was calculated. Boxplots of path scores based
  on the normalized TSS coverage mean in these 26 pathways were plotted for patients
  with and without EGFR mutations, with differences between groups indicated by p-values
  (*** represents p < 0.001, ** represents p < 0.01, * represents p < 0.05, ns represents
  not significant). (B) Out of the total 619 KEGG pathways analyzed, 146 (23.6%) demonstrated
  variances in path scores, with a striking 57.7% (15/26) of EGFR-related pathways
  showing significant intergroup differences (p < 0.01). (C) Among the non-EGFR mutation
  pathways, only 29 out of 143 (20.3%) displayed significant differences (p < 0.01).
  (D) The TSS coverage of all transcripts corresponding to genes in the 26 pathways
  was calculated, and the TSS with differential expression between groups was selected
  for heatmap analysis, demonstrating significant differences between patients with
  and without EGFR mutations. (E) An EGFR mutation status prediction model was built
  and showed good performance in both the training and validation cohorts
