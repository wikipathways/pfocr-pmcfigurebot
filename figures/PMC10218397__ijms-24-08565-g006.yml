  pathway.
caption: 'TASE and thymol exert neurite outgrowth activity via TrkB signaling pathway.
  Primary hippocampal neurons were maintained under same culture conditions, as indicated
  in Figure 4. For 3 days in presence of vehicle, ANA-12 (TrkB inhibitor, 5 μM), TASE
  (75 μg/mL) or TASE + ANA-12, thymol (10 μM) or thymol (10 μM) + ANA-12, and quercetin
  (5 μM) or quercetin (5 μM) + ANA-12 (a) Representative immunofluorescence images
  with α-tubulin (green) and ankyrin G (red) from each treatment. Arrowheads represent
  the axon hillock stained via ankyrin G (red). Scale bar, 100 μm, applies to all
  images. (b) Number of primary processes, (c) length of longest primary process,
  and (d) length of total primary processes. (e) Western blot image showing MAP2 protein
  expression. (f) Bar graphs showing relative quantification of western blot intensity.
  Bars represent mean ± SD (n = 30 neurons) and (n = 3) for western blot analysis.
  Statistical significance was compared to vehicle: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001, and ns: not significant, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
