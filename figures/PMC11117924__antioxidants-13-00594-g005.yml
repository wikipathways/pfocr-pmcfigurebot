caption: 'The IL-6 signaling pathway and the mechanism of action of tolicizumab. Through
  a receptor composed of signal transduction subunit glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and
  the auxiliary transmembrane protein IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), IL-6 activates the JAK/STAT
  axis, while the MAPK cascade and the PI3K/Akt axis are activated by the domain SHP2.
  Tolicizumab antagonizes the subunit gp130. Akt: Ak strain transforming (also known
  as protein kinase B, PKB); IL-6: interleukin-6; IL-6R: IL-6 receptor; gp130: glycoprotein
  130; JAK: Janus kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K: phosphoinositide
  3-kinases; SHP2: src homology phosphotvrosvlphosphatase 2; STAT: signal transducer
  and activator of transcription'
