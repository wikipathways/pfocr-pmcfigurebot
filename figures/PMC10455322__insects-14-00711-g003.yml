caption: The role of Ca+2 mobilization through ETH-mediated signaling is responsible
  for the JH biosynthesis through the activation of JHMAT in CA. ETH plays an important
  role in the JH biosynthesis and activation of JHAMT, a key enzyme in the JH biosynthetic
  pathway through mobilization of Ca+2 from the intra- and extracellular storages.
  ETH binds to ETHR (a 7TM, GPCR), located on the cell surface in the CA, and activates
  the G-protein associated with the ETHR by exchanging the bound GDP with a GTP. The
  α subunit of the G-protein, together with the bound GTP, then dissociates from the
  βγ subunits to activate membrane-bound phospholipase C (PLC). PLC then catalyzes
  the conversion of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG) from PIP3.
  IP3 binds to the IP3-R located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), an intracellular
  storage of Ca+2, and releases stored Ca+2 in the cytoplasm. Ca+2 is also mobilized
  into the cytoplasm through the store-operated Ca+2 entry channels (SOC) in response
  to ETH (ligand) binding to ETH receptors. An increase in cellular levels of Ca+2
  resulted in the activation of phosphokinase C, which in turn enhanced the JHAMT
  activity, ultimately leading to increased JH production and release. ETH = ecdysis
  triggering hormone; GPCR = G-protein coupled receptor; PIP3 = phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3 = inositol triphosphate; IP3R = inositol triphosphate receptor;
  PLC = phospholipase C; PKC = phosphokinase C; DAG = diacylglycerol; SOC = store-operated
  Ca2+ entry channel; ER = endoplasmic reticulum; and JH = juvenile hormone; * = Activation
