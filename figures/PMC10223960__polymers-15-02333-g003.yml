caption: 'The in vitro modular assembly of synthetic PHA. The different metabolic
  modules are assembled and coupled to synthesize PHA using different substrates.
  Cell-free PHA synthesis can be achieved in vitro by assembling various metabolic
  modules and then coupling the PHA synthesis pathway to achieve the utilization of
  different substrates. The process typically involves generating acetyl-CoA modules
  and then combining them with the acetyl-CoA utilization pathway to synthesize the
  precursors of PHA. The enzymes related to central metabolism exhibit high activity,
  leading to a high rate of acetyl-CoA production and ensuring a sufficient substrate
  supply for the subsequent PHA synthesis pathway. While the utilization of fatty
  acids can directly lead to the synthesis of mcl-PHA, non-fatty acid substrates usually
  need to be converted into acetyl-CoA before participating in the synthesis of PHA.
