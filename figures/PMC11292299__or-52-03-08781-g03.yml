figure_title: ABT-737 increases the sensitivity of A2780/DDP cells to cisplatin through
  the JNK pathway.
caption: 'ABT-737 increases the sensitivity of A2780/DDP cells to cisplatin through
  the JNK pathway. (A) A2780/DDP cells were treated with cisplatin (5 µg/ml) alone
  or combined with ABT-737 (10 µM) for 24 h. Western blot analysis of p-JNK, JNK,
  p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-p38, p38, p-AKT and AKT protein expression. (B-E) Quantitative
  analysis of (B) p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, (C) p-JNK/JNK, (D) p-p38/p38 and (E) p-AKT/AKT
  protein levels from panel A. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments. *P<0.05 vs. the control group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs.
  the cisplatin group. (F) A2780/DDP cells were treated with cisplatin (5 µg/ml) combined
  with ABT-737 (10 µM) or combined with ABT-737 (10 µM) and U0126 (5 µM), SB203580
  (5 µM), SP600125 (5 µM) or LY294002 (5 µM) for 24 h; then cell viability was detected
  by MTT assays. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  **P<0.01 vs. the control group; #P<0.05 vs. the cisplatin + ABT-737 group. (G) A2780/DDP
  cells were treated with cisplatin (5 µg/ml) combined with ABT-737 (10 µM) or combined
  with ABT-737 (10 µM) and U0126 (5 µM), SB203580 (5 µM), SP600125 (5 µM), or LY294002
  (5 µM) for 24 h; then cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. (H) Quantitative
  analysis of the flow cytometry results. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three
  independent experiments. **P<0.01 vs. the control group; ##P<0.01 vs. the cisplatin
  + ABT-737 group'
