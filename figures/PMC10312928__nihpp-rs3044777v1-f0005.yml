figure_title: Protein-protein interaction network and functional enrichment analysis
  of proteins with acetylation, carbamylation and phosphorylation sites regulated
  by bacterial lipopolysaccharide
caption: The network contains 54 common proteins which had altered levels of carbamylation,
  acetylation, and phosphorylation by the LPS treatment. The bar graph shows the direction
  of regulation (p < 0.05) of the three modifications after LPS treatment. The network
  was enriched in proteins of the innate immune system, cytokine signaling pathway
  in immune system, and protein post-translation modification pathway using Reactome
  and they are highlighted the color of pink, blue, green, respectively. The line
  colors represent if the interactions were experimental determined (pink) and curated
  in databases (purple)
