caption: A schematic model of the Trp-dependent IAA biosynthetic pathway (A) and the
  expression of DEGs involved in the pathways (B). Wheat seedlings were treated with
  5 mM NO3− (CK), 0.1 mM NO3− (LN), and 0.1 mM NO3− + 60 mg/L TIBA (LNT) for 48 h.
  AO, indole-3-acetaldehyde oxidase; DAO, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase; GH3,
  indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase; IAA-AA, indole-3-acetic acid–amino acid conjugate;
  IAAId, indole-3-acetaldehyde; IGP, indole-3-glycerophosphate; IGPS, indole-3-glycerol
  phosphate synthase; ILL, IAA-amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like; IPA, indole-3-pyruvate;
  TAM, tryptamine; TAR, tryptophan aminotransferase-related protein; TDC1, tryptophan
  decarboxylase 1; Trp, tryptophan; TSA, tryptophan synthase alpha chain; YUCs, indole-3-pyruvate
  monooxygenase. Heatmap (B) showing the differential expression levels of the identified
  DEGs in the roots of wheat plants with different N treatments. The log2(FoldChange)
  values for individual genes are indicated by the color, as shown in the scale, with
  red indicating a high level of expression and blue indicating a low level of expression
