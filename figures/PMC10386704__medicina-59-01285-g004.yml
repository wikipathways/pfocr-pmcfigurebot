caption: The association of riskScore with important pathways in the KEGG was assessed
  via a GSEA. The results of the GSEA revealed significant correlations between riskScore
  and several pathways, including the mismatch repair, JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway,
  VEGF signaling pathway, antigen processing presentation, ERBB signaling pathway,
  and P53 signaling pathway. The statistical significance of each association was
  calculated using log-rank tests
