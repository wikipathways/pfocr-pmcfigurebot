caption: ACSE inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages.
  J774 cells were pretreated with 50 µg/mL of ACSE and then stimulated with 1 µg/mL
  of LPS for the indicated hours. (A,B) The effects of ACSE on the phosphorylation
  of STAT1/STAT3 (A) and IKKα/β and IκBα (B). (C) The effect of ACSE on the nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB p65. PARP and β-actin were used as loading controls for the
  nuclear and cytosolic fractions, respectively
