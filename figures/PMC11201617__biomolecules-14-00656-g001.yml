caption: 'Signaling pathways activated by growth factors: the interaction of the growth
  factors with their specific receptors triggers the molecular cascade of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and RAS/RAF/MERK/ERK, which results in the transcription (arrow) of genes responsible

  angiogenesis. TGF-β—transforming growth factor-β; EGF—epidermal growth factor; IGF
  I/II—insulin-like growth factor I/II; VEGF—vascular endothelial growth factor; FGF—fibroblast
  growth factor; HGF—hepatocyte growth factor; EGFR—epidermal growth factor receptor;

  transition factor; SMAD—Sma gene and the Drosophila MAD (Mothers against decapentaplegic);
  PI3K—phosphoinositide 3-kinases; PIP2—phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3—phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate; AKT—serine/threonine-specific protein
  kinase (AKR mouse strain that develops spontaneous thymic lymphomas); mTOR—mammalian
  target of rapamycin; RAS—rat sarcoma virus; RAF—rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma;
  MEK—mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK—extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
  AP-1—activator protein-1; c-Jun—Jun proto-oncogene; c-FOS—a proto-oncogene that
