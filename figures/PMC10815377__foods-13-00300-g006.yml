figure_title: PaPSY may be regulated by transcription factors to influence β-carotene
  metabolism in apricots.
caption: 'PaPSY may be regulated by transcription factors to influence β-carotene
  metabolism in apricots. (A) Schematic diagram of cis-acting elements of the PaPSY
  promoter in ‘X15’ and ‘JTY’. (B) GUS staining for transient expression of the PaPSY
  promoter of ‘X15’ and ‘JTY’ in tobacco leaves. (C) Expression levels of possible
  transcription factors regulating PaPSY. (D) Coloration of ‘Pingguoxing’ injected
  with PaPSY silencing Agrobacterium plasmid mixture (TRV1 + TRV2: PaPSY). An empty
  TRV1 + TRV2 vector was used as a control. (E) Determination of carotenoid content
  in silencing experiments. (F) Relative expression levels of β-carotene synthesis
  pathway genes in silencing experiments. The different letters represent significant
  differences (LSD test, p < 0.05). The asterisks indicate significant differences
  (** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns: not significant) based on the Student’s t-test'
