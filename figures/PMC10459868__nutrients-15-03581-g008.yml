figure_title: Postnatal overfeeding alters AMPK activation in a sex and brain-region-specific
  manner.
caption: Postnatal overfeeding alters AMPK activation in a sex and brain-region-specific
  manner. Metabolic parameters of males (A) and females (B) under postnatal overfeeding
  conditions. In male hippocampus, no alterations were observed in proteins involved
  in insulin signalling pathway, namely total IR (C), IRp (D), total AMPK (E), and
  phosphorylated AMPK (F). In the prefrontal cortex, lower levels of total IR (G),
  total AMPK (I), and its phosphorylation form (J) were noted, without alterations
  in phosphorylated IR (H). In the female hippocampus, no alterations were observed
  in total IR (K) levels and its phosphorylated form (L), although lower total AMPK
  (M) levels were noted, accompanied by higher levels of its phosphorylation (N).
  In the female prefrontal cortex, no alterations were observed in total (O) and phosphorylated
  (P) IR levels; although lower total (Q) AMPK was noted, no changes were observed
  regarding AMPK activation (R). The results are shown as mean Â± SEM of 4 to 6 animals
  per group for Western blot analysis. For statistical analysis, unpaired t-test was
  conducted to compare the experimental groups. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p
