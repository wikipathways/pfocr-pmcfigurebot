figure_title: Exposure to herbal extracts of V.
caption: Exposure to herbal extracts of V. lobelianum and O. cornuta activates the
  DNA damage response pathway in C. elegans, resulting in increased levels of key
  DNA damage checkpoint components and phosphorylated CHK-1. (A) ATM and ATR kinases
  collaboratively regulate downstream CHK-1 processes in the intricate DNA damage
  response pathway, playing essential roles in DNA damage repair. (B) Exposure to
  herbal extracts leads to the increased expression of ATM-1 and ATL-1, validating
  the activation of the DNA damage response pathway. Gene expression levels between
  live and autoclaved OP50 were comparable, indicating that the nematocidal effects
  attributed to the herbal extracts may not be influenced by bacterial metabolism.
  Asterisks indicate statistical significance according to the two-tailed Mann–Whitney
  test. (C) Elevated pCHK-1 foci observed in germlines underscore the active DNA damage
  response following exposure to herbal extracts, confirming checkpoint activation.
  Bar = 2 µm. (D) Quantification of the number of pCHK-1 foci presented in (C). Asterisks
  indicate statistical significance according to the two-tailed Mann–Whitney test.
  (E) The pachytene stage revealed an increased level of apoptosis, suggesting that
  unrepaired DNA damage triggers checkpoint activation and subsequent apoptosis in
  the germline. V.I. and O.c. were added to a final concentration of 0.03 μg/mL. Asterisks
  indicate statistical significance according to the two-tailed Mann–Whitney test.
