caption: 'The role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in chemotherapy-related ovarian aging.
  At the starting exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs, cells undergo an adaptive response
  that activates Nrf2 to produce antioxidant products to protect the cells. However,
  when the dose of chemotherapeutic drugs is increased or the exposure time is prolonged,
  the cellular defense response is unable to completely resist the toxicity of chemotherapeutic
  drugs, which eventually leads to cellular dysfunction. Some of the material in the
  image was sourced from BioRender.com, accessed on 24 July 2023. The red line represents
  inhibition and the black line represents promotion. heme oxygenase 1: HO-1; NADP
  (H) quinone dehydrogenase 1: NQO1; glutathione peroxidase 4: GPX4'
