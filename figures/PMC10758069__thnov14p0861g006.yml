figure_title: SGK3 inhibiton partially reversed high phosphate-induced decrease in
  Pit-1 degradation triggered by the proteasome pathway.
caption: 'SGK3 inhibiton partially reversed high phosphate-induced decrease in Pit-1
  degradation triggered by the proteasome pathway. A. Mouse VSMCs treated with 50
  μM chloroquine (CQ) for 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h. The protein levels of Pit-1 and LC3B
  were measured by western blot. B. Mouse VSMCs treated with 10 μM MG132 for 4 h and
  8 h. The protein levels of Pit-1 were measured by western blot. *P < 0.05, ***P
  < 0.001 vs. the control group. C-D. Mouse VSMCs treated with 3 mM Pi (C) or transfected
  with SGK3-S486D plasmid (D) for 48 h, and MG132 was added for the last 8 h. A portion
  of the whole-cell lysate was also subjected to WB analysis as input. E. Mouse VSMCs
  transiently transfected with SGK3 siRNA for 48 h and then treated with or without
  MG132 for the last 8 h. The protein levels of Pit-1 and SGK3 were measured by western
  blot. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. SGK3-Si-/MG132- group; #P < 0.05 vs.
  SGK3-Si+/MG132- group. F. Mouse VSMCs transiently transfected with SGK3 siRNA in
  presence or absence of 3 mM for 48 h. A portion of the whole-cell lysate was also
  subjected to WB analysis as input'
