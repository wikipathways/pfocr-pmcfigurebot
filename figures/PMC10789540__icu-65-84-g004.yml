figure_title: Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3)-mediated TRAF6/MAPK/AP-1
  signaling pathway activation in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant renal
  cell carcinoma (RCC) cells and the 10 paired clear cell RCC tissues. (A) The results
  of MetaCore analysis using the transcriptome profile of the 10 paired pre- and post-TKI
  tumor tissues revealed that several TRAF6-related genes were up-regulated in post-TKI
  RCC. (B) An immunoprecipitation (IP) pull-down assay was performed to examine the
  interaction between IFITM3 and TRAF6 proteins in 786-O/suR cells. (C) The expression
  of IFITM3 with genes related to TRAF6/MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathways (TRAF6, p-ERK,
  and c-Fos), IRAK1, c-Myc, and survivin were upregulated in 786-O/suR compared with
  786-O/P. (D) All antibodies increased in post-TKI tissues compared with pre-TKI
  tissues with statistical significance in IRAK1 and survivin
