figure_title: Conditional deletion of Alix in adult mouse hippocampus reduces Notch
  signaling pathway activation
caption: |-
  (A) The levels of activated Notch1, activated Notch2, and Hes1 are significantly reduced in hippocampus from ~2-month-old Camk2a-cre::Alix
  fl/fl mice compared to Alix
  fl/fl mice. M = mouse.(B) Quantification of (A). n = 4 mouse per group. One-tailed Student’s t test. NS, not significant. Activated Notch1: *p value = 0.0143, activated Notch2: **p value = 0.0075, Notch1ICD: p value = 0.0942, Notch2ICD: p value = 0.4709, Hes1: *p value = 0.0218, Alix: ***p value = 5.346E-05.(C) Lack of Alix in adult hippocampus led to alteration of nuclear-localized Notch1ICD and Notch2ICD. Scale bar, 10 μm(D) Quantification of (C). n = 5 mouse per group. One-tailed Student’s t test. NS, not significant. Nucleic Notch1ICD/cytosolic Notch1ICD: CA1, **p value = 0.0042, CA3, **p value = 0.0037, DG, ***p value = 0.0002. Nucleic Notch2ICD/cytosolic Notch2ICD: CA1, **p value = 0.0026, CA3, ***p value = 0.0009, DG, p value = 0.3942
