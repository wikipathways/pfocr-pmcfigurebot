caption: Potential mechanisms for activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Once
  the cytokines bind to their receptors with intracellular signaling via Janus kinase,
  it triggers an intracellular signal transducer that causes the autophosphorylation
  and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of cytokine receptors associated with
  JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) and also triggers the phosphorylation of the STAT
  proteins. JAK-mediated STAT phosphorylation results in the phosphorylation and dimerization
  of STAT protein, nuclear translocation, and induction of transcription of inflammatory
  cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor alpha
  (TNF-Î±), and interferons (IFN)
