figure_title: (a) Genetic organization of plasmid pP62BP1.
caption: '(a) Genetic organization of plasmid pP62BP1. Arrows indicate the open reading
  frames. Colors correspond to the main genetic modules of the plasmid: replication
  and partition module (REP + PAR); restriction–modification systems (R-M1, R-M2);
  and the SLF module. (b) Predicted metabolic pathway catalyzed by the products of
  genes identified within the SLF module (slfCHSL) [17]. (c) Growth of Psychrobacter
  sp. DAB_AL62B and DAB_AL43 (negative control) on LB medium supplemented with SDS
  to the final concentration of 0.005% (0.35 mM) and Stains-All dye. Zones of SDS
  degradation are visible as purple areas (image saturation was increased to 130%
  to emphasize the difference in color)'
