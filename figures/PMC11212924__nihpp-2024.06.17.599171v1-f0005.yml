figure_title: The TIR1/AFB-based nuclear pathway is required for the expression of
  the IBR auxin-biosynthetic genes that contribute to auxin maxima at the tip of cotyledons
caption: (A) Induction of ECH2 and IBR10 gene expression by auxin was compromised
  in tir1Qt. Auxin treatment and qRT-PCR analysis of ECH2 and IBR10 expression in
  wild type Col-0 and tir1Qt III as described in Methods. The graph informs 3 biological
  replicates, each reaction is performed with 3 technical replicates. t-test, *p<0.05.
  (B) Tip-high DR5::GUS expression in 48 HAP cotyledons was greatly reduced in the
  ech2−/−;ibr10−/− double mutant. (C) Auxin restored the PC interdigitation defect
  in the ech2−/−;ibr10−/− mutant. Seedlings were grown for 4 days in 20 nM NAA. Scale
  bar = 50 μm. (D) Lobes per cell of cotyledons shown in C. Split violins show mock
  (opaque) and NAA treatment (translucent) values, for each genotype. Box plot inside
  each violin plot depicts four quartiles and the median. Red dot depicts the average.
  Split violins for each genotype show values obtained from mock (opaque) and NAA-treated
  (translucent) cotyledons. n = 298–569 cells from 10 cotyledons. t-test, ****p<0.0001
