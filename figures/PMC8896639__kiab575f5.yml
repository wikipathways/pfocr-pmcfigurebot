caption: Time-dependent response of OsBOR1 and OsLsi1 proteins to high B supply in
  rice roots. A–L, Localization of OsBOR1 and OsLsi1 in the root tip (A–F) and mature
  region (G–L) of crown root. M and N, Signal intensity of OsBOR1 (M) and OsLsi1 (N).
  Transgenic seedlings (21-d-old) harboring Flag-OsLsi1 were precultured in a solution
  free of B (−B) for 3 d and then transferred to a solution containing 30 μM B. At
  different time points including 0.5, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h, tip region (3 mm from root
  tip) and mature region (15 mm) of crown roots were sampled for double immunostaining
  of OsBOR1 and Flag-OsLsi1. Magenta color shows signal from OsBOR1, green color shows
  signal from Flag-OsLsi1, and blue color from cell wall autoﬂuorescence and nuclei
  staind by DAPI. Scale bars indicate 50 µm. The signal intensities of OsBOR1 and
  OsLsi1 were quantified by LAS AF Lite software and the intensity relative to −B
  condition is shown. All pictures were taken under the same conditions. Data are
  means ± sd (n = 8–16). Different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05
  by Tukey–Kramer’s test.
