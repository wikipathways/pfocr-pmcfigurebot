caption: CRFB5 involvement in the poly (I:C)-induced immune response via the JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway. (A) Expression profile of CRFB5 in silver carp spleen (A) and
  HKCs (B) stimulated by poly (I:C). (B) Poly (I:C) stimulated HKCs in a time gradient
  manner, and the expression levels of CRFB5 and phosphorylated P-TYK2 were detected
  by Western blotting. (C) After the co-transfection of EPC cells with the full-length
  expression plasmid pCDNA3.1-CRFB5 or the negative control pCDNA3.1, along with the
  IRSE luciferin reporter plasmid or STAT1 at 48 h, poly (I:C) was used to activate
  the cells for 6 h. Luciferase activity was measured. (D,E) Silver carp HKCs were
  transfected with si-CRFB5-3 or si-NC for 48 h. The cells were then stimulated for
  6 h with poly (I:C). Protein expression levels of CRFB5 and P-TYK2 were detected
  by Western blotting (D), while the expression of antiviral genes (PKR, MX1, ISG15,
  and IFN-I) was detected by RT-qPCR (E). The data are presented as mean Â± SD (n =
  3). Significance is shown as *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 in comparison to the controls
