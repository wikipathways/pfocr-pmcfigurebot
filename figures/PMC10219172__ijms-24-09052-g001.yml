caption: A model for the synthesis and decomposition of nitric oxide. NO is synthesized
  mainly through a nitrate/nitrite-dependent reduction pathway or through an NO synthase
  (NOS)-mediated oxidative pathway. NO is decomposed mainly by interacting with oxygen,
  ROS or GSH. NR; NO-forming nitrite reductase (NOFNiR); mitochondrial nitrite reductase
  electron transport chain (mETC); polyamines (PAs); GSNO reductase (GSNOR)
