caption: Overview of the bioinformatic workflow for reconstructing the carbohydrate
  and glycan metabolic pathways of the A. fulica snail based on the GhostKOALA assignment
  (grey arrows). The 367 proteins were confirmed by cross-checking with pathway and
  protein member information (brown arrow). The pathway gaps are successfully filled
  with additional enzymes by adjusting the KEGG pathway search parameters, manual
  curation, and protein domain and structure prediction (blue arrows). The unrelated
  proteins were removed from the candidate list (red arrows)
