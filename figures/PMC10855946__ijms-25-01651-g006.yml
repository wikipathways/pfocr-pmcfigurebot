caption: 'Summary diagram of Met-PA pathway analysis (all data are expressed as mean
  SD). (A) The relative peak area abundance of palmitic acid in CXCL14−/− 8-week-old
  mice was significantly lower than that in CXCL14+/− 8-week-old mice. (n = 10, *:
  p < 0.05). (B) The relative peak area abundance of linoleic acid in CXCL14−/− 8-week-old
  mice was significantly lower than that in CXCL14+/− 8-week-old mice. (n = 10, ***:
  p < 0.001). (C) The relative peak area abundance of α-linolenic acid in CXCL14−/−
  8-week-old mice was significantly lower than that in CXCL14+/− 8-week-old mice.
  (n = 10, *: p < 0.05). (D) Pathway analysis of differential metabolites for plasma
  between CXCL14+/− (W) and CXCL14−/− (C) mice by LC-MS metabolomics. (E) Differential
  metabolites in the biosynthetic pathway of unsaturated fatty acid'
