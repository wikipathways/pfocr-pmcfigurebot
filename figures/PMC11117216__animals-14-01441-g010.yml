caption: The regulatory mechanism of Y-27632 and AA on goat sperm metabolism. (A)
  The regulatory mechanism of ROCK pathway inhibitor Y-27632 on sperm metabolism in
  goats. (B) The regulatory mechanism of ROCK pathway activator AA on sperm metabolism
  in goats. Gly, glycine; Ala, alanine; Thr, threonine; Leu, leucine; Glu, glutamate;
  Gln, glutamine; MDA, malonaldehyde; CAT, catalase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; αKG, α-Ketoglutaric acid; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential;
  I, II, III, IV, and V represents the respiratory chain
