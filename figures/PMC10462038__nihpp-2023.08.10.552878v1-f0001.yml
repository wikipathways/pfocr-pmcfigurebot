caption: Host scRNA-seq data acquired through the public domain from one sample of
  cervical cancer tissue were aligned to human and HPV reference genomes, respectively.
  The sequencing expression matrix of the host and virus was generated and combined
  into Seurat for cell clustering and annotation. Inter-cluster and intra-cluster
  comparisons were analyzed on epithelial cell clusters based on whether the cells
  were HPV+ or HPV-. The HPV+ epithelial cells were further divided into E6+/E7+ and
  E6-/E7- cells. Downstream analyses such as differential expression analysis, pathway
  enrichment analysis, and gene expression correlation analysis were conducted to
  reveal the cellular heterogeneity of HPV-infected epithelial cells and the relationship
  between host and viral gene expressions
