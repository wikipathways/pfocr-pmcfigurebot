caption: Cell–cell communication analysis of DT cells in LUAD. (A) Number of interactions
  among cell subtypes. (B) Heatmap of signaling pathways. (C,D) Comparison of the
  ligand–receptor pairs related to IGF (C) and ICAM (D) signaling pathways in LUAD
  cells. (E) The t-SNE plots of 57,166 cells classified by O-glycosylation genes.
  High, high O-glycosylation subtype; Low, low O-glycosylation subtype. (F) Number
  and intensity of interactions between high and low O-glycosylation cell types. (G)
  Overview of the comparison of ligand–receptor interactions between high and low
  O-glycosylation groups. Red represents the high O-glycosylation group having more
  interactions than the low group, otherwise colored blue. (H) Bar plot of the relative
  proportion of interaction strengths for each signal between the high and low O-glycosylation
  groups. (I) Heatmap of the incoming signal across two groups. (J) Schematic representation
  of O-glycosylation linking fibroblast action with DT cells by regulating the IGF
  signaling pathway
