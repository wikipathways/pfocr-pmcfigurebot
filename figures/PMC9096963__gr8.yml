caption: Dual mechanism of regulation of cellular actin polymerization through the
  cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. A significant increase in F-actin content associated
  with reduction in membrane cholesterol was observed under chronic cholesterol depleted
  conditions. Cholesterol depletion utilizing lovastatin (a proximal inhibitor of
  the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway) and AY 9944 (a distal inhibitor of the cholesterol
  biosynthesis pathway) suggested specific contributions of protein prenylation (pathway
  I) and PI(4,5)P2 (pathway II) underlying the altered F-actin dynamics. Whereas protein
  prenylation is an important post-translational modification of a variety of small
  GTPase proteins that are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, PI(4,5)P2 is
  a phospholipid that mediates the crosstalk between the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton
  network via binding to cytoskeletal proteins and actin nucleators. Lovastatin is
  a specific metabolic inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzyme
  upstream of isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. On
  the other hand, AY 9944 is a specific metabolic inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase (7-DHCR), the last enzyme in the Kandutsch-Russell pathway of cholesterol
  biosynthesis, that catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol.
  The two-way color scheme (inhibition [gray] and operational [blue]) is suggestive
  of modulation of specific steps upon lovastatin (right half of the pathway) and
  AY 9944 (left half of the pathway). The dotted arrows represent multiple biosynthesis
  steps. See text for more details.
