caption: 'Screening the metabolic pathways involved in CTH and CBS based on KEGG pathway.
  (A) Candidate pathways for CTH and CBS; both involvements were selected from 45
  significantly different pathways from KEGG annotation. (B) Seven genes were screened
  to be significantly regulated in all three pathways. (C) Volcano plot shows the
  positions of the 7 genes significantly regulated. Vertical dashed lines are drawn
  at log2(fold change) = −2 and 2, representing the thresholds for significantly down-regulated
  and up-regulated genes, respectively; The horizontal dashed line is positioned at
  −log10(FDR) = 1.3, indicating the significance threshold of FDR = 0.05. (D) Heatmap
  shows the clustering of the 7 significantly regulated genes. Red font highlights
  key enzymes involved in H2S synthesis, including CTH and CBS. (E) The PPI network
  of DEPs’ interaction with CTH and CBS in three pathways. Yellow represents proteins
  that interact with CBS or CTH, respectively. Blue represents 12 proteins that interact
  with both CTH and CBS. Con: Poll glands group during indistinct estrus. Exp: Poll
  glands group during vigorous estrus. Data are presented as median (rank). * Represents
