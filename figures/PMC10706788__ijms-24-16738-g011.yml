caption: Schematic representation of the pathway of glutathione metabolism by EHP
  in the early stages of infection. Red boxes represent up-regulated DEGs, green boxes
  represent down-regulated DEGs, metabolites in yellow boxes are up-regulated SDMs,
  and metabolites in blue boxes are down-regulated SDMs
