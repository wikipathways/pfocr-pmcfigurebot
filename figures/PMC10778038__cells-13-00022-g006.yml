caption: Dose-dependent activation of necroptotic and apoptotic pathways by EAHDT
  in Huh7-derived LCSCs. (A,B) Huh7 LCSCs were exposed to EAHDT (5, 10, 20, 40 μg/mL)
  for 48 h. Protein levels of necroptosis and apoptosis regulators were detected by
  Western blot analysis using specific antibodies and further quantified by densitometry.
  β-Actin levels were used as a loading control. (C) Huh7 LCSCs were pretreated with
  necrostatin-1 (20 μM) for 1 h and then exposed to EAHDT (10, 20, 40 μg/mL) for 48
  h. Cell viability was analyzed using the CellTiter-Glo® luminescence assay. * p
