figure_title: Dissecting Osmostress regulation of Volume Change, Cell Growth and Hog1
  Signaling
caption: This figure presents an illustration of the conventional Hog1 signaling in
  yeast stress response pathway and our proposed gradual stress paradigms. (A) In
  accordance with the established model of osmotic stress regulation in yeast, that
  is based on acute stress, osmotic stress activates Hog1 signaling and inhibits cell
  growth in an osmotic concentration stress dependent manner. Osmotic stress triggers
  the activation of and double phosphorylation of Hog1 MAPK, via the HOG signal transduction
  pathway. Dual Hog1 phosphorylation leads to its translocation to the nucleus, where
  it regulates stress-responsive genes. The concerted action of Hog1 phosphorylation
  and the gene responses contributes to the regulation of glycerol production and
  maintenance, facilitating osmoadaptation. (B) We applied different stress paradigms
  including acute (blue) and gradual (cyan and purple) changes to investigate the
  relationship between osmotic stress, cell volume change, Hog1 signaling, and cell
  growth
