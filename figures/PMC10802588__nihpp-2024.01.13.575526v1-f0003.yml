caption: A) SK-Mel28 cells (control/KO/KI) were seeded on PLL-coated coverslips and
  treated with DMSO or 100μg/ml bleomycin for 1 hour. Cells were fixed and stained
  for Syn1, γH2AX, and DAPI. Mean intensity of γH2AX signal within DAPI masks were
  analyzed using FIJI. ** p<0.01, **** p<0.0001 by ANOVA. Error bars denote SEM. Quantification
  from 3 biological replicates. Same γH2AX quantification between graphs with control
  cells. B) SK-Mel28 cells (control/KO/KI) were treated with DMSO or 100μg/ml bleomycin
  for 1 hour and lysed and a nuclear fractionation was performed. Nuclear protein
  was run out on SDS-PAGE and probed for γH2AX and total protein. Western blots were
  imaged on Licor CLx imager. * p<0.05, **** p<0.0001. Error bars denote SEM. Quantification
  from 4 biological replicates. C) SK-Mel28 cells were seeded in a black-welled PDL-coated
  96 well plate and treated with DMSO or 100μg/ml bleomycin for 1 hour. Cells were
  processed according to the In-Cell Western manufacturer instructions and stained
  for γH2AX (800) and CellTag (700). Plates were imaged on the Licor CLx. ** p<0.01,
  *** p<0.001, **** p<0.0001 by ANOVA. Error bars denote SEM. Quantification from
  3 biological replicates. D) SK-Mel28 cells (control/KO/KI) were seeded on PLL-coated
  coverslips and treated with DMSO or 100μg/ml bleomycin for 1 hour. Cells were fixed
  and stained for Syn1, γH2AX, nucleostemin, and DAPI. Mean intensity of γH2AX signal
  within nucleostemin and DAPI masks were analyzed using FIJI. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001, **** p<0.0001 by ANOVA. Error bars denote SEM. N=nucleus, Nu=nucleolus.
  Quantification from 3 biological replicates. E) SK-Mel28 cells were seeded on PDL-coated
  coverslips, treated with DMSO or 100μg/ml bleomycin for 1 hour, and fixed in 4%
  paraformaldehyde. DNA Damage In Situ Ligation Followed by Proximity Ligation Assay
  (Duolink) was completed as previously described (Galbiati and Fagagna, 2019) using
  a DNA linker and Syn1. Cells were imaged on the Zeiss 980 confocal microscope and
  number of foci per nucleus was measured using CellProfiler within nuclear masking
  with DAPI. Each figure shows representative images and quantification from 3 biological
  replicates. ****p<0.0001 by ANOVA. Error bars denote SEM
