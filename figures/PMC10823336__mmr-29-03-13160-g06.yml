figure_title: Inhibition of the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway inhibits titanium
  particle-induced proinflammatory responses.
caption: Inhibition of the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway inhibits titanium particle-induced
  proinflammatory responses. (A) Inhibition of the NOD1 signaling pathway inhibited
  MAPK and NF-κB signaling activation induced by titanium particle treatment. (B)
  Inhibition of the NOD1 signaling pathway inhibited proinflammatory cytokine expression
  induced by titanium particle treatment. The control group in this figure were osteoblasts
  without inhibitors. Data are representative of three independent experiments and
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
