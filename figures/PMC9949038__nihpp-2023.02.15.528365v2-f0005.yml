figure_title: MHC-I pathway downregulation by Cracd KO
caption: A, Total cell-cell interactions (left) and interaction strength (right) from
  RPR2 and CRPR2 tumors were analyzed using the CellChat package.B, Chord plots showing
  up-regulated (left) and down-regulated (right) signaling pathways in the CRPR2 scRNA-seq
  dataset compared to the RPR2 dataset, analyzed using CellChat. The inner bar colors
  represent the cell clusters that receive signals. The inner bar size is proportional
  to the signal strength received by the cell clusters. Chords indicate ligand-receptor
  pairs that mediate the interaction between two cell clusters. The chord size is
  proportional to the signal strength of the given ligand-receptor pair. Of note,
  for a CellChat analysis, RPR2 and CRPR2 scRNA-seq datasets were reanalyzed and reannotated
  with the R package Seurat. Tumor cells were subclustered into nine clusters for
  CellChat.C, Overall information flow (upper) and relative information flow (lower)
  of each signaling pathway in RPR2 and CRPR2 tumors, analyzed using CellChat.D, Circle
  plots displaying the inferred network of the MHC-I signaling pathway in RPR2 (left)
  and CRPR2 tumors (right); the thickness of each line connecting the cell clusters
  indicates the interaction strength, analyzed using CellChat.E, GSEA of gene sets
  associated with the MHC-I pathway in CRPR2 datasets compared to in RPR2 scRNA-seq
  datasets; NES, normalized enrichment score.F, Dot plot displaying the expression
  level of the MHC-I pathwayâ€“related genes in the RPR2 and CRPR2 datasets
