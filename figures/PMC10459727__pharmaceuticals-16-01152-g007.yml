figure_title: The effect of GP-14 on the NF-κB signaling pathway in C8 cells and primary
  astrocytes.
caption: The effect of GP-14 on the NF-κB signaling pathway in C8 cells and primary
  astrocytes. (A–C) The C8 cells were subjected to various concentrations of GP-14
  for a duration of 6 h. Subsequently, the cells were exposed to 100 ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) for another 6 h, with some cells being left untreated. QPCR measured the levels
  of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. (D) Protein bands of phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα), phosphorylated
  p65 (p-p65), total-IκBα (t-IκBα), total-p65 (t-p65), and β-actin in C8 cells. (E,F)
  Quantification of protein bands for phosphorylated-IκBα and phosphorylated-p65 in
  C8 cells. (G–I) The primary astrocytes were treated with different doses of GP-14
  for 6 h, followed by treatment with or without 100 ng/mL of LPS for 6 h. The levels
  of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were measured in primary astrocytes using qPCR. (J) Protein
  bands of phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα), total IκBα (t-IκBα), phosphorylatedp65 (p-p65),
  total-p65 (t-p65), and β-actin in primary astrocytes. (K,L) Quantification of protein
  bands of phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα) and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) in primary
  astrocytes. The results are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3), * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01. ns means no significant difference
