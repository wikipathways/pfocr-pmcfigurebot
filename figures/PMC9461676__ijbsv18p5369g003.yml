caption: CAFs has diverse sources and is differentiated from epithelial cells, mesenchyme
  stem cells, resident fibrohlast, HSCs, pericyte, adipocyte, vascular smooth muscle
  cells, and bone marrow fibrocytes. CAFs from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) mediate
  the release of hepatocyte growth factor from inflammatory CAFs through direct interaction
  of the hsc-cafa-tumor pathway and promote the proliferation of ICC through tumor-expressed
  MET. VCAFs (vascular carcinoma-associated fibroblasts) secrete IL-6 (interleukin-6)
  to enhance the malignancy of ICC cells through the interaction of the IL-6/IL-6R
  axis with tumor cells, while exosomal miR-95p of ICC cells can induce IL-6 expression
  in vCAFs. High expression of miR-34c in tumor-derived exosomes can target and inhibit
  Wnt1, allowing it to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in CCA and slow the conversion
  of fibrocytes to CAFs. Nintedanib can treat refractory CCA by inhibiting the activation
  of CAFs.
