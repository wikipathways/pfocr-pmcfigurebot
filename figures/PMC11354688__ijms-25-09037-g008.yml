  (GI) tract.
caption: The action mechanism of metformin in the liver and gastrointestinal (GI)
  tract. Metformin boosts the AMPK pathway in the liver through the lysosomal pathway
  and an increase (↑) of ADP:ATP and AMP:ADP ratios. A series of reactions can lead
  to the decrease (↓) of gluconeogenesis. On the other hand, metformin causes a change
  in gut microbiota in the GI tract, as well as an increase (↑) in GLP-1 secretion,
  which further enhances (↑) the glycolytic pathway. Finally, the action of metformin
  results in increased sugar consumption and decreased sugar production
