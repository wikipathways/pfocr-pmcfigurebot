figure_title: Role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in HpD-PDT treatment.
caption: Role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in HpD-PDT treatment. (A) Phosphorylation
  levels of PI3K, AKT and mTOR were detected by western blotting. The expression levels
  of apoptosis-related proteins were also detected (mean ± SD; n=3; *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001 vs. control group). (B) PTEN expression was measured
  by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR 24 h after laser irradiation (mean ± SD;
  n=3; ***P<0.001 vs. control group). (C) Effect of combined treatment on cell viability
  was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay 24 h after laser irradiation (*P<0.05
  and **P<0.01). (D) Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis in KYSE-150 cells was performed
  based on Annexin V/PI staining. (E) Cell apoptosis was higher in the combination
  group than in the HpD-PDT alone group (mean ± SD; n=3; LY294002 + HpD-PDT group
  vs. HpD-PDT group; *P<0.05, ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001). (F) Representative images
  of cellular migration after different treatments (scale bar, 100 µm). The original
  images were converted to grayscale images using ImageJ. (G) Combination of HpD-PDT
  with LY294002 could enhance the efficiency of inhibition of cell migration compared
  with that observed for HpD-PDT alone (mean ± SD; n=3; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001).
  (H) Phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT and mTOR in the LY294002 + HpD-PDT group
  were detected by western blotting. The protein expression levels of BAX and Bcl-2
  were also detected (mean ± SD; n=3; *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001).
