caption: 'HIF-1α mediated induction of selective mitophagy under hypoxia. (a) Mechanism
  HIF-1α mediated upregulation of mitophagy response: HIF-1α gets stabilized and transacts
  various genes that regulate the cellular adaptive mechanisms under low oxygen tension
  under hypoxic stress. It promotes the glycolytic pathway for energy production and
  participates in the expression of PDK, which inhibits pyruvate entry into the TCA
  cycle. Hypoxia also disrupts MMP potential and produces ROS, which supports HIF-1α
  stabilization by inhibiting PHD-2 and FIH-1. TCA intermediates inhibit both enzymes
  due to competitive inhibition of their substrate. HIF upregulates the expression
  of the mitophagy receptors BNIP3 and NIX, which are essential in mitophagy induction.
  (b) Source of ROS generation in ETC: under hypoxia, insufficient O2 and accidental
  escape of electrons lead to ROS production. In anaerobic glycolysis, the NAD+/NADH
  ratio is altered in the cytoplasm, disturbing the MMP and translational modification
  of ETC components. ETC components, incredibly complexes I and III, cannot do the
  regular electron transportation and work as a host for ROS generation. Excessive
  ROS potentiates mitochondria''s membrane integrity, leading to activation of the
  PINK-1/PARKIN pathway that involves ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy. (c) Role of BNIP3,
  BNIP3L/NIX, and FUNDC1 proteins in mitophagy: mitophagy receptors BNIP3, BNIP3L/NIX,
  and FUNDC1 are strongly expressed at the OMM of mitochondria in response to hypoxia.
  Under normoxia, CK2 and Src enzymes are responsible for phosphorylation at Ser13
  and Tyr18 residues of FUNDC1, respectively. The phosphorylated FUNDC1 decreases
  the affinity towards binding with LC3B. The phosphorylated FUNDC1 is targeted for
  ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase by
  MARCH5. Under hypoxic conditions, dephosphorylation of FUNDC1 protein is carried
  out through the mitochondrial phosphatase PGAM5. The activity of PGAM5 is dynamically
  regulated by Bcl-2L1/BCL-xL protein through its BH3 domain. Bcl-2L1/BCL-xL proteins
  are situated on OMM during normoxia, but they do not interact with FUNDC1, although
  they do interact with PGAM5. After that, PGAM5 becomes inactive and inhibits dephosphorylation
  of FUNDC1, subsequently decreasing mitophagy. During hypoxia, PGAM5-Bcl-2L1/BCL-xL
  complex is dissociated, and Bcl-2L1/BCL-xL is degraded; a free form of PGAM5 interacted
  with FUNDC1 leads to dephosphorylation at Ser13, and Tyr18 residues of FUNDC1 subsequently
  interact with LC3B and trigger the mitochondrial autophagosome-mediated degradation.
  At the same time, BNIP3/NIX is upregulated and involved in the induction of mitophagy.
  Under normoxia, BECN1, which is linked to BCL-xL/Bcl-2 and the BNIP3/NIX protein,
  is still inactive. Under hypoxia, the BCL-xL/Bcl-2 proteins dissociate, allowing
  BECN1 to be released, which aids autophagosome formation and engulfs/envelops mitochondria
  for lysosomal degradation. BNIP3/NIX undergoes homodimerization and phosphorylation
  of Ser17 and Ser24 residues of proteins under hypoxia, and it interacts with LC3B,
  causing mitochondrial breakdown by increasing fission protein expression and decreasing
  OPA1 activity. Fission and fusion process in mitophagy: the fusion phenomenon also
  participates as the supplementary effect of mitophagy induction. The mitophagy receptors
  promote the fission process by upregulating the activity of the fission proteins
  Drp1 and Fis1. These proteins are also located on OMM and form the contact site
  for mitochondrial fragmentation. Under hypoxia, these proteins are upregulated in
  dysregulated mitochondria and in healthy mitochondria that induce mitochondrial
  segregation into the smaller fragment that is easily encapsulated by autophagosome
  for their degradation. In comparison, mitophagy receptors downregulate fusion activity
  under hypoxic response. The fusion protein, mainly OPA1, is involved in mitochondria''s
  fusion activity, which is inhibited by mitophagy receptors. (d) The PINK-1/Parkin
  pathway for mitophagy induction: PINK-1/PARKIN pathway-induced mitophagy works in
  a ubiquitin-dependent manner. PINK-1 is transported into the IMM during normoxia,
  wherein it is cleaved by several proteases and finally degraded by ubiquitination.
  However, in hypoxia, dissipated MMP prevents entry of PINK-1 into the IMM, leading
  to accumulation of PINK-1 at OMM of mitochondria, wherein PINK-1 undergoes autophosphorylation
  which helps in phosphorylation as well as recruitment of PARKIN. The collection
  of PINK-1/PARKIN on the OMM triggers the E3 ubiquitin system which leads to mitochondrial
  autophagy.'
