figure_title: Altered transcriptome in mOLs lacking Lmna
caption: '(B) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05) in FACS mOLs
  isolated from 8-week-old Lmna mutant mice (Ndrg1-EGFP;CnpCre/+;Lmnafl/fl, n = 3)
  and control mice (Ndrg1-EGFP;Cnp+/+;Lmnafl/fl, n = 3). After quality control, the
  following samples were used for differential expression analysis: n = 2 Lmna mutant
  and n = 2 control samples. Red dots represent significantly upregulated genes (n
  = 668), and blue dots represent significantly downregulated genes (n = 538).(C)
  Gene expression heatmaps of upregulated biological process Gene Ontology (GO) terms
  in significantly upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue) genes in Lmna mutant
  mOLs (Ndrg1-EGFP;CnpCre/+;Lmnafl/fl) compared with control cells (Ndrg1-EGFP;Cnp+/+;Lmnafl/fl).
  Genes annotated for the GO terms “cell migration,” “PDGFR signaling pathway,” and
  “modulation of synaptic transmission” are shown.(C) Visualization of ATAC-seq peaks
  in control (n = 6, black) and Lmna mutant (n = 5, red) OLs at the distal intergenic
  region of Cd44. Data were visualized using the WashU Epigenome Browser. The scale
  on the y axis was selected for optimal visualization of peaks.(D) Scatterplot of
  Cd44 transcript levels measured by real-time qPCR in RNA samples extracted from
  cultured OPCs isolated from WT (Cnp+/+;Lmnafl/fl) and Lmna mutant mice (CnpCre/+;Lmnafl/fl)
  and differentiated in vitro. Data were normalized to the geometric (GEO)-mean of
  Gapdh, 18S, and Wdr33 transcript levels. Data represent average levels ± SD, n =
  3 independent cultures per group (***p < 0.001, two-tailed Student’s t test).(E)
  Representative confocal images of the corpus callosum of WT (Cnp+/+;Lmnafl/fl) and
  Lmna mutant 26-week-old mice (CnpCre/+;Lmnafl/fl). Sections were stained with CD44
  (green) and OLIG2 (red). DAPI (blue) was used as counterstain. Scale bar, 5 μm.(F)
  Scatterplot of the number of CD44+/CC1+ cells per mm2 corpus callosum in control
  mice (Cnp+/+;Lmnafl/fl, n = 3) and Lmna mutant mice (CnpCre/+;Lmnafl/fl, n = 3).
  Data represent average percentages ± SD (**p < 0.01, two-tailed Student’s t test).(G)
  Heatmap of the transcript levels within the “mitochondrial inner membrane” GO category,
  showing downregulation (blue) in sorted mOLs lacking Lmna (Ndrg1-EGFP;CnpCre/+;Lmnafl/fl)
  compared with control cells (Ndrg1-EGFP;Cnp+/+;Lmnafl/fl).(H) Scatterplot of the
  mitochondrial transcript Atp5e (C) and Ndufb5 (D) levels measured by real-time qPCR
  in RNA samples extracted from Lmna mutant (CnpCre/+; Lmnafl/fl) and control (Cnp+/+;Lmnafl/fl)
  OLs, differentiated in cultures from neonatal OPCs. Data were normalized to the
  geometric (GEO)-mean of Gapdh and Wdr33 transcript levels. Data are represented
  as mean ± SD, n = 3 independent cultures per group (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, two-tailed
  Student’s t test).(I) Electron microscopy image of OLs in the ventral horn of the
  spinal cord of Lmna mutant (CnpCre/+;Lmnafl/fl) and control (Cnp+/+;Lmnafl/fl) mice.
  Scale bar, 1 μm. The insets represent higher-magnification images of the mitochondrial
  structure in OLs from mice of the two genotypes to highlight the loss of internal
  cristae definition in mOLs lacking LMNA. Scale bar, 0.5 μm.See also Tables S1 and
