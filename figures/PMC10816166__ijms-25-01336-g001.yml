caption: Effect of exogenous EBR treatment on the growth and development of tomato
  seedlings and the expression of key genes in the BR signaling pathway. (A) Phenotype
  of tomato seedlings. (B) Plant height, stem thickness and fresh weight. (C) Expression
  levels of key genes (BRI1, BZR1, SERK3B and SERK3A) in the BR signaling pathway.
  Expression values were normalized to the control for each gene. Bars are means ±
  SD of three biological replicates. Asterisks indicate significant differences between
  BR treatment and control groups (* p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤0.001, **** p ≤
  0.0001). The number 1 means standardize the control group, namely, the expression
  level of control divided by itself
