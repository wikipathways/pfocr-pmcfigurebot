caption: HER2 signalling. HER2 is composed of four extracellular domains (Iâ€“IV) and
  a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. Activation of HER2-mediated RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathways occurs by heterodimerization with ligand-activated
  EGFR, HER3, or HER4, or by homodimerization when it is present in high concentrations.
  Unlike other ERBB family members, HER2 does not directly bind to any known ligands
