caption: 'Mechanism of persistent organic pollutant (POP)-induced obesity: (upper
  panel) illustration showing interaction of advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
  and receptor of AGE (RAGE) in cells (including adipocytes). AGE binds to RAGE expressed
  in cells as well as in the extracellular matrix (ECM), altering the structure of
  ECM and causing cellular damage. (Lower panel) diagram illustrating the effect of
  phthalate, DDT and PBDE in adipogenesis. Phthalate and DDT induce stem cells to
  differentiate to adipocytes. PBDE binds to the peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-gamma (PPAR-Î³) and enhances lipid accumulation. An upward red arrow indicates
  an increase and a downward red arrow indicates a decrease in the rate of the specified
  metabolic pathway'
