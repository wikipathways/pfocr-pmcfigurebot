caption: 'Illustration of NETs, ROS, cancer mitochondrial oxidative damage and altered
  glucose metabolism, including the Warburg effect and glucose metabolic reprogramming,
  in human cancers is shown. Beneficial events from the Warburg effect are sketched
  and described in text sections, including 7.1: Increased antioxidant activity, 7.2:
  Rapid energy production, 7.3: Suppression of anticancer immunity and 7.4: Increased
  nucleic acid synthesis. Synthesis of macromolecules through glucose metabolic reprogramming
