caption: Bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptome sequencing results of cells.
  (A) RNA-seq data from cell samples were subjected to principal component analysis
  (PCA). (B) Cell sample correlation heatmap for the control and TGF-treated groups.
  (C) DEGs counts in the control and TGF-treated groups. (D) Cellular DEGs were shown
  by GO and KEGG analysis to be upregulated in pathways associated with epithelial
  cell migration, ECM, and the inflammatory response in the TGF-β1-treated group (the
  red underline indicates the focus of attention). (E) Potential enhancement of EMT,
  the inflammatory response, and the NF-κB pathway in cells was examined using GSEA.
  (F) The ratios of the NF-κB pathway protein P-P65/P65 and IKBα expression in cells
  treated with TGF-β1 were examined by Western blotting. The data are presented as
  the mean ± SD; ** p < 0.01; ns, not significant
