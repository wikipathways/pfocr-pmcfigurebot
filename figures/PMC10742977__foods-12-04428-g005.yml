figure_title: Effect of WPH and treadmill exercise on relative protein expression
  levels of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.
caption: |-
  Effect of WPH and treadmill exercise on relative protein expression levels of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. NOR, normal; CON, control; EXR, exercise; WPH-L/H, low-dose/high-dose whey protein hydrolysate; EWPH_L/H, exercise + low-dose/high-dose whey protein hydrolysate. Western blot images of MAPKs (A). Relative protein levels of p-JNK/JNK (B), p-ERK/ERK (C), and p-p38/p38 (D) were determined using Western blot. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. NOR group; #
  p < 0.05, ##
  p < 0.01, ###
  p < 0.001 vs. CON group (analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey’s test)
