figure_title: Anticancer properties of glycyrrhizinic acid.
caption: Anticancer properties of glycyrrhizinic acid. Gly has oncopreventive and
  oncotherapeutic properties against different cancer models by modulating different
  cellular signaling pathways and interfering with viral oncoproteins that lead to
  an antiproliferative, proapototic, antimetastatic, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory
  and antioxidant action. (Red Xâ€™s mean that Gly blocks those steps; down and up arrows
  respectively mean that Gly represses or induces those proteins)
