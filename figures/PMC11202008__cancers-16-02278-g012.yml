caption: Comparison analysis of the canonical networks showed different activation
  patterns for TK.007-expressing and wild-type cells treated with GCV. Change in status
  (inhibition to activation or vice versa) of 15 pathways between the K562 wild-type
  and K562 TK.007 cells (both after treatment), and 21 pathways changed status between
  PaCa5061 wild-type and PaCa5061 TK.007 cells
