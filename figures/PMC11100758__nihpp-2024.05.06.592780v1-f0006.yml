figure_title: Inhibiting ether lipid synthesis suppresses ferroptosis in lipid-starved
  cells
caption: 'A, Schematic illustrating the ether lipid synthesis pathway and an AGPS
  inhibitor. FAR1, fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1; GNPAT, glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase;
  AGPS, alkylglycerone phosphate synthase; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P,
  glycerol 3-phosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. B, C, Relative FAR1 (B) and AGPS
  (C) gene expression in the indicated cells cultured in lipid-depleted versus lipid-replete
  media for 24 h. D, Immunoblot for AGPS and β-actin in the indicated cells cultured
  in lipid-depleted versus lipid-replete media for 24 h. E-G, Cell death of A549 (E),
  HeLa (F), and Panc1 (G) cells treated with 1 μM RSL3 for 24 h after initial pre-treatment
  of cells in lipid-depleted versus lipid-replete media, with or without 150 μM AGPS-IN-2i,
  for 24 h. H, I, Heat map showing relative levels of PEs (H) or PCs (I) containing
  at least one PUFA in A549 cells cultured in lipid-replete or lipid-depleted media,
  with or without 150 μM AGPS-IN-2i, for 24 h. Blue boxes highlight ether phospholipid
  species that decrease upon AGPS-IN-2i treatment. Orange boxes highlight diacyl phospholipid
  species that increase upon AGPS-IN-2i treatment. J, K, Cells were pulse labeled
  with [U-13C]-18:2(n-6), followed by a chase period prior to lipid extraction and
  analysis, as shown in Fig. 3A. Relative levels of [M+18] labeled PUFAs in the non-polar
  (J) or polar (K) lipid fractions from A549 cells post-pulse and after the chase
  period into lipid-replete media or lipid-depleted media, with or without 150 μM
  AGPS-IN-2i. L, Immunoblot for AGPS and vinculin in A549 cells in which AGPS was
  knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 with two independent sgRNAs. M, N, Cell death of A549
  sgNTC cells versus sgAGPS #1.1 (M) or sgAGPS #4.1 (N) cells treated with the indicated
  concentrations of RSL3 for 24 h after initial pre-treatment of cells in lipid-depleted
  media for 24 h. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m; n = 3 biologically independent
  replicates. Comparisons were made using two-way ANOVA (E-G, J, K, M, N). *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001'
