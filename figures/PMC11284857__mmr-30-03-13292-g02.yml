figure_title: Disturbance of DFC signaling pathways results in disorders of osteoclast
  differentiation.
caption: 'Disturbance of DFC signaling pathways results in disorders of osteoclast
  differentiation. The depicted regions in this figure are primarily situated within
  the crown dental follicle tissue. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway: Activation of
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway leads to an upregulation of OPG expression, which subsequently
  inhibits osteoclast differentiation. TGF-β signaling pathway: Deficiency of Tgfbr2
  receptor in DFCs inhibits osteoclast differentiation. BMP signaling pathway: Suppression
  of BMP1, TLL1 and Msx2 proteins associated with this pathway inhibit osteoclast
  differentiation. BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; DFC, dental follicle cell; Msx2,
  muscle segment homeobox like 2; OPG, osteoprotegerin; Tgfbr2, TGF-β type 2 receptor'
