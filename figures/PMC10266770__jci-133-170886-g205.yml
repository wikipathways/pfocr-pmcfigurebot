figure_title: STAT2 deficiency and other inborn and acquired defects of type I IFN
  signaling result in susceptibility to viral infections
caption: Inborn errors of immunity affecting molecules important for type I IFN signaling,
  including IFNAR1, IFNAR2, TYK2, JAK1, STAT1, and IRF9, have been previously reported
  to cause phenotypes of severe viral infection. Bucciol, Moens, et al. (1) now report
  on a large series of patients with STAT2 deficiency, indicating that STAT2 loss
  can lead to pronounced complications with viral infections. Type I IFNs, including
  multiple α and β IFNs, signal through the type I IFN receptor, which utilizes the
  JAK/STAT signaling pathway. In addition, acquired autoantibodies against type I
  IFNs have been described in many patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. These
  manifestations indicate that type I IFNs are a critical defense against frequent
  viral exposure. ISG, IFN-stimulated gene; PRR, pattern recognition receptor
