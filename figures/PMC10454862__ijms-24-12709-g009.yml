figure_title: S100A4 activates the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway to promote
  pyroptosis.
caption: S100A4 activates the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway to promote
  pyroptosis. THP-1 macrophages were pre-treated with MCC950 and TPL for 2 h, followed
  by the addition of exogenous S100A4, and then infected with BCG for 24 h. (A–F)
  Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of (B) GSDMD-N, (C) p-NF-κB,
  (D) NLRP3, (E) Caspase-1, and (F) ASC. Data are from mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments, ns p > 0.05, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
