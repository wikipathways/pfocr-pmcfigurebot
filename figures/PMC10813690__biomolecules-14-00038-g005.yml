figure_title: GDF-15 inhibits human platelet AKT and ERK pathways through the GFRAL/RET
  receptor complex.
caption: 'GDF-15 inhibits human platelet AKT and ERK pathways through the GFRAL/RET
  receptor complex. (A) Representative blotting images of AKT and ERK pathways in
  platelets after different treatments. (B) Statistical analysis of the relative expression
  level of P-AKT in platelets after different treatments. (C) Statistical analysis
  of the P-ERK relative expression level in platelets after different treatments.
  ADP treatment: incubated with 5 μM of ADP for 5 min; GDF-15 treatment: 40 ng/mL
  of GDF-15 was used for 15 min before ADP stimulation; BT-13: the RET agonist was
  used, pretreated with 20 μM of BT-13 for 20 min before incubation with GDF-15; SPP-86:
  the RET inhibitor was used, pretreated with 5 μM of SPP-86 for 20 min before incubation
  with GDF-15. *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM, n = 6.
  Original images of (A) can be found in Supplementary Materials'
