figure_title: The Albino phenotype of ‘HJY’ might be modulated by a plastid retrograde
  signaling pathway.
caption: The Albino phenotype of ‘HJY’ might be modulated by a plastid retrograde
  signaling pathway. The albino phenotype of ‘HJY’ grown under natural light might
  be mainly attributed to the abnormal assembly of the thylakoid structure, which
  was induced by the lack of LHCII subunits, especially the Lhcb1. The low level of
  LHCII subunits was due to the suppressed expression of the relevant genes which
  was modulated by the GUN1-PTM-ABI4 pathway. The black arrow (→) indicated the acceleration,
  the black blunt line (┤) indicated the inhibition and other arrows indicated the
  metabolism processing or delivery pathway. 14-3-3, 14-3-3 domain-containing protein;
