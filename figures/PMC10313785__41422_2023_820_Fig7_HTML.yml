figure_title: THBD signaling antagonism attenuates liver fibrosis through senescent
  cell clearance
caption: a Representative THBD staining in healthy (n = 10) and cirrhotic (n = 10)
  human livers. b Representative THBD staining in MCDE (n = 8), CCL4 (n = 5), BDL
  (n = 6) fibrotic murine models. c Representative co-immunohistochemistry staining
  of THBD (red) and p21 (brown) in murine fibrotic models from b. Magnified images
  and arrows signify colocalization between THBD and p21 in hepatocytes. d Protein
  expression of THBD signaling components in hepatocytes isolated from mice on a standard
  chow (n = 4) or MCDE (n = 4) diet. e Schematic diagram of the vorapaxar regimen
  and representative IHC staining of SA-βgal and fibrotic markers (Sirius Red, α-SMA,
  F4/80) following vorapaxar treatment in murine fibrotic models. f Representative
  SA-βgal, fibrotic markers (Sirius Red, α-SMA), and H&E staining of fibrotic livers
  from CCL4 mice treated with 100 mg/kg ABT-263. g Schematic depiction showing that
  THBD ensures senescent cell survival by activating and stabilizing a proteolytic
  feed-forward signaling pathway in early endosomes. THBD signaling inhibition results
  in destabilization and subsequent lysosomal/proteasomal degradation of the multi-protein
  complex, senescent cell death, and restoration of tissue homeostasis during liver
  fibrosis. Scale bars, 50 μm.
