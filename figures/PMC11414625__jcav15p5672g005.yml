caption: Functional analysis of Mast-CCL2 and Mast-IL13 subgroups. (A) Heatmap showing
  the scaled GSVA scores of hallmark gene sets enriched in mast cell subgroups. (B
  and C) GO gene enrichment analysis of Mast-CCL2 and Mast-IL13 subgroups shows that
  their function is related with NF- ÎºB signal pathway. (D) RNA velocity analysis
  showing the transitions of mast cell subgroups
