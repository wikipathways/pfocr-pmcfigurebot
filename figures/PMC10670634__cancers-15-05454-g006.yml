  pathway.
caption: NCBP2 promotes PDAC progression by activating c-JUN/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
  (A) Immunoblotting for protein levels of NCBP2, c-JUN, total/phosphorylated MEK,
  and total/phosphorylated ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) in control and NCBP2-knockdown PDAC
  cells overexpressing c-JUN. Tubulin was used as the internal control. (B) Immunoblotting
  for protein levels of NCBP2, c-JUN, total/phosphorylated MEK, and total/phosphorylated
  ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) in control and NCBP2-overexpression PDAC cells with c-JUN silenced.
  Tubulin was used as the internal control. (C) 3D sphere assays were performed after
  overexpressing c-JUN in control and NCBP2-knockdown PDAC cells. (D) 3D sphere assays
  were performed after c-JUN-knockdown in control and NCBP2-overexpressed PDAC cells,
  * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001
