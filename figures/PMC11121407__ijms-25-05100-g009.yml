figure_title: Regulatory pathway of the tuber expansion in tiger nuts.
caption: Regulatory pathway of the tuber expansion in tiger nuts. The different processes
  occurring during tuber development (cell division and cell enlargement) are represented.
  S1, 40 days after sowing (40 d); S2, 50 d; S3, 60 d; S4, d; S5, 90 d; and S6, 110
  d. The auxin signaling pathway mainly functions during S1–S2; the jasmonic acid
  pathway, brassinosteroid signaling, G-protein pathway, MAPK pathway, and ubiquitin
  protein pathway regulate cell division and the expansion of the tuber cortex and
  stele. Detailed information on these genes is shown in Supplementary Table S4
