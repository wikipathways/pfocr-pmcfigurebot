caption: PFD, AGP, and PFD + AGP inhibited liver fibrosis and inflammation in the
  mice model of BA. (a) Masson's trichrome staining (bar = 100 μm) of collagen in
  liver tissue in different groups. (b) The mRNA levels of α-SMA, collagen I, and
  collagen IV were detected by RT-qPCR. (c) The concentrations of IL-1 β, IL-6, and
  TNF-α in the serum of mice were measured by ELISA.  ∗∗P < 0.01;  ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
