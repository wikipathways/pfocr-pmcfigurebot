figure_title: BCAA catabolism.
caption: BCAA catabolism. (a) Table depicting the fold change ratio of the 3 BCAAs,
  leucine, isoleucine, and valine, and their metabolites after 3 days in space (SPC)
  or ground control (GC). Values in red rectangles represent increased levels of the
  metabolites in space compared to ground control, whereas green rectangles highlight
  the opposite and white rectangles represent no change. (b) Scheme of the BCAA metabolic
  pathways. (c) Example of the levels of 2 metabolites
