figure_title: Biosynthetic pathway of PTs.
caption: Biosynthetic pathway of PTs. In plant cells, the mevalonate and methylerythritol
  phosphate pathways provide isoprene units in the form of isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are used as building blocks
  for the production of squalene. Oxidation of squalene yields 2,3-oxidosqualene,
  which serves as a precursor for the synthesis of all types of PT scaffolds, including
  lupane, ursane, oleanane, and friedelane. For simplicity, enzymes and most synthesis
  steps are omitted
