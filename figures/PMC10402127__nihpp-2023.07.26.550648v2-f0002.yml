figure_title: Impact of WINi on the translatome of MLLr cancer cells
caption: (A) Volcano plots depicting alterations in translation efficiency (TE) induced
  by 48 hour treatment of MV4;11 cells with either 2 μM C6 (left) or 100 nM C16 (right)
  compared to DMSO (n = 2; Red indicates FDR < 0.05 and Log2 FC > 0.25), as determined
  by Ribo-Seq. (B) Number of mRNAs with significantly (FDR < 0.05 and Log2 FC > 0.25)
  altered TE levels following treatment of MV4;11 cells with C6 (2 μM) or C16 (100
  nM) for 48 hours. See Figure 2—source data 1 for complete output of Ribo-Seq analysis.
  (C) Overlap of mRNAs with significantly decreased TE in response to C6- or C16-treatment.
  (D) Translation efficiencies (TE) of mRNAs in DMSO-treated MV4;11 cells plotted
  against translation efficiencies of mRNAs in cells treated with either C6 (left)
  or C16 (right). Red indicates mRNAs with significantly altered translation efficiencies
  following inhibitor treatment (FDR < 0.05 and Log2 FC > 0.25). (E) Numbers of differentially-translated
  mRNAs (ΔTE) in each quartile of genes (stratified by TE in DMSO) in cells treated
  with C6 (left) or C16 (right). (F) Enrichment analysis of common mRNAs suppressed
  by C6/C16 at the mRNA (blue) and translational (red; TE) level in MV4;11 cells.
  Hallmark.MSigDB pathways are shown. The x-axis indicates the number of suppressed
  genes in each category; the italic numbers are the corresponding FDR. See Figure
  2—source data 2 for the full Hallmark.MSigDB analysis, as well as for Reactome and
  KEGG pathways. (G) Enrichment analysis of mRNAs suppressed translationally by C6/C16
  but with no significant changes in mRNA levels. Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process
  (BP) and Molecular Function (MF) categories are shown, as well as KEGG pathways.
  The x-axis displays −Log10 FDR; the number of mRNAs is shown in italics in each
  bar. See Figure 2—source data 3 for extended enrichment analyses, broken down by
  TE and mRNA direction changes. (H) TE changes in WDR5-bound (left) and non-bound
  (right) RPGs elicited by C6 (top) or C16 (bottom)
