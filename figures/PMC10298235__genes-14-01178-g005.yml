figure_title: The ICGC liver cancer cohort validated the study findings.
caption: 'The ICGC liver cancer cohort validated the study findings. (A) Survival
  analysis showed that the overall survival of high-risk patients with a higher PAGscore
  was worse than that of low-risk patients with a lower PAGscore in the ICGC cohort;
  (B) The results of ROC and survival analyses showed that PAGscore performed well
  in predicting the overall survival in liver cancer patients; (C) The relative signaling
  pathway activity in high- and low- risk patients was evaluated by the R package
  “progeny”; (D) The box plots showed that high-risk patients had a higher “ImmuneScore”
  and “StromaScore” and lower “TumorPurity” than low-risk patients; (E) The violin
  plot showed the ssGSEA score of 29 components of TME in high- and low-risk patients.
