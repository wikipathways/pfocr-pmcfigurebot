  The heatmap represents the change in the expression levels of the genes and the
  accumulation levels of the metabolites. From red to blue or to green, the heatmap
  indicates the expression levels of genes or the accumulation levels of metabolites
  ranging from high to low. From left to right, HT, YD, and GD cultivars are shown
