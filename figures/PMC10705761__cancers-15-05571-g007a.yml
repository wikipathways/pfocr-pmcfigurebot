figure_title: Clinical significance of TRIP13 expression in LUAD.
caption: 'Clinical significance of TRIP13 expression in LUAD. (A) Immunohistochemical
  staining of TRIP13. Immunostaining showed that the TRIP13 protein was strongly expressed
  in cancer lesions and less in non-cancerous tissues. Scale bar: 200 µm (low magnification);
  50 µm (high magnification). (B) Forest plot showing the results of multivariate
  Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of the 5-year overall survival rate.
  Patients with high TRIP13 expression had a significantly lower overall survival
  rate. These data were obtained from TCGA-LUAD datasets. (C) Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) was applied to explore molecular pathways mediated by TRIP13 in
  LUAD cells. The top six pathways enriched in LUAD patients with high TRIP13 expression
  were cell cycle, DNA replication, proteasome, P53 signaling pathway, homologous
  recombination, and mismatch repair'
