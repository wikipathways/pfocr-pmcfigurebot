figure_title: Characterization of REV-ERBα-regulated differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs).
caption: 'Characterization of REV-ERBα-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
  (A) Venn diagrams showing the number of RNA species significantly upregulated or
  downregulated in both NR1D1-mutant (N1KO) and NR1D1/2-double-mutant (NDKO) cells
  but showing modest changes (<1.3-fold) in NR1D2-mutant (N2KO) cells. (B) A heat
  map representation for the top 20 upregulated and 20 downregulated genes identified
  as the REV-ERBα-regulated NDKO DEGs. (C,D) Pathway enrichment analyses for the REV-ERBα-dependently
  upregulated (C) and downregulated NDKO DEGs (D). The top significantly enriched
  terms were assessed using gene sets from the “KEGG Pathway” database. Overlapping
  p values and % overlapping for the given pathway term are summarized as color-coded
  bar charts. (E) Top 10 upstream transcriptional factors (TFs) enriched for the upregulated
  REV-ERBα-regulated NDKO DEGs, as suggested by the “TRRUST TFs” gene list in the
  ENRICHR. Overlapping p values and % overlapping for the given transcriptional regulator
  are presented as a color-coded bar chart. (F) Relative expression profiles for the
  representative DEGs constituting the NF-κΒ signaling pathway or suggested as transcriptional
  target genes of the NF-κΒ complex. mRNA expression levels for a given RNA species
  were calculated from the transcripts per million (TPM) values of individual cells
  and expressed as the mean ± SEM of an arbitrary unit (A.U.), in which a mean expression
  level of wild-type (WT) controls is set as 1 (n = 4 for each group; *: p < 0.05
  and **: p < 0.01 vs. WT cells using Student’s t-test)'
