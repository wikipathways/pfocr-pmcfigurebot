figure_title: Schematic diagram of the glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid metabolic
  pathway during the late stages of EHP infection.
caption: 'Schematic diagram of the glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid metabolic pathway
  during the late stages of EHP infection. (a): The glycerophospholipid metabolic
  pathway is shown on the left, (b): The sphingolipid metabolic pathway is shown on
  the right. Red boxes represent up-regulated DEGs, green boxes represent down-regulated
  DEGs, metabolites in yellow boxes are up-regulated SDMs, and metabolites in blue
  boxes are down-regulated SDMs'
