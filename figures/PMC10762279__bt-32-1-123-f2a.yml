figure_title: (A, B) The Kaplan-Meier survival curve represents the overall survival
  (OS) (the patient’s number; low=43, high=134) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (the
  patient’s number; low=21, high=48) of patient with pancreatic cancer according to
  the ACTN4 expression level.
caption: '(A, B) The Kaplan-Meier survival curve represents the overall survival (OS)
  (the patient’s number; low=43, high=134) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (the patient’s
  number; low=21, high=48) of patient with pancreatic cancer according to the ACTN4
  expression level. (C) Effect of piceamycin on ACTN4 mRNA expression. RNA-seq assay
  was performed in gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells treated with piceamycin (1.25
  μM) compared with control (PBS with DMSO-treated). Heatmap shows ACTN4 mRNA expression
  according to z-score. The color represents z-score (yellow; positive score; upregulation,
  blue; negative score; downregulation). / Normalized value of ACTN4 mRNA expression.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD (n=3). (D) Effect of piceamycin on ACTN4 protein
  expression in gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells. Gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells
  were treated with the indicated concentrations of piceamycin for 48 h, and the protein
  expression level of ACTN4 was determined by western blotting. α-Tubulin was used
  as an internal control. (E) Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) for ACTN4 from the
  search tool (STRING) database. Interacting proteins for ACTNB (Actin beta) Gene:
  ACTB (Actin beta)–ACTG1 (Actin gamma1), Interacting proteins for ACTN4 (Actinin
  alpha4) Gene: ACTN4–VCN (Vinculin) (F) Effect of piceamycin on mRNA expression of
  actin polymerization related genes. The heatmap was visualized from the RNA-seq
  data (according to z-score of actin polymerization related genes) and displayed
  on the column (according to z-score; –2≤z≤2, AVE; average of z-score, STD; standard
  deviation of z-score, n=3). / Normalized value (mRNA level) of ACTB and ACTG1 from
  RNA-seq analysis treated with piceamycin (1.25 μM) versus control (PBS with DMSO-treated)
  in gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n=3) (G)
  Modified KEGG pathway of the genes related to actin polymerization signaling pathway.
  Modified KEGG pathway from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) treated
  with piceamycin (1.25 μM) for 48 h compared with control (PBS with DMSO-treated)
  in gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells. The box colors of modified KEGG pathway represent
  fold change. (H) Effect of piceamycin on the proteins related to actin polymerization
  (VCN and ACTB). The protein expression related to actin polymerization biomarkers
  were analyzed by western blotting. Piceamycin was treated on the gemcitabine-resistant
  AsPC-1 cells with indicated concentrations. α-Tubulin was used as an internal control'
