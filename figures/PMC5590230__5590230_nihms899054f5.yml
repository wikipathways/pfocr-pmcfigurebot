figure_title: The cargo of EVs shed from astrocytes in response to IL-1β regulates
  the liver cytokine response through modulation of PPARα
caption: (A) Representative electron micrograph of EVs isolated from astrocytes 2
  hours after stimulation with IL-1β (100 ng/ml). (B) Quantitation of astrocyte-shed
  EV size and quantity. (C) Representative Western blots from astrocyte-shed EVs
  stained for the tetraspan protein CD63 and the lipid raft marker flotillin. (D)
  Venn diagram comparing protein content of EVs constitutively released from
  astrocytes (control) with EVs released 2 hours after stimulation with IL-1β (100
  ng/ml). (E) IPA was conducted using the protein and miRNA content of astrocyte EVs
  shed in response to IL-1β. Red fill indicates negative regulation; green fill
  indicates positive regulation; blue outline shows components identified by the
  protein content of EVs; and a double purple outline shows components targeted by
  multiple miRNAs. (F to I) ChIP assays results of NF-κB binding to (F) Ccl2, (G)
  IL-1β, (H) TNFα, and (I) IL-17 promoter regions in the liver 2 hours after striatal
  injections of saline or IL-1β (0.1 ng in 3 µl). (J and K) Representative
  photomicrographs (J) and stereological quantitation (K) of Ly6b+ leukocytes in the
  striatum 24 hours after striatal injection of saline, IL-1β, or IL-1β + fenofibrate
  (PPARα agonist; 10 mg/kg by tail vein infusion). (L and M) Representative
  photomicrographs (L) and stereological quantitation (M) of Ly6b+ leukocytes 24 hours
  after striatal injection of IL-1β, IL-1β + altenusin (50 µM), or IL-1β + altenusin +
  GW6471 (PPARα antagonist; 20 mg/kg by tail vein infusion). Data are means ± SEM, n =
  3 to 6 mice per condition. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 compared to saline; *P < 0.05
  compared to IL-1β + altenusin; ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001 compared to IL-1β. ANOVA with
  Tukey post hoc comparisons.
