caption: Deciphering metabolic landscapes in GBM(A) Bubble plot depicting the comprehensive
  landscape of altered metabolic programs observed in GBM patients. Each bubble represents
  a specific metabolic program, and its size corresponds to the magnitude of alteration.(B)
  Barplot providing a detailed view of the altered metabolic programs within the specific
  context of GBM2-R1.(C) Correlation analysis conducted to establish the relationships
  between the altered metabolic pathway observed in GBM patients and the MES subtype
  within the GBM2-R1 sample.
