  transcription and protein level.
caption: Evaluation of ORF3a-dependent UPR activation and its executioners at transcription
  and protein level. A549 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of ORF3a (ORF3a group)
  or GFP (GFP group) mRNA (t = 0 h). After 48 h (t = 48 hpt), cells transfected with
  ORF3a mRNA were treated with 1000 nM of GSK2606414 for another 48 h (ttotal = 96
  hpt, ORF3a + GSK414 group). (a) Detection of PERK signaling pathway mediators and
  BH3-only genes; mRNA levels by qPCR in the control, GSK414, ORF3a and GFP groups.
  The expression levels of all target genes were evaluated at 96 hpt and were normalized
  to GAPDH levels. (b,c) Western-blot confirmation of selected UPR-involved and BH3-only
  proteins in the control, GSK414, ORF3a and GFP groups. GAPDH was used as housekeeping
  protein. The relative protein expression levels were calculated at 96 hpt for all
  groups using ImageJ by measuring band intensities in different (n = 3) blots and
  are represented in bar charts as mean ± SD. The relative protein expression of all
  target proteins is normalized to GAPDH levels Asterisks (*), (**), and (***) indicate
  statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01, and p ≤ 0.001, respectively)
  compared to control cells, while “ns” indicates non-significant differences
