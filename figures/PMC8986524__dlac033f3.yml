caption: 'Genes encoding components of membrane trafficking pathways mutated in the
  msh2Δ antifungal drug-resistant strains. Schematic of the membrane trafficking pathways
  in a fungal cell (adapted from Feyder et al.) showing the role of proteins encoded
  by genes mutated in the msh2Δ antifungal drug-resistant strains (black text). Transporting
  newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi requires
  formation of COPII vesicles (involves Sec23) and the fusion of vesicles tethered
  to the Golgi membrane that is dependent on the GTPase Ypt1 and Trs130, a component
  of the transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex, which acts as a multimeric guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor for Ypt1 (brown arrow). Snx3 is a late-Golgi sorting
  nexin and Kes1 is required for negative regulation of Golgi secretory functions.
  Secretion from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (pink arrow) requires the exocyst
  complex, containing Sec8, to tether post-Golgi secretory vesicles to sites of exocytosis.
  There are two pathways from the Golgi to the vacuole: the direct ALP pathway (dark
  blue arrow) and the indirect VPS pathway via endosomes (light blue arrow). In the
  ALP pathway (dark blue arrow), ALP is packaged into vesicles through the AP-3 adapter
  complex, containing Apl6 and Apl3, which also recruits clathrin. In the VPS pathway
  (light blue arrow), soluble carboxypeptidase Y pro-protease (CPY) binds to its receptor
  Vps10 in the Golgi lumen and is transported from the trans-Golgi network via AP-1
  adapter and clathrin-coated vesicles to endosomes. The Rab GTPase Vps21 and guanine
  exchange factor for Rab GTPases Vps9 are required for Golgi-endosome trafficking.
  Vps16 and Vps39 are part of the HOPS complex essential for docking and fusion of
  vesicles. Fusion of the late endosome (multivesicular body, MVB) to the vacuole
  also requires the HOPS complex. In the late endosome, proteins are sorted into vesicles
  that bud into the lumen in a process that requires the ESCRT complexes containing
  Hse1 (ESCRT-0) and Snf7 (ESCRT-III). The endocytic pathway (red) and retrograde
  transport (green dashed arrows) are also indicated.'
