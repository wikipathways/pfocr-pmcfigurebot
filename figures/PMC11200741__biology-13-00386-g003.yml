figure_title: Outline of the Hippo signalling pathway.
caption: 'Outline of the Hippo signalling pathway. (A) The Hippo signalling pathway
  is considered in the “ON” state when MTS1/2 is phosphorylated and binds to the respective
  SAV1 C-domain. This allows a heterodimer to be formed, causing consecutive phosphorylation
  of MOB1 and LATS1/2 kinases. This results in YAP/TAZ being phosphorylated and recruiting
  the 14-3-3 protein, causing either cytoplasmic retention or proteolytic degradation.
  Thus, TEAD ultimately inhibits the transcription of target genes associated with
  cell proliferation, survival, and migration (perceived in red X). (B) The Hippo
  signalling pathway is in the “OFF” state when no phosphorylation of MTS1/2, SAV1-C
  domain, MOB1, and LATS1/2 kinases occurs. Therefore, YAP/TAZ is not phosphorylated
  and is localized to the nucleus, where it binds and forms a complex with TEAD to
  stimulate transcription of target genes such as: c-MYC, CYR61, and CTGF (perceived
  as black arrow). This figure is an illustration21 by Haddad et al. and has not been
  published elsewhere'
