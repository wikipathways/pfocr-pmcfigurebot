figure_title: Moco biosynthesis pathway in eukaryotes.
caption: Moco biosynthesis pathway in eukaryotes. The pathway is divided into four
  distinct stages. During step 1, the C8 atom of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), marked
  with a star, is incorporated by the cPMP synthase between the 2′ and 3′ carbon atoms
  of ribose, forming the new C1’ position in the pterin’s four-carbon side chain,
  which is similarly starred in cPMP. In the second step, a dithiolene motif is inserted
  by the MPT synthase. Steps three and four are catalyzed by specific domains of the
  Mo-insertase in which the G-domain adenylates MPT, and then molybdate is inserted
  by the E-domain
