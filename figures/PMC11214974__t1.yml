caption: 'The influence of different concentrations of LPS and GA on Caco-2 cell viabilityAfter
  different concentrations of LPS were added to 96-well plates and coincubated with
  Caco-2 cells for (A) 4 h and (B) 24 h, the cell viability of the respective groups
  was inspected by a CCK-8 assay. Cell viability was assayed after Caco-2 cells were
  cultivated with GA at different concentrations for (C) 24 h and (D) 48 h. Data are
  presented as the mean±SEM of 6 separate experiments. Significant differences were
  found between means with different letters as determined by one-way ANOVA, n=6;
  *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 compared to the control. GA: gallic acid.'

  suppressing the activation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway.
