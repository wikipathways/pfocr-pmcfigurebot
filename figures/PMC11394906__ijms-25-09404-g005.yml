caption: 'Schematic representation of the hormonal signaling pathways involved in
  stress tolerance and plant growth regulation in rice. (A) The ABA (abscisic acid)
  signaling pathway: ABA binds to its receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR), which inhibits PP2C
  phosphatases, allowing the activation of SnRK2 kinases. Activated SnRK2 then phosphorylates
  and activates the ABF/AREB transcription factors, which regulate the expression
  of stress-responsive genes, enhancing stress tolerance. (B) The GA (gibberellin)
  signaling pathway: Gibberellin (GA) binds to its receptor GID1, leading to the degradation
  of DELLA proteins via the 26S proteasome pathway. The degradation of DELLA releases
  its inhibitory effect on plant growth, thereby promoting growth and also indirectly
  contributing to enhanced stress tolerance'
