number: Figure 3
figure_title: GO and KEGG analysis.
caption: GO and KEGG analysis. (A) GO functional classification map for target genes
  of DE tRFs. (B) Top 30 GO terms for target gene enrichment analysis. (C) KEGG pathway
  classification map for target genes of DE tRFs. (D) Top 30 terms from the KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis. A larger Rich Factor indicates a greater enrichment. The q-value
  is the P-value after correction for multiple hypothesis testing and a smaller value
  indicates more significant enrichment. A larger area of the graph indicates a greater
  number of genes. (E) Signaling pathway regulation network for predicted target genes.
  GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; tRF, transfer
