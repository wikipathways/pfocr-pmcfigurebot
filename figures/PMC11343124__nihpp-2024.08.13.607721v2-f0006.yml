figure_title: B. burgdorferi-induced IFN-β is dependent on the STING signaling pathway
caption: 'RAW264.7 or STING KO macrophages treated with STING inhibitor H-151 (100
  ng/ml) or TBK1 inhibitor BX795 (100 ng/ml), were infected with wild-type (WT) B.
  burgdorferi 5A4NP1 at an MOI of 10 (A). As controls, cells were treated with poly
  I: C (B). After 24 hours, supernatants and macrophage were collected. The IFN-β
  protein levels were measured in supernatants (A and B, top panel) and Ifnb1 RNA
  levels were measured in macrophages and represented as relative to mock-treated
  (A and B, lower panel). The data represent the mean ± SD of at least three experiments
  (n = 3). Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA, with **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001'
