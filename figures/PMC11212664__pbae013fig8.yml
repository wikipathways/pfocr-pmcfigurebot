caption: Schematic diagram depicting gut dysbiosis and stimulation of the NLR signaling
  pathway after MyD88 suppression in intestinal inflammation. In normal conditions,
  the extracellular and intracellular PPRs (TLRs and NLRs) sense intestinal microbiota
  through PAMPs and exert anti-bacterial effects. In the state of intestinal inflammation,
  although MyD88 suppression can restrict the MyD88-mediated activation of NF-ÎºB,
  it also leads to unfavorable changes in the composition of gut microbiota and induces
  the upregulation of the NLR signaling pathway. Eliminating gut microbiota with antibiotics
  or blocking NLR signal transduction with NLR inhibitor in combination with MyD88
  suppression can ameliorate the inflammatory response.
article_title: Suppression of MyD88 disturbs gut microbiota and activates the NLR
  pathway and hence fails to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis.
