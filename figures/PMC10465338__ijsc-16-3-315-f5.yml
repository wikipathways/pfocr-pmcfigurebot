figure_title: cAMP/PKA signaling pathway is involved in regulating the proliferation
  effect of PTHrP in patient-derived GSCs.
caption: 'cAMP/PKA signaling pathway is involved in regulating the proliferation effect
  of PTHrP in patient-derived GSCs. Three patient-derived GSCs (GSC-01, GSC-02, and
  GSC-03) were transfected with siNC or siPTHrP. The siPTHrP cells were randomly allocated
  into two groups. One group was treated with 10 μM forskolin, the other just add
  an equal volume of the medium. (A) After culturing for three days, cell proliferation
  was analyzed using BrdU incorporation. Scale bar=100 μm. (B) The value represents
  the mean±standard deviation of three independent experiments (n=3). *p<0.05 versus
  siNC group; ###p<0.001 versus siPTHrP group. (C) The illustration depicts the mechanism
  that PTHrP regulates the proliferation of patient-derived GSCs. PTHrP is secreted
  by GSCs to the extracellular environment. A high level of PTHrP significantly increases
  cAMP concentration via autocrine or paracrine routes. The PKA is activated due to
  a high level of cAMP, eventually promoting the proliferation of patient-derived
  GSCs. PTHR1: parathyroid hormone 1 receptor, PTHR2: parathyroid hormone 2 receptor,
  AC: adenylyl cyclase'
