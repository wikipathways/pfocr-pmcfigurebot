  kinases (MAPKKKs), which phosphorylate MAPKK and, subsequently, MAPK.
caption: ROS-induced oxidation of free thiol groups activates MAP kinase kinase kinases
  (MAPKKKs), which phosphorylate MAPKK and, subsequently, MAPK. This signaling pathway
  is further amplified by the oxidation of MAPK phosphatases, which are inhibited
  by oxidation of a thiol residue in their active site, resulting in full activation
  of the MAPK cascade. OX = oxidation, P = phosphorylation. The figure was created
