figure_title: Ltf attenuates cardiac fibrosis via interacting with CD74 to inhibit
  mTORC1/S6K/eIF-4B signaling pathway.
caption: Ltf attenuates cardiac fibrosis via interacting with CD74 to inhibit mTORC1/S6K/eIF-4B
  signaling pathway. A. Schematic overview of phosphoproteomics. B. PLS-DA analysis
  of phosphoproteomic profiling between CTR MI and Ltf MI group. C. Volcano plots
  analysis of phosphopeptides. D. GSEA analysis via Reactome database. E. Enriched
  GO terms by molecular function. Area represents enrichments. F. Primary biological
  processes in the DMPs. The clusters are referred to biological process terms. Each
  dot represents a single DMP. G. Signaling pathway classification according to KEGG
  terms. H. Cytoscape analysis of protein-protein interactions network. The top 20
  defined by cytoHubba were shown. I. Ingenuity pathway analysis of DMPs. J. Representative
  Western blot images (left) and quantitative analysis (right) of indicated proteins.
  n = 6/ea. K-L. Cellular co-immunoprecipitation assays of Ltf and CD74. Cell lysates
  were immunoprecipitated with antibody against CD74, immunoblot with Ltf antibody
  (K) and vice versa (L). M. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of rLtf and rCD74 in
  a cell-free system. N. Immunofluorescence co-localization of Ltf and CD74 in fibroblasts.
  Data are presented as mean Â± SEM, by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc
  test, ***P < 0.001 compared with corresponding group
