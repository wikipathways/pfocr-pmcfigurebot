  LincRNA-p21/β-catenin signaling pathway related to the cell senescence by MPP+-induced cell senescence. Note: (A and B) Western blotting analysis the expression level of β-catenin protein (n=3; * represents MPP+
  vs. Control; # represents MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21 vs. MPP+). (C) RT-qPCR analyzed the expression level of β-catenin mRNA (n=3; * represents siRNA-β-catenin vs. Control). (D) MTT assay determined the viability at different times (n=3; * represents MPP+
  vs. Control; # represents MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21 vs. MPP+; & represents MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21+ siRNA-β-catenin vs. MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21). (E) LDH release assessment for cell viability (n=3; * represents MPP+
  vs. Control; # represents MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21 vs. MPP+; & represents MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21+ siRNA-β-catenin vs. MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21). (F-H) RT-qPCR analyses levels of senescence-associated makers such as genes p53 and p16, as well as the telomere length (n=3; * represents MPP+
  vs. Control; # represents MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21 vs. MPP+; & represents MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21+ siRNA-β-catenin vs. MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21). (I) Relative telomerase activity (n=3; * represents MPP+
  vs. Control; # represents MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21 vs. MPP+; & represents MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21+ siRNA-β-catenin vs. MPP+ + siRNA-lincRNA-p21)
