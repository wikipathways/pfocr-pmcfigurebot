figure_title: Interaction of macrophages with trophoblast cells.
caption: Interaction of macrophages with trophoblast cells. (A) The overall information
  flow of significant signaling pathways in macrophages in NC and RM groups. The signaling
  pathways colored red are enriched in NC group, and those colored blue are enriched
  in RM group. (B) Statistical plot showing the number and strength of significant
  signaling pathways in macrophages in NC and RM groups. (C) Circle plot showing the
  differential number of interactions in macrophages between NC and RM groups. The
  thicker the line represented, the more the number of interactions between the two
  cell types. (D) Circle plot showing the differential interaction strength in macrophages
  between NC and RM groups. The thicker the line represented, the stronger the interaction
  weights/strength between the two cell types. (E) Violin plot showing the expression
  patterns of signaling genes involved in the HGF signaling pathway network. Normalized
  expression levels are shown in the violin plot. Red represents the NC group and
  blue represents the RM group. (F) Circle plot showing the HGF signaling pathway
  network in cells from maternal-fetal interface in NC and RM groups. The thicker
  the line represented, the stronger the interaction weights/strength between the
  two cell types. (G) Comparison of the contributions of ligand-receptor pairs in
  the HGF signaling pathway network between NC and RM groups. (H) Violin plot showing
  the expression patterns of signaling genes involved in the IL1 signaling pathway
  network. Normalized expression levels are shown in the violin plot. Red represents
  the NC group and blue represents the RM group. (I) Circle plot showing the IL1 signaling
  pathway network in cells from maternal-fetal interface in NC and RM groups. The
  thicker the line represented, the stronger the interaction weights/strength between
  the two cell types. (J) Comparison of the contributions of ligand-receptor pairs
  in the IL1 signaling pathway network between NC and RM groups
