caption: Response of the phytohormone signaling pathway to UV-B radiation in R. chrysanthum.
  (A) Heatmaps depict transcript expression profiles associated with phytohormone
  signaling pathways under UV-B irradiation. A pink box indicates a gene that is upregulated,
  while a white box indicates a gene that is downregulated; (B) ABA signaling pathway
  transcript expression profile. An orange box represents genes that have been upregulated,
  while a green box represents genes that have been downregulated. (The value is the
  log2 fold change (log2(FC)) of each gene.)
