caption: Assessment of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling inhibition
  by exosomes from retinal organoids (Exo-ROs) in vivo. (A) Reverse transcription-quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction analysis identifies the key gene expressions of the MAPK
  pathway, including those of MAP24, MAPK1, MAPK8, MAPK10, c-FOS, and c-JUN. These
  genes are significantly lower in the Exo-RO-treated retinas than those in control
  and vesicle-treated retinas. (B) Quantitative analysis of band density. Each experiment
  is executed in triplicate. Data are shown as mean Â± standard error (n = 3). (C)
  The expression of phosphorylated MAPK family members is assessed by Western blotting
  after treatment with Exo-ROs. The expression of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase (p-JNK)/JNK and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK)/ERK
  is significantly decreased in Exo-RO-treated retinas compared to control and vehicle-treated
  retinas (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, by one-way analysis of variance)
