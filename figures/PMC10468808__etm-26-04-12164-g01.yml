figure_title: Activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways regulates the expression
  of catabolic factors.
caption: Activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways regulates the expression
  of catabolic factors. External signals activate TRAF2/TRAF6, and induce the phosphorylation
  of MAPK (JNK, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2) by mediating TAK1. The phosphorylation of IKKα/IKKβ
  is induced by TAK1 and external signals. The IKK-induced phosphorylation of IκBα
  may lead to its degradation and the release of p65/p50, which enter the nucleus
  for the transcriptional regulation of target genes, including IL-1β, TNFα, COX-2,
  iNOS, MMPs and ADAMTSs. Ginsenosides may inhibit NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways,
  and suppress inflammatory responses. TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; TAK,
  transforming growth factor-β activated kinase; IKK, inhibitor of IκB kinase; COX,
  cyclooxygenase; iNOS, inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase; ADAMTSs, A disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase 1
