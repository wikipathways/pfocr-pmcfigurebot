caption: PFD, AGP, and PFD + AGP attenuated the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3
  in activated LX-2 cells in the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. (a) and (c) The protein
  expression of p-Smad2, Smad2, p-Smad3, Smad3, and TGF-β1 were detected by Western
  blot. (b) The quantification of p-Smad2, Smad2, p-Smad3, and Smad3 protein expressions
  were measured by densitometry analysis. (d) The ratio of p-Smad2/Smad2, p-Smad3/Smad3,
  and TGF-β1/β-actin were measured by densitometry analysis. (e) The mRNA levels of
  α-SMA, collagen I, and TGF-β1 were detected by RT-qPCR. (f) The levels of IL-1 β,
  IL-6, and TNF-α in treated LX-2 cells were measured by ELISA.  ∗P < 0.05;  ∗∗P <
  0.01;  ∗∗∗P < 0.001.
