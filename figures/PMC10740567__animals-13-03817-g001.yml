  protozoa.
caption: Signaling pathways involved in the inhibition of apoptosis by Apicomplexan
  protozoa. Schematic representation of the proposed apoptosis inhibition mechanisms
  of Apicomplexan protozoa in host cells. In this model, Apicomplexan protozoa inhibit
  EGFR, Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 phosphorylation (proapoptotic mechanisms)
  signaling pathway, while activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (antiapoptotic
  mechanisms). FADD, Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain; TRADD, TNF
  receptor-associated death domain; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; MMP, mitochondrial
  membrane potential; APAF-1, apoptotic protease activating factor-1; GPCR, G protein-coupled
  receptor
