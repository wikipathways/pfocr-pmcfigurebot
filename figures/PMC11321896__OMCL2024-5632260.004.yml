caption: Correlation of mRNA expression of 10 random DEG sequences of anti-inflammatory
  factors in NF-κB pathway using RNA-seq and RT-qPCR. The three diagrams shown the
  results of comparing Q250, Q500, and Q750 with Con. Black represented the RNA-seq
  result, and gray represented the RT-qPCR result. Con represented control; Q250 represented
  250 mg/kg quercetin treatment; Q500 represented 500 mg/kg quercetin treatment; and
  Q750 represented 750 mg/kg quercetin treatment
