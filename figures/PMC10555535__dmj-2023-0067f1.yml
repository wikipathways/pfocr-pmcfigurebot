figure_title: Metabolic pathway of exogenous and endogenous lipoproteins.
caption: Metabolic pathway of exogenous and endogenous lipoproteins. The exogenous
  pathway involves trafficking of dietary lipids to peripheral organs, and ultimately
  to the liver. Long chain fatty acids derived from hydrolyzed dietary lipids are
  transformed to triglyceride (TG) in lymphatic endothelial cells, and are packaged
  with, apolipoprotein B-48 (ApoB-48) as well as apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein
  C (ApoC) to form chylomicrons. Chylomicrons secreted into intestinal lymphatic circulation
  reach systemic circulation via thoracic duct. Chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein
  lipase (LPL) that is anchored on the surface of capillary endothelium in adipose
  tissue, and heart and skeletal muscles to release free fatty acids (FFAs), and shrink
  to chylomicron remnants. Chylomicron remnants bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor
  (LDLR) thorough ApoE-mediated mechanism, and are rapidly cleared from the circulation.
  The endogenous pathway delivers hepatically derived lipoproteins to the periphery,
  providing energy source during fasting. Hepatocytes esterify fatty acids to form
  TG, which are packaged into very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles with apoB-100.
  Circulating VLDL particles are hydrolyzed by LPL to release FFAs, and are referred
  to as intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). About 50% of IDL particles are removed
  by hepatocytes via ApoE-mediated binding to LDLR. The remainder of IDL particles
  are further processed by hepatic lipase (HL) to form low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
  particles. LDL particles may be removed from the circulation by hepatocytes via
  apoB-100-mediated binding to LDLR, or may serve as a source of cholesterol deposit
  in the peripheral tissue, triggering a subsequent atherosclerotic process
