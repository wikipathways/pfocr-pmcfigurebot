caption: (A) Schematic diagram of the mechanism of ferroptosis in DSS-induced human
  Caco-2 cells through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Effects of different treatments on oxidative
  stress in DSS-induced Caco-2 cells. Content of (B) SOD, (C) MDA, (D) free iron,
  and (E) GSH/GSSG ratio in DSS-induced Caco-2 cells. a, b, c, and d indicate significant
  differences (p < 0.05). The groups containing differently labeled letters indicate
  significant differences (p < 0.05). The groups with the same letter labeled exhibit
  no significant differences
