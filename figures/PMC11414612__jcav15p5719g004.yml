figure_title: ABL2 expression affected TGF-β/SMAD2/3 and YAP signaling pathway related
  proteins.
caption: ABL2 expression affected TGF-β/SMAD2/3 and YAP signaling pathway related
  proteins. (A and B) Left, Representative image shown the expression of TGF-β1 and
  YAP signaling pathway related proteins in MGC-803cells (A) and HGC-27 cells (B)
  with knocked down or overexpressed ABL2 expression. Right, Quantitative analysis
  of the relative protein expression levels. (C) Left, Representative image of cell
  fluorescence showing that knockdown of ABL2 in MGC-803 cells decreases YAP expression
  and increases p-YAP expression (scale bars = 100 μm). Right, Quantitative analysis
  of the mean fluorescent intensity levels. (D) Left, Representative image of cell
  fluorescence indicating that knockdown of ABL2 in MGC-803 cells decreases p-SMAD2/3
  expression (scale bars = 100 μm). Right, Quantitative analysis of the mean fluorescent
  intensity levels. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments.
