figure_title: Disease-associated gene modules in excitatory neurons using co-expression
  networks derived from AD-dysregulated gene programs
caption: (a—c). UMAP plot of the topological overlap matrix (TOM) illustrating neuronal
  co-expression networks constructed from genes programs comprising dysregulated pathways
  in excitatory neurons in the (a) MTG, (b) SFG, and (c) ETC. Nodes represent genes,
  color-coded by module membership, linked by edges depicting co-expression strength,
  with node size reflecting gene eigengene-based connectivity (). Top hub genes are
  annotated within each module, with bold labels and directional arrows indicating
  hub-DEGs (hDEGs) as up- or down-regulated. Network visualization is simplified by
  edge downsampling for clarity. (d—i). Gene overlap analysis showing overlap of DEGs
  (d, f, h) and AD-associated genes () (e, g, i) with genes within co-expression modules,
  using Fisher’s exact test. An “X” indicates nonsignificant overlap (FDR > 0.05).
  (j—l). Lollipop plots representing the fold-change of differential expression for
  Module Eigengenes (DMEs), with the dot size corresponding to the number of genes
  in the respective module. An “X” overlays modules without statistically significant
  expression changes (FDR > 0.05). (m—o). Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment within
  differentially expressed co-expression modules. Bar plots illustrate the log-scaled
  enrichment scores; blue arrows indicate downregulated, and red arrows indicate upregulated
  processes.
