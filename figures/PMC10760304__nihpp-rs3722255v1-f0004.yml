figure_title: Validating the hToC as a Peritendinous Fibrosis Model
caption: Volcano plots summarizing differential expression comparisons using DESeq2
  of a, TGF-β1 treated versus untreated hToC, b, TGF-β1 treated hToC versus healthy
  human flexor tendon, and c, human tenolysis tissue versus healthy human flexor tendon.
  d, Dotplot graph identifies overlapping Reactome pathways, which are significantly
  enriched in the three comparisons, e, Dissimilarity matrix of Reactome pathways
  enriched in TGF-β1 treated hToC and Human tenolysis tissue relative to healthy human
  tendon. f, GSEA enrichment plots for Reactome MTOR Signaling Pathway in tenolysis
  tissue and TGF-b1 treated hToC. All DEG were based on Padj < 0.05 and abs(Log2(FC))
  > 1. N = 3 hToC devices per condition representing three biological replicates
