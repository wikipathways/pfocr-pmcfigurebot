  pathway in SHR-2VO rats.
caption: 'Effects of W1302 on the expression of inflammatory factors and the NF-κB
  pathway in SHR-2VO rats. SHR-2VO rats: permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid
  arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats; WKY rats: age-matched Wistar Kyoto
  rats as non-hypertensive sham-operated control. Quantitative analysis of TNF-α (A,B)
  and IL-1β (C,D) levels by Elisa kits (n = 8). (E) Representative bands of Western
  blot and quantitative analysis of NF-κB phosphorylation level and NF-κB expression
  (n = 6). (F) Representative bands of Western blot and quantitative analysis of IκBα
  phosphorylation level and IκBα expression (n = 6). Data were expressed as mean ±
  S.E.M. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 vs. WKY rats and * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, vs. SHR-2VO
  rats'
