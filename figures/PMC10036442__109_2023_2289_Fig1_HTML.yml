caption: 'Gut host-microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites activate AhR signaling
  in the brain via different pathways and induce pathological changes observed in
  AD pathology. Microbial bacteria secrete indole molecules which via circulation
  can activate AhR signaling in the brain. Liver and kidney process the secreted indole
  molecules into uremic toxins, e.g., indole sulfate. Uremic toxins accumulate in
  the blood during chronic kidney disease. There is a close interplay between the
  microbiota and the host cells of the gastrointestinal tract, stimulating the generation
  of serotonin by enterochromaffin cells. Some microbes can convert tryptophan into
  tryptamine which activates AhR signaling. Gut host-microbiota interplay, e.g., in
  inflammation, activates the IDO1/TDO-induced KYN pathway which generates novel agonists
  for the Ah receptor. Subsequently, AhR signaling stimulates the expression of IDO1
  enzyme inducing a positive feedback loop. Below, the pathological effects induced
  by AhR signaling are listed, many of which are also observed in AD pathology (see
  the text). Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer’s disease; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor;
  BBB, blood–brain barrier; IDO1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, KYN, kynurenine; TDO,
  tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase'
