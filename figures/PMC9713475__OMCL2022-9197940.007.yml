caption: 'Interactions between macrophage infiltrated in the injured area and macrophage/microglia.
  7 days after SCI, most of the locally infiltrated macrophages/microglia express
  the M1 phenotype and secrete a large number of proinflammatory factors such as IL-1β,
  which aggravate the local inflammation of the injury. In recent works, we found
  that macrophages infiltrated in the spinal cord injured area can release Met. It
  may be a key factor in the M1 polarization of macrophage/microglia. This happens
  through LL37 triggering downstream NF-κB proinflammatory pathway via the activation
  of the P2X7R. However, limiting the number of Mets by using DNase I can promote
  the M2 polarization of macrophage/microglia and the release of anti-inflammatory
  factors such as IL-10. Therefore, Mets can be a new target for the treatment of
  SCI. SCI: spinal cord injury; IL: interleukin. Met: macrophage extracellular trap.
  P2X7R: P2X purinoreceptor 7.'
