caption: Ceramide synthase 1 (CERS1) is the limiting enzyme of S1P de novo synthesis
  in female SCC patients. (A) S1P biosynthetic pathway. (B) Data from RNAseq database
  TCGA_LUSC_2016 showed that CERS1 was equally expressed in non-cancerous tissues
  of male (n = 37) and female (n = 14) patients, while it was reduced in the cancerous
  lung tissues of female (n = 130), compared to male (n = 371) SCC patients (C). A
  comparative analysis of transcripts with default parameters was performed using
  the Lung Cancer Explorer (LCE) tool
