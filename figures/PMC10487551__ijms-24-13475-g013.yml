caption: 'Amino acid (AA) synthesis pathway and gene expression in Dikemai1 (D) and
  Yunmai 0606 (Y) grains at two phenological maturation stages: waxy grain (WG) and
  mature grain (MG). (A) Heatmap showing expression patterns of major genes related
  to AA synthesis between WG and MG of D and Y. (B) Heatmap showing relative expression
  levels of the primary AACs between the four groups. Red indicates a high relative
  level of expression, while green indicates a low relative level of expression. Essential
  AAs are marked with an “@” symbol. (C) Relationships between major genes encoding
  enzymes involved in the AA synthesis pathway. Essential AAs are highlighted in purple.
  (D) A heatmap of the expression patterns of all differentially expressed genes between
  WG and MG of D and Y that were shown to be involved in the AA metabolism pathway
  by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database analysis. Red indicates
  high gene expression, while blue indicates low gene expression. AAT: aspartate aminotransferase;
