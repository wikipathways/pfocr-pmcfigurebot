figure_title: GO and KEGG classification of all DEGs.
caption: GO and KEGG classification of all DEGs. (A) The x-axis is the GO classification
  and the y-axis is the number of genes, (B) the y-axis (left) is the name of KEGG
  secondary metabolic pathway, the y-axis (right) is the name of KEGG primary metabolic
  pathway, and the x-axis is the number of genes annotated to this pathway and their
  proportion to the total number of annotated genes
