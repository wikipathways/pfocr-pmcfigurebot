caption: MLPH promotes EMT in PAAD cells through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. (A,
  B) KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis by KEGG based on TCGA database. (C, D) Relative
  protein levels of MLPH, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, p-Akt, and Akt in cells
  after treatment with or without 740Y-P and the quantitative statistics of protein
  expression. (*P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01). (E, F) Relative protein levels of MLPH, E-cadherin,
  N-cadherin, Vimentin, p-Akt, and Akt in cells after treatment with or without LY294002
  and the quantitative statistics of protein expression. (*P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01)
