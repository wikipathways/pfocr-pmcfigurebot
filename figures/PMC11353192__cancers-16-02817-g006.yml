caption: Knockdown of HCAR1 or its key associated proteins involved in RAS or PI3K
  signaling interrupted lactate-stimulated activation of the two pathways. Subconfluent
  MDA-MB-231 cells were knocked down for the indicated proteins with small interfering
  RNA (siRNA) and treated with 10 mM lactate for 24 h, followed by total protein extraction
  and Western blot detection for protein expression changes. Scr, scrambled RNA as
  non-target control. Two different siRNAs for each target gene were used in the experiment
