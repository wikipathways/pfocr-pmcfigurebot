figure_title: The effects of royal jelly (RJ) and its components on bone mineral density
  and strength.
caption: 'The effects of royal jelly (RJ) and its components on bone mineral density
  and strength. The key mechanisms of RJ action are based on increasing the antioxidant
  capacity, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating the production of inflammatory
  mediators, estrogenic activity, and interaction of 10-HDA with FFAR4 receptor. RJ
  and its components, such as 10-HDA, have an inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation
  and function by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway and its downstream molecules
  including NFATc1, CtsK, TRAP, V-ATPase D2, and MMP9, via FFAR4. Moreover, the inhibitory
  effect of RJ on ROS reduces RANKL, TRAP, NF-B, and caspase-3 activities in osteoclasts.
  RJ upregulates Runx2, Wnt, TGF-β, Osterix, Osteocalcin, and ALP by inhibiting accumulation
  of ROS. This contributes to the increased bone formation/mineralization and decreased
  bone resorption, resulting in increased bone mass, bone mineral density, and bone
  strength, and decreased risk of bone fractures. Note: 10-HDA, 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic
  acid; BMD, bone mineral density; CTX, C-terminal telopeptide; FFAR4, free fatty
  acid receptor 4; IL-1β, interleukin 1 beta; LPS, lpopolysaccharide; RANK, receptor
  activator of nuclear factor-κB; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-kB ligand; RUNX2,
  runt-related transcription factor 2; NFAT c1, nuclear factor of activated T cell;
  MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase 9; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; OPG, osteoprotegerin;
  Osx, Osterix, transcription factor; TGF-β, transforming growth factor;TNF-α, tumor
  necrosis factor alpha. ↑ upregulated; ↓ downregulated'
