figure_title: Effect of SRP on the renal inflammatory reaction.
caption: 'Effect of SRP on the renal inflammatory reaction. (A) TNF-α, (B) IL-1β,
  and (C) IL-6 levels. (D) Protein expression related to the inflammatory pathway
  in kidney tissue. (E) Protein expression of inflammatory pathway components, quantified
  by densitometry and normalized to β-actin. Significant differences are indicated
  as follows: “#” indicates that the values are significantly different from the control
  group (p < 0.05); “##” indicates that the values are significantly different from
  the control group (p < 0.001); “###” indicates that the values are significantly
  different from the control group (p < 0.01); “*” indicates that the values are significantly
  different from the Cd-AKI group (p < 0.05); “**” indicates that the values are significantly
  different from the Cd-AKI group (p < 0.01); “***” indicates that the values are
  significantly different from the Cd-AKI group (p < 0.001); “ns” indicates no significant
  difference'
