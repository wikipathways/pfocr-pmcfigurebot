caption: '(A) Number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in comparison groups
  DCT vs. DTS and ZCT vs. ZTS. (B) Venn diagrams depict the differentially expressed
  and co-expressed DEGs in response to low temperature in DMY1 and ZD958 radicles.
  (C) Top 20 GO term analysis for the DCT vs. DTS comparison group. (E) Top 20 GO
  term analysis for the ZCT vs. ZTS comparison group. There are three main categories
  of Gene Ontology (GO) terms: biological process, molecular function, and cellular
  component. (D) The Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway for comparison
  group DCT vs. DTS. (F) KEGG pathway for comparison group ZCT vs. ZTS. DCT: control
  treatment of DMY1; DTS: low-temperature treatment of DMY1; ZCT: control treatment
  of ZD958; ZTS: low-temperature treatment of ZD958'
