figure_title: Oxidative pathways and oxidoreductases are overrepresented in the published
  metabolic enzyme phosphoproteome
caption: (A) Workflow depicting structural annotation of phoshosites on PDB structures.
  (B) Pie chart representing that the majority of metabolic enzymes are phosphorylated
  as annotated by cross-referencing proteins curated from KEGG and published phosphosites
  in PSP. (C) Gene level pathway enrichment analysis of phosphorylated metabolic enzymes
  performed using Reactome gene set and Enrichr analysis tool. Data is represented
  as Manhattan plot for enrichment terms and p-values from Fisher’s exact test was
  adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. (D) Molecular function enrichment analysis
  using GO Molecular Function gene set and Enrichr plotted by ranked GO terms illustrating
  that NAD/NADP cycling oxidoreductases are overrepresented in the published metabolic
  enzyme phosphoproteome, and Fisher’s exact test p-values were adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg
  procedure
