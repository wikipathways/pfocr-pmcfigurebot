figure_title: Canonical pathways perturbed in the lungs of MWCNT-treated rats.
caption: Canonical pathways perturbed in the lungs of MWCNT-treated rats. (A) Venn
  diagram showing the number of significantly perturbed canonical pathways in the
  MWCNT-treated group compared to time-matched controls at each time point. (B) Canonical
  pathways perturbed at all three time points. Among the 88 pathways, the top 10 (if
  applicable) pathways are arranged according to the mean −log10 (p-value) of the
  three time points with respect to positively regulated pathways, negatively regulated
  pathways, and pathways with no activity pattern available. (C) Canonical pathways
  exclusively perturbed at Year 0.5. All 16 pathways are listed. Positively and negatively
  regulated pathways are arranged according to the z-score. Pathways with no activity
  pattern available are arranged according to the −log10 (p-value). (D) Canonical
  pathways exclusively perturbed at Year 1. Among the 15 pathways, the top 10 (if
  applicable) pathways are listed as positively regulated pathways and pathways with
  no activity pattern available. No negatively regulated pathways were predicted.
  (E) Canonical pathways exclusively perturbed at Year 2. Among the 78 pathways, the
  top 10 pathways are listed for positively regulated pathways, negatively regulated
  pathways, and pathways with no activity pattern available. Positively and negatively
  regulated pathways are arranged according to the z-score. Pathways with no activity
  pattern available are arranged according to the −log10 (p-value). All perturbed
  canonical pathways are listed in Table S4a (Year 0.5), Table S4b (Year 1), and Table
  S4c (Year 2)
