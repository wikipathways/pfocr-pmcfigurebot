figure_title: Model integrating the network involving Churc1, Nodal and Notch-dependent
  pathways in the induction and segregation of germ layers in the Xenopus MZ
caption: 'During blastula stages, Nodal and Churc1 roughly outline neuroectoderm (blue)
  and endomesoderm (yellow/red) presumptive territories in the NIMZ and IMZ, respectively,
  contributing to establishing and restricting dll1 expression to the IMZ during gastrulation.
  dll1 is repressed in the NIMZ, where churc1 is active, and induced through a relay
  Nodal cascade in the pre-involuted mesoderm in the IMZ, where churc1 is inactive.
  High Nodal favors endoderm (yellow) over mesoderm specification (red). Endodermal
  cells, in turn, emit a lower wave of Nodal signaling, promoting mesoderm specification
  and dll1 expression in the IMZ pre-involuted mesoderm. Dll1 signaling activates
  the Notch1 pathway on the NIMZ, which represses mesoderm specification through hes4
  and promotes neuroectoderm, thus refining the boundaries between them. Notch1 activity
  (perhaps triggered by another Dll/Jag ligand) contributes to endomesoderm segregation
  in the IMZ, favoring endoderm over mesoderm. White bold letters/thicker lines: regionally
  active pathways. Small gray letters/thinner gray lines: regionally inactive pathways.
  Green and pink lines represent positive and negative regulation, respectively. Full
  lines: direct regulation, with the strongest strength of connection according to
  experimental evidence. Broken lines: proposed regulation according to the available
  experimental evidence. See Table S1 summarizing the findings of the present work
  and experimental evidence from references supporting this model (; ;  ; ; ; ; ;
