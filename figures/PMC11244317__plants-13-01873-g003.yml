figure_title: Effect of phosphite treatments on the transcription of different hormones.
caption: 'Effect of phosphite treatments on the transcription of different hormones.
  (a) Heatmap of genes of the ABA biosynthesis pathway. (b) Heatmap of the GO term
  “positive regulation of abscisic acid-activated signaling pathway”. (c) Heatmap
  of DEGS related to salicylic acid biosynthesis. (d) Heatmap of the GO term “systemic
  acquired resistance”. (e) Heatmap of DEGs related to jasmonic acid biosynthesis.
  (f) Heatmap of the GO Term “Jasmonic acid-mediated signaling pathway”. Genes of
  the biosynthetic pathways were taken from the Plant Metabolic Network database.
  For all plots: Blue triangles represent downregulated genes, red triangles represent
  upregulated genes, and n.s. stands for non-significant. Likelihood ratio tests according
  to the edgeR pipeline were performed on each pair of genes to determine if there
  are significant differences between treatments'
