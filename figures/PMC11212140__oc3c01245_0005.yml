caption: ZNL-0056 covalently engages Cys775 and Cys797 in EGFR Ba/F3 cells. (A) The
  average IC50 values (mean Â± S.D.) of the indicated compounds in EGFRL858R Ba/F3,
  EGFRL858R/C797S Ba/F3, and EGFRL858R/C775S Ba/F3 cells after 6 h treatment. The
  graph was generated from three independent experiments, each performed with four
  replicates. (B) Immunoblot assessment of the effect of ZNL-0056 on the EGFR signaling
  pathway in EGFRL858R Ba/F3, EGFRL858R/C797S Ba/F3, and EGFRL858R/C775S Ba/F3 cells
  after 6 h treatment. Representative data from two independent experiments are shown.
