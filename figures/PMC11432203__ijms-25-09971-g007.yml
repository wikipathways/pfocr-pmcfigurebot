caption: 'The causality of CD4+ TEM markers and PTB and COVID-19 infection based on
  MR analysis (by Figdraw 2.0). I = instrumental variable relevance: IV is associated
  with the markerâ€™s expressive level. II = no direct effect: IV affects the risk of
  PTB or COVID-19 via exposure, not through other pathways. III = instrumental variable
  independence: IV is not associated with either known or unknown confounders). IV
  = lead SNP of instrumental variables. R-MR = reverse mendelian randomization. Notes:
  The combination of dashed lines and cross implies no correlation. These solid green
  lines represent our conclusion'
