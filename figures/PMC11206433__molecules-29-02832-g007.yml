caption: Effects of different fucoxanthin concentrations (0, 2, 4, or 6 nM) for 24
  h on the Keap1/Nrf2/HO−1 signaling pathway in SCC−25 cells. Data are means ± SDs
  (n = 3). (A) Qualitative depiction of the effects of fucoxanthin on ferroptosis−related
  proteins in SCC−25 cells. (B–H) Quantitative measurements of the effects of fucoxanthin
  on Keap1, Nrf2, p53, SLC7A11, HO−1, GPX4, and TFR1 protein expression in SCC−25
  cells, respectively. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, compared with control
