figure_title: Transcriptomic analysis of pyrvinium pamoate treated MCC cells
caption: (A) Volcano plot showing genes differentially expressed by pyrvinium vs.
  DMSO treatment at 24hrs in WaGa cells. DEGs with Padj < 0.05 and |log2 fold change|
  >1, and exhibiting a reversed expression trend relative to MCC vs. normal skin,
  were labeled in red (DEGs upregulated in MCC) or blue (DEGs downregulated in MCC)
  color. Previously reported MCC maker genes such as ATOH1, SOX2, CHGA, HES6 and NEUROD1
  are labeled in red text. (B) Scatter plot showing the activity prediction of master
  regulators in pyrvinium vs. DMSO treated MCC cells. Blue indicates the TFs with
  decreased activity levels in pyrvinium treated cells and red indicates the TFs with
  increased activity levels in pyrvinium treated cells. (C) GO term enrichment results
  for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in WaGa and MKL1 cells exposed to 1 μM
  pyrvinium vs DMSO for 6 h and 24h. Size of dot represents the number of genes that
  are annotated to the GO term, and the color corresponds to the adjusted p-value
  of hypergeometric test. GO terms are primarily ranked by significance in the MKL1
  24h analysis. (D) Gene-biological concepts network showing the KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis results of significantly upregulated (Padj ≤ 0.05, log2 fold change ≥ 1)
  and downregulated (Padj ≤ 0.05 and log2 fold change ≤ −1) DEGs in both WaGa and
  MKL1 cell lines for 6h and 24h
