caption: The HOG signaling pathway participates in the regulation of calcium (Ca2+)
  homeostasis in Fusarium graminearum. (A) Growth phenotype of the wild-type strain
  PH-1, deletion mutants of the HOG cascade kinases and the complemented strains on
  minimal medium (MM) with or without 0.5 M CaCl2 or 0.025 μg ml−1 calcineurin inhibitor
  FK506 after 3 days of incubation at 25 °C. Mycelial growth inhibition of each strain
  under each treatment was quantified. Line bars indicate standard deviations of three
  repeated experiments. The same letter on the bars indicates no significant difference
  according to the LSD test at p = 0.05. (B) The level of free intracellular Ca2+
  of PH-1, ΔFgSsk2, ΔFgPbs2 and ΔFgHog1 was determined by a laser scanning microscope
  with 2 μM green fluorescent Ca2+ binding dye Fluo-8 AM after each strain was cultured
  in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YEPD) for 12 h at 25 °C. Fluorescence intensity
  was quantified using ImageJ software. Bar = 20 μm. (C) Total 105 conidia of PH-1,
  ΔFgSsk2, ΔFgPbs2 and ΔFgHog1 were prepared by incubating in carboxymethyl cellulose
  (CMC) for 4 days at 25 °C for quantitative assessment of total Ca2+ content. Fluo-8
  fluorescence intensity of each strain was quantified by using BioTek Cytation 5
  cell imaging multi-mode readers. Line bars indicate standard deviations of three
  repeated experiments. The same letter on the bars indicates no significant difference
  according to the LSD test at p = 0.05. (D) The phosphorylation of FgHog1 was increased
  by the treatment with 0.15 M CaCl2 for 5 min and was not detected in ΔFgSsk2. Moreover,
  the increased phosphorylation of FgHog1 was independent of FK506. The relative intensities
  of phosphorylated FgHog1 bands were quantified with ImageJ software
