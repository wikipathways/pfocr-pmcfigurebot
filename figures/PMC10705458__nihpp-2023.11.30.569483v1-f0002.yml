figure_title: Flaviolin production via RppA in CFE reactions.
caption: Flaviolin production via RppA in CFE reactions. (A) Schematic of flaviolin
  biosynthetic pathway by type III PKS, RppA. (B) CFE reactions were initiated with
  increasing concentrations of codon optimized rppA (o-rppA) driven by pT7 promoter
  in plasmid DNA, resulting in increasing flaviolin production (observed by increase
  of absorbance at 340 nm)
