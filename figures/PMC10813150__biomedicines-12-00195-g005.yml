figure_title: Metabolic pathway difference analysis between sham control mice and
  ischemic stroke mice.
caption: Metabolic pathway difference analysis between sham control mice and ischemic
  stroke mice. (A) Metabolic pathway differences analysis. The upper left shows the
  difference between sham control mice versus mice after single MCAO for 1 day; the
  lower left shows the difference between sham control mice versus mice after single
  MCAO for 3 days; the right shows the difference between sham control mice versus
  mice after recurrent MCAO for 2 days. (B) Venn diagrams show the commonly altered
  metabolic pathway numbers when ischemic stroke occurred (left) and the detailed
  pathway list (right)
