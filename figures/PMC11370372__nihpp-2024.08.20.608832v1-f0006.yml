figure_title: NE+EV mediates activation of LX2 cells through ERK1/2 signaling pathway
caption: (A) Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was assessed 6 minutes after treatment of LX2
  cells with and without NE−EV and NE+EV using western blot analysis. Compared to
  non-treated control group and LX2 cells treated with NE−EV, NE+EV treatment markedly
  enhanced levels of phospho-ERK1/2 in LX2 cells. Quantification of band intensity
  from 3 independent experiments showed significant increases in the phospho-ERK1/2
  band from NE+EV treated LX2 cells. GAPDH was used as loading control. (B) Phosphorylation
  of MEK, downstream of ERK1/2, was assessed in LX2 cells after 6 minutes of incubation
  with NE−EV and NE+EV and the result revealed higher phospho-MEK in cells treated
  with NE+EV as compared with NE−EV and negative control. (C) We intravenously administered
  NE−EV or NE+EV to wildtype mice and assessed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in hepatic
  stellate cells 6 hours post injection in the liver of the mice by immunofluorescent
  staining. We observed higher levels of red fluorescent signal (594nm) indicating
  phospho-ERK1/2 co stained with vimentin (488nm) as indicated by green signal in
  the liver of mice injected with NE+EV (n=3). (D) Graph shows red signal intensity
  in the liver of control, NE−EV and NE+EV injected mice, indicating significantly
  increased red signal in the images from NE+EV injected mice (p<0.05)
