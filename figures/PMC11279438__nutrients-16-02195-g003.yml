figure_title: Antioxidative role of vitamin D in muscle dysfunction.
caption: 'Antioxidative role of vitamin D in muscle dysfunction. Blue arrow indicates
  activation; red arrow indicates inhibition. Vitamin D activates the VDR in satellite
  cells, enhancing their self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation capabilities.
  Activation of the VDR also mitigates oxidative stress, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis
  and fusion while reducing oxidative damage and dysfunction. This process improves
  mitochondrial network structure through the regulation of MFN1/2, OPA1, and Drp1
  expression. Vitamin D positively influences Sirt1 activity and enhances mitochondrial
  function. Supplementation with vitamin D activates Sirt1 and AMPK in skeletal muscle
  cells. Vitamin D further increases the expression of irisin precursors in muscle
  cells, contingent upon intact Sirt1 expression. Both AMPK and Sirt1 regulate PGC-1α
  activation and transcription, influencing irisin secretion in skeletal muscle cells.
  Vitamin D upregulates FOXO1 protein and suppresses atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression.
  Additionally, VDS triggers VDR and induces the Nrf2-Keap1 antioxidant pathway. Abbreviations
