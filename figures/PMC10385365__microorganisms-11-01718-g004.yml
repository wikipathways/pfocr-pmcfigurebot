caption: Effects of L. lactis subsp. lactis CAB701 treatment on the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The multiplicity
  of infection (MOI, bacterial cell number/macrophage cell number) was 100. (a) Western
  blot reveals the expression of MAPK pathway proteins in macrophages treated with
  L. lactis subsp. lactis CAB701. Graphs depict the relative ratios of (b) p-JNK/JNK,
  (c) p-p38/p38, and (d) p-ERK/ERK in the treated macrophages. Western blots are representative
  of three independent experiments. Macrophages treated with 1 Î¼g/mL of lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS) were used as the positive control sample. Different letters among groups represent
  significant differences at p < 0.05
