caption: OsJAZ4 function in rice yield traits. (A) Morphology of mature osjaz4 and
  NPB plants in normal field conditions. Bar = 20 cm. (B–D) Panicle types, grain length,
  and grain width of osjaz4 and NPB; bar = 5 cm; bar = 0.5 cm. (E) Percentage of seed
  setting osjaz4 and NPB (n = 10). (F,G) The content of endogenous GA1 and GA4 in
  osjaz4 and NPB. (H,I) qRT-PCR analysis of genes associated with GA synthesis pathway
  in osjaz4 and NPB. Error bars indicate SD (n = 3). Data were statistically analyzed
  by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Asterisks indicate
  significant differences (** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001). Three independent biological
  replicates were tested, each yielding similar results
