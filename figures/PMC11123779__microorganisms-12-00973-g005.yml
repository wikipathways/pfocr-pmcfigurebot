figure_title: Protein–protein gene network in RA-infected ducks.
caption: Protein–protein gene network in RA-infected ducks. An interaction analysis
  of all DEGs was performed using STRING version 12 (http://string-db.org/ accessed
  on 5 March 2024). Each line and node correspond to interactions and significantly
  enriched related pathways. The interaction of IL-26 and IL-17 is highlighted in
  dotted line. The network was inferred using a high confidence (0.700) interaction
  score using the full STRING network. Disconnected nodes were not included
