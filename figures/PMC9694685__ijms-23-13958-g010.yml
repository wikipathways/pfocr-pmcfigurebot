caption: 'Metabolism and signaling pathway map. Abbreviations: AUX1, auxin transporter-like
  protein; AUX/IAA, auxin-responsive protein IAA; GH3, indole-3-acetic acid-amido
  synthetase GH3; SAUR, auxin-responsive protein SAUR; ETR/ ERS, ethylene receptor
  1; CTR1, MAPKKK serine/threonine-protein kinase CTR1; MKK9, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase 9; MPK3/6, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/6; EIN3/EIL, ethylene-insensitive
  3-like 3 protein; ERF94, ethylene-responsive transcription factor 94; PYR/PYL, abscisic
  acid receptor PYR/PYL; PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; SnRK2, serine/threonine-protein
  kinase SRK2; MAP3K17/18, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 17/18; MKK3,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3; MAPK7/14, mitogen-activated protein kinase
  7/14; CDPK, calcium-dependent protein kinase; RBOHD, respiratory burst oxidase homolog
  D; CNGCS, cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel; CaM/CML, calmodulin and calmodulin-like
  protein; NOS, NO-associated protein 1; Pti13, PTI1-like tyrosine protein kinase
  3; and MYB30, transcription factor MYB30. The signaling components indicated by
  the boxes filled with the red color were up-regulated by VDAL, whereas those denoted
  by the boxes filled with the green color were down-regulated by VDAL. The signaling
  components indicated by the boxes filled with the light blue color were not affected
  by VDAL.'
