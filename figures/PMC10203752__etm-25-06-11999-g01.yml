caption: Proanthocyanidins structure, properties and application. Proanthocyanidins,
  a type of polyphenolic compound, are widespread in fruits and plants, such as grapes,
  cranberry, black currant, pomegranate, cocoa and medlar. Proanthocyanidins possess
  antioxidation, immunomodulation and anti-inflammation effects and are used in numerous
  disorders (such as OS-associated diseases inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular
  dysfunction and diabetes). Mechanism of action involves inhibiting OS (decreasing
  ROS and MDA and increasing SOD, GSH and catalase), reducing inflammatory responses
  (inhibiting IL-17, IL-6, IL-21, IL-22 and TNF-α) and balancing immunity (reducing
  Th2, Th17 and B cells and increasing Treg cells) via the suppression of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. OS, oxidative stress; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MDA, malondialdehyde;
  TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor κ-B; Th, T helper; IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; SOD,
  superoxide dismutase; GSH, glutathione; Ɵ, suppression; ↑↑, upregulation; ↓↓, downregulation
