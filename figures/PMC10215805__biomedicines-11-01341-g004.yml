caption: 'Fold changes in the expression levels of IL-10Ra (A) and components of the
  JAK-STAT signaling pathway: JAK1 (B), STAT1 (C), STAT3 (D), STAT5a (E), STAT5b (F)
  in the hippocampi of EE and SH female (pink) and male (blue) rats. EE: enriched
  environment, SH: standard housing. ♂—males, ♀—females. A striped pattern of the
  bars refers to EE, solid fill—to SH conditions. The values are represented as mean
  ± SEM, ** p ≤ 0.01,**** p ≤ 0.0001 (t-test)'
