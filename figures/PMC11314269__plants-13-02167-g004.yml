figure_title: Gene expression heatmaps of genes involved in the plant–pathogen interaction
  pathway of B.
caption: 'Gene expression heatmaps of genes involved in the plant–pathogen interaction
  pathway of B. rapa in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). The pathways
  are organized into three categories: (a) the perception of pathogens by pattern-recognition
  receptors (PRRs), (b) pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), and (c) effector-triggered
  immunity (ETI). Heatmap colors represent row-scaled Z-score of TMM-normalized TPM
  values. The functional descriptions corresponding to the gene are derived from the
  NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (Annotation release ID: 103.20201202).
  The gene labels in red indicate DEGs with a fold-change of 4 or more induced by
  SS and HS2 strains'
