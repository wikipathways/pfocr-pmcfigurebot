caption: Metabolome-Wide Association Study (MWAS) of T3DB-annotated chemicals higher
  in third trimester (T3) serum. Association of seven T3DB-annotated chemicals (Table
  4) that are higher in breast cancer than non-cases with the metabolome (9,042 metabolic
  features) from T3 serum (n = 351 for non-cases, n = 172 for breast cancer) are examined
  using xMWAS. The network is visualized at |r| â‰¥ 0.3 and includes two communities
  (C4 and C5) showing central four chemicals with tight connections [C4 (orange)]
  than C5 (blue)]. Representative metabolites of pathways associated with community
  are shown next to each community
