caption: The main molecular biological functions of 4,944 differential genes analyzed
  by GSEA. (a) GSEA analysis results of KEGG signaling pathways such as oxidative
  phosphorylation, the intestinal immune network produced by IGA, p53 signal pathway,
  cell cycle, and cancer pathway. The ordinate represents an enrichment score. (b)
  GSEA analysis results of p53 signal pathway. NES in the upper right corner represents
  the normalized enrichment score, p.adj represents the corrected p-value, and FDR
  represents the false discovery rate. (c) Correlation analysis diagram of 27 DEGs,
  with X indicating significance less than 95% (p > 0.05)
