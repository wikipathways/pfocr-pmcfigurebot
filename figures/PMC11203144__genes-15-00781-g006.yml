figure_title: Scatter plot of enrichment pathways for genes in black, cyan, light-cyan,
  and yellow modules.
caption: 'Scatter plot of enrichment pathways for genes in black, cyan, light-cyan,
  and yellow modules. Note: The horizontal coordinate is the ratio of the number of
  differential genes annotated to the total number of differential genes in the KEGG
  enrichment pathway, and the vertical coordinate is the KEGG enrichment pathway.
  The size of the dots in the graph represents the number of genes annotated to the
  KEGG enrichment pathway, and the colors from red to purple represent the significance
  of the enrichment: (a) black; (b) cyan; (c) light cyan; (d) yellow'
