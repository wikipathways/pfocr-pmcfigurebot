figure_title: Vitamin K3 inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway induced
  by SARS-CoV-2 N protein.
caption: Vitamin K3 inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway induced by
  SARS-CoV-2 N protein. HLMECs were pre-incubated with indicated concentrations of
  vitamin K3 for 1 h before stimulation with N protein (1 μg/mL) for 15 min. (A) The
  protein levels of phospho-IKKα/β (pIKKα/β), IKKα, IKKβ, phospho-p65 (pp65), p65,
  phospho-IκBα (pIκBα), and IκBα were examined by western blot. Quantitative analyses
  of (B) pIKKα/β, (C) IKKα, (D) IKKβ, (F) pIκBα, (G) IκBα were normalized to GAPDH
  levels and expressed as relative fold changes versus the vehicle group or N protein-treated
  group. Quantitative analysis of (E) pp65 was normalized to p65 levels and expressed
  as relative fold changes versus N protein-treated group. Data were shown as means
  ± SD. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01
