caption: Overview of the key components involved in the regulation of activation/inactivation
  of the canonical or Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Some of the drugs and natural compounds
  that inhibit molecular players of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade are shown
  in red. These drugs have been tested in preclinical studies, as outlined in the
  main text, are in clinical trials, or are repurposed approved drugs tested in osteosarcoma
  with the aim of targeting Wnt pathway (see also Table 2). LRP—Low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein, GSK-3β—Glycogen synthase kinase 3β, CKIα—Casein kinase
  1α, APC—Adenomatous polyposis coli, and TCF/LEF—T-cell-specific transcription factor/Lymphoid
  enhancer-binding factor. Created with BioRender.com (figure created on 27 April
