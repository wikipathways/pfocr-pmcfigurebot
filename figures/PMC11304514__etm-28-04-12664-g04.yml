caption: Analysis of the association between the MAPK signaling pathway and METTL14.
  (A) Expression levels of genes associated with the MAPK pathway (n=30). Data are
  presented as the mean ± SD and were statistically tested using the unpaired two-independent
  sample t-test. ***P<0.001. (B) Correlation between METTL14 and components of the
  MAPK pathway. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the data. (C) Correlation
  between components associated with macrophage polarization and components of the
  MAPK pathway. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the data. *P<0.05
  and **P<0.01. (D) Expression levels of genes associated with the MAPK pathway in
  the METTL14 low-expression and METTL14 high-expression groups. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD and were statistically tested using the unpaired two-independent
  sample t-test. *P<0.05. RA, rheumatoid arthritis; HC, healthy control; METTL14,
  methyltransferase 14; ns, not significant
