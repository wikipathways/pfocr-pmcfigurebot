figure_title: Chondrocytes have enhanced redox metabolism
caption: a Single-cell RNA-seq analysis, UMAP-based visualization of major classes
  of non-hematopoietic cells (bone and bone marrow fractions) based on two published
  single cell RNA sequencing datasets, annotated post hoc (see Supplementary Fig.Â 
  for cell specific markers of individual cell types) and colored by clustering. b
  Dot plots of selected reporter metabolites of individual cell types using reporter
  metabolite analysis test. c Expression (row-wide Z score of normalized expression
  level; single cell RNA sequencing) of metabolic related genes (rows) in the cells
  of each cluster (columns). Depicted in bold with an asterisk are the enzymes that
  require NAD/NADH or NADP/NADPH redox reactions.

  development in mice.
