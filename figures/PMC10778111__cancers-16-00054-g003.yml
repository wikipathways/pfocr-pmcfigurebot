caption: Non-coding (nc)RNA-regulated signaling pathways involved in gastric cancer
  invasion. The function of the signaling pathway focusing on their roles in regulating
  cell invasion is summarized. The experimentally identified ncRNAs act as regulators
  of several principal pathways involved in invasion–metastasis programs. Chapter
  numbers shown in this figure represent how these chapters relate to the process
  of invasion and metastasis
