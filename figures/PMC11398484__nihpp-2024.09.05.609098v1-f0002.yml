figure_title: Time-resolved proteomics reveals biologically coherent shifts across
  gastruloid development
caption: (A) Heatmap depicting the temporal dynamics of protein expression across
  human and mouse gastruloid differentiation samples and replicates. (B) Dotplot indicating
  the top Gene Ontology (GO) terms enrichment across clusters. Clusters 5, 9, and
  10 did not have significantly enriched GO terms. Color scale indicates the Benjamini
  Hochberg (BH) adjusted p-values. Size of dots corresponds to the number of proteins
  associated with a particular GO term. (C) Volcano plots of the protein expression
  changes across consecutive stages of human gastruloid differentiation, where x-axis
  represents the log2 fold change between two adjacent timepoints and y-axis represents
  the negative log10 of the Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p-value. (D) The log2 protein
  abundance ratio of early (yellow) or late (red) gastruloids compared to primed human
  ESCs (RUES2-GLR) for proteins associated with pluripotency and central metabolism
  including TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway and oxidative phosphorylation. Mean
  abundance ratios are indicated with dots and error bars represent the standard deviation
