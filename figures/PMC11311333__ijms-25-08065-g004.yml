caption: WGCNA analysis of the DEGs in ZPX and XK4 bamboo shoots after cold storage.
  (A,B) Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of ZPX and XK4 D. farinosus
  bamboo shoots after cold storage for different days, soft threshold calculation
  results (A), and WGCNA analysis module clustering results (B). (C) Heatmap of gene
  expression clustering contained in the red module. (D) KEGG enrichment results for
  genes contained in the red module. (E) GO enrichment results for genes contained
  in the red module. (F) OMT, pheylalanine, flavonoid, and their co-expressed transcription
  factor-related networks in the red module; yellow represents flavonoid synthesis
  pathway genes; orange represents phenylpropane metabolism pathway genes; and green
  represents transcription factors. Detailed data on transcriptome analyses are in
  Supplementary Table S6
