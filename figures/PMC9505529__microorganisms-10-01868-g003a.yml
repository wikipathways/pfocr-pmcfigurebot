caption: Specific oral pathogenic microorganisms and underlying mechanism patterns
  in IBD. (a) In addition to activating the IL-17F/NF-κB pathway, F. nucleatum can
  also damage the integrity of intestinal epithelium by regulating the expression
  and distribution of tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 and occluding, and
  promoting proinflammatory cytokine production to exacerbate IBD. P. gingivalis can
  secrete proteases, gingipains, detaching intestinal mucus by degrading ZO-1, inactivating
  quite a few vital pro-inflammatory mediators made by DCs and/or T cells, which may
  alter the local immune microenvironment. In addition, P. gingivalis itself can induce
  a semi-TH2-like response, increasing the Th17/Treg ratio in the colon as well as
  impacting the composition of gut microbiota, and decrease gut-barrier function through
  reducing the expression of TJP-1 and occluding. (b) AICC attaches to and invades
  host intestinal epithelial cells, triggering the host cell to produce IL-8, IL-12,
  and IFN-γto maintain its own survival by inhibiting the autophagy pathway. AToCC
  enables the secretion of Zot, which targets the tight junctions of epithelial cells
  to damage the intestinal epithelial barrier, induces host cell apoptosis and the
  epithelial production of TNF-α and IL-8, and upregulates the production of TNF-α
  in THP-1 macrophage-like cells. In addition, a specific strain of C. concisus enables
  the upregulation of the neutrophil-adherence molecule CD11b. (c) K. pneumoniae,
  a Gram-negative bacterium, can reside in the gut, downregulate the expression of
  TJP, claudin-1, and ZO-1, and increase the activity of mucosal macrophages to secrete
  proinflammatory cytokines, like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, to trigger gut inflammation.
  K. pneumoniae activates Th1 response via stimulation of TLR-4 and presentation of
  OmpX by DC, and further amplifies Th1 response by activating epithelial cells to
  produce IL-18 through TLR-4. Moreover, periodontitis caused by K. pneumoniae results
  in oral pathobiont-reactive Th17 cells being generated in the oral cavity, which
  can be transferred to the inflamed gut along the lymph node to induce colitis.
