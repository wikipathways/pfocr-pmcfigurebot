figure_title: IFN-γ treatment in vitro replicates the in vivo IFN-γ response and changes
  the expression of a subset of genes relevant to esophageal biology
caption: (A) PCA plot showing separation between IFN-γ treated organoids and IFN-α
  treated and unstimulated organoids based on gene expression profiles using the first
  three principal components that account for most of the variation in the dataset.
  (B) Volcano plot showing differential gene expression in IFN-γ treated organoids
  versus unstimulated organoid cultures. (C) The ridge plot shows the running enrichment
  score of 14 pathways with positive enrichment scores and 10 pathways with negative
  enrichment scores in IFN-γ treated organoids and p.adjust < 0.05. (D) Venn diagram
  illustrating the overlap of upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) genes shared
  between esophagus-specific genes and IFN-γ treated organoids
