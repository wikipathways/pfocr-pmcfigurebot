caption: Transcriptome analysis of the leaves of eggplants cultivated with different
  concentrations (0.5 and 5 mM) of nitrate and inoculated with WFT. Fifteen-day-old
  seedlings were moved to a nutrient solution with either 0.25 mM Ca(NO3)2 (LN) or
  2.5 mM Ca(NO3)2 (HN) and cultivated for 5 d and then inoculated with WFT for 24
  h for transcriptome analysis. KEGG enrichment analysis of the top 20 upregulated
  genes between the LN and HN treatments (A) and LNWFT and HNWFT treatments (B). Heatmap
  analysis of the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthetic process, the regulation of the JA-mediated
  signaling pathway, the salicylic acid (SA) biosynthetic process, and the SA-mediated
  signaling pathway of upregulated genes between LN and HN treatments (C) or LNWFT
  and HNWFT treatments (D). For comparison, the gene expression levels were standardized.
  LN, 0.25 mM Ca(NO3)2 for 5 d; HN, 2.5 mM Ca(NO3)2 cultured for 5 d; LNWFT, 0.25
  mM Ca(NO3)2 cultured for 5 d and then infested with WFT for 24 h; HNWFT, 2.5 mM
  Ca(NO3)2 cultured for 5 d and then infested with WFT for 24 h
