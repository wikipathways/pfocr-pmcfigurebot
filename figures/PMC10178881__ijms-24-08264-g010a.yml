figure_title: Effects of probiotics supplementation on the Nrf-2 signaling pathway
  in the intestine of the rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress.
caption: 'Effects of probiotics supplementation on the Nrf-2 signaling pathway in
  the intestine of the rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress. (A): Blot bands
  of protein expression of Nfr-2, HO-1, and NQO-1 in the intestine. The protein density
  of (B): Nfr-2, (C): HO-1, (D): NQO-1 was quantified relative to β-actin, and used
  as an internal control. The values are mean ± S.E.M (n = 6). ** indicates a significant
  difference (p < 0.05) of Prob from the control group, * indicates a significant
  difference (p < 0.01) of CUMS from the control and probiotics (Prob) group, # indicates
  a significant difference (p < 0.01) of CUMS+Prob from CUMS group; one-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s post hoc test'
