caption: DE miRNAs in S. gordonii-infected mandibles (8- and 16-weeks). (A) The volcano
  plot depicts the upregulated (green) and downregulated (red) miRNAs that showed
  a fold difference of Â±1.1 with a p-value of <0.05. The log2 fold change is on the
  x-axis, and the negative log of the p-value is on the y-axis. The black dots represent
  the miRNAs that do not pass the filter parameters. A total of 191 significant upregulated
  miRNAs and 22 downregulated miRNAs were identified in 8 weeks of S. gordonii-infected
  mice compared to 8 weeks of sham-infected mice (n = 10). Ten significant upregulated
  miRNAs and 32 downregulated miRs were identified in 16 weeks of S. gordonii-infected
  mice compared to 16-week sham-infected mice (n = 10). (B) Venn diagram analysis
  illustrates the distribution of DE miRs in 8-week and 16-week infections with S.
  gordonii. (C,D) Predicted functional pathway analysis of DE miRNAs from S. gordonii-infected
  mandibles. Bubble Plot of KEGG analysis on predicted target genes of DE miRNAs in
  S. gordonii-infected mice at 8- and 16 weeks of infection compared to sham-infected
  mice. The KEGG pathways are displayed on the y-axis, and the x-axis represents the
  false discovery rate (FDR), which means the probability of false positives in all
  tests. The size and color of the dots represent the number of predicted genes and
  corresponding p-value, respectively. Eleven DE miRNAs were shown to be involved
  in bacterial invasion of epithelial cells during 8 weeks of infection. Red color
  highlighted pathways explained in detailed in this manuscript
