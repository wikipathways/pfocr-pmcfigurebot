caption: Effects of compound 25 on p-JAK, other signaling pathways, and other STAT.
  (A,B) A549 (A) and DU145 (B) cells were treated with different concentrations (0,
  1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 μM) of compound 25 for 2 h. Subsequently, protein lysates were
  collected, and the expression of p-JAK was detected by Western blot. n = 3. (C,D)
  A549 (C) and DU145 (D) cells were treated with different concentrations (0, 1, 2.5,
  5, 10, 15 μM) of compound 25 for 1 h. The expressions of p-NF-κB, p-AKT, p-GSK3β,
  and p-JNK were detected by Western blot. n = 3. (E) A549 cells were treated with
  different concentrations (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 μM) of compound 25 for 2 h. The expressions
  of p-STAT1 and p-STAT5 were detected by Western blot. n = 3
