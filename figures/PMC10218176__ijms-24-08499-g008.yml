caption: Protein subcomplex analysis of GPR19 immunoprecipitates. To assess the potential
  capacity for MDC1 and/or prohibitin (PHB)-associated complexes to link with GPR19,
  co-immunoprecipitation of MDC1, PHB, CBR1, and EIF4A1 with HA-epitope-tagged GPR19
  was assessed in control and also aging-related stress conditions (AceK–Acesulfame
  K; low glucose; peroxide–hydrogen peroxide exposure) (A). Western blots indicate
  the specific protein presence in either the immunoprecipitated (IP) or the input
  whole cell lysate (w.c.l, 2% of total cell lysate loaded). Histograms indicating
  the mean of three co-immunoprecipitation replicates indicate stress-related potentiation
  of MDC1, PHB, and CBR1 (but not EIF4A1) with GPR19 (B). Histogram-based data shown
  represent the means ± SEM (standard error of the mean). The significance level is
  indicated in each figure as * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01. Pathway enrichment probability
  was calculated via over-representation analysis (ORA)
