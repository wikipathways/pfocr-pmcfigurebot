figure_title: Metabolome-Wide Association Study (MWAS) of T3DB-annotated chemicals
  higher in second trimester (T2) serum.
caption: 'Metabolome-Wide Association Study (MWAS) of T3DB-annotated chemicals higher
  in second trimester (T2) serum. Association of seventeen T3DB-annotated features
  (Table 3) that are higher in breast cancer than non-cases with the metabolome (9,042
  metabolic features) from T2 serum (n = 384 for non-cases, n = 182 for breast cancer)
  are examined using xMWAS. The outcome of xMWAS analysis is visualized with two separate
  networks at |r| â‰¥ 0.3. The networks include three communities (C1, C2, C3) and show
  central seven chemicals (F1-F7) with tight connections [C1 (orange). C2 (blue),
  C3 (green)]. Representative metabolites of pathways associated with community are
  shown next to each community. DHET: dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid, EETA: epoxyeicosatrienoic
  acid, TG: triglyceride, PC: phosphatidylcholine'
