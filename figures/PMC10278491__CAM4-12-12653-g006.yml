caption: miR‐28‐5p inhibitor inactivated Wnt signaling in NSCLC cells. In total, 140,
  658 and 2249 target genes were predicted by TargetScan7.2, miRanda, and PITA software,
  respectively (A). After GO analysis on the overlapped 66 genes, the top 5 hits of
  GO_CC, GO_MF, and GO_BP were presented (B). Genes were enriched in oncogenic pathways
  evidenced by KEGG analysis (C). In A549 and H1650, miR‐28‐5p expression in miR‐NC
  mimic group and miR‐28‐5p mimic group was assessed by RT‐qPCR (D). TOP/FOP luciferase
  reporter assay was performed to explore the relation between miR‐28‐5p and Wnt signaling
  pathway in A549 and H1650 (E). The effect of miR‐28‐5p inhibitor on p‐β‐catenin
  of A549 and H1650 was examined by western blot (F). **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, vs.
  miR‐NC inhibitor.
