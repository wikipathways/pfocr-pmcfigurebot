figure_title: Acne triggers signaling pathway changes within the skin across all cell
  clusters
caption: A) UMAP plot for nonlesional and lesional cells colored by lesional types,
  nonlesional cells are shown in light blue, and lesional cells are shown in red.
  B) UMAP plot showing the nonlesional and lesional samples split by lesional types.
  C) All detected signaling pathways were ranked based on the differences of overall
  information flow within the inferred networks between nonlesional and lesional samples.
  The signaling pathways in green show higher enrichment in nonlesional samples, those
  in black have similar enrichment in both conditions, and those in red are more prevalent
  in lesional samples. Bar graphs are displayed in both non-stacked (left) and stacked
  (right) formats. D-E) Heatmap show the comparison of outgoing (D) or incoming (E)
  signaling associated with each cell type between nonlesional and lesional samples.
  F-G) Dot plot showing the representative ligands (F) or receptors (G) genes from
  ten signaling pathway which were turned on in lesional compared with nonlesional
  samples. The color scale represents the scaled expression average of each gene,
  and the dot size represents the percentage of cells expressing each gene
