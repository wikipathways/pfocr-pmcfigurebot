caption: Reduction of liver fibrosis by preventive pharmacological CCR2 inhibition
  with CVC. (A-C) In the prevention experiment, wild-type mice were administered 2
  dosages of CCl4 in addition to either 4 dosages of saline (CCl4 group) or CVC (CVC
  group) per week for 6 weeks. Mice in the olive oil group were i.p. injected with
  olive oil for 6 weeks. Liver fibrosis was analyzed by Sirius red staining and IF
  of collagen I and αSMA (A). The protein levels of CCR2, collagen I, and αSMA were
  determined by WB (B). The number of CCR2+ immune cells in the liver and peripheral
  blood was quantified by IF and FCM (A, C), n=6/group. (D-E) RNA sequencing was performed
  in murine livers from the CCl4 and CVC groups. A heatmap of the top 30 DEGs in the
  two groups (D) and KEGG pathway analysis of the targeted DEGs (E) are shown. n=3/group.
