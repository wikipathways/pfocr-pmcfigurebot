caption: A schematic illustration of the impact of salidroside (SAL) and hypoxia on
  the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α)/vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) signaling pathway. SAL and hypoxia inhibit the degradation of HIF-1α (red
  designation, right side), leading to the accumulation of HIF-1α (green designation,
  left side) in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, HIF-1α translocates to the nucleus, where
  it dimerizes with hypoxia-inducible factor 1-beta (HIF-1β) and binds to the hypoxia-responsive
  element (HRE). This interaction initiates the transcription of the VEGF gene, which
  in turn stimulates the synthesis of VEGF in the cytoplasm. The newly synthesized
  VEGF is then secreted out of the cell, where it binds to VEGF receptors (VEGF-R)
  on the surface of endothelial cells, stimulating their proliferation and leading
  to the formation of new blood vessels. It is noteworthy that SAL promotes angiogenesis
  in a manner similar to hypoxia, but potentially offers a more favorable anabolic
  mechanism, as it does not induce biological stress in the cells
