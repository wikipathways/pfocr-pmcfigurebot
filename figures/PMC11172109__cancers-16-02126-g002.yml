figure_title: High dietary phosphate and cancer-cell signaling [96].
caption: High dietary phosphate and cancer-cell signaling [96]. This flowchart shows
  that high dietary phosphate activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway while deactivating tumor suppression by PTEN and CTMP, increasing
  cell growth in tumorigenesis
