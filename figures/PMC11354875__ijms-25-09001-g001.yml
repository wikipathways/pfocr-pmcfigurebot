caption: 'Profiling of LncRNAs in COPD and lung cancer. (A) Representative network
  of interacting lncRNAs/mRNAs in lung cancer: This network visualization offers a
  comprehensive view of the intricate interactions between these RNA species (indirect
  interaction mediated by miRNAs), highlighting their regulatory roles and potential
  significance in the context of lung cancer. By mapping out these interactions, this
  representation aims to unravel the complex molecular mechanisms underlying lung
  cancer development and progression. (B) Representative network of interacting lncRNAs/mRNAs
  in COPD: This network elucidates the intricate relationships between these RNA molecules,
  shedding light on their regulatory roles and potential implications in COPD pathogenesis.
  Through systematic analysis, this representation aims to provide insights into the
  underlying molecular mechanisms driving COPD progression. (C) Venn Diagram to illustrate
  the shared lnRNAs between COPD and lung cancer: This visual representation showcases
  the overlapping lncRNA profiles between the two respiratory conditions, offering
  valuable insights into potential common molecular pathways and regulatory mechanisms;
  the blue color indicates lncRNAs and the red color indicates mRNAs. This figure
  created using Cytoscape 3.10.2 software, integrates data derived from Supplementary
  Excel Files compiled from the PubMed database'
