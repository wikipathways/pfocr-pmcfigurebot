figure_title: Changes in the dopaminergic synthesis pathway due to treatment with
  the CM of transfected rASTROs.
caption: 'Changes in the dopaminergic synthesis pathway due to treatment with the
  CM of transfected rASTROs. (A,B) Levels of proteins involved in the dopamine synthesis
  pathway, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), and Nurr1.
  (C) mRNA expression of TH, DAT, and Nurr1 in N27 cells treated with the CM of transfected
  rASTROs. N = 3; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis; ns, not significant;
  *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; #, p < 0.05 based on Student’s t-test;
  ##, p < 0.01 based on Student’s t-test; ###, p < 0.001 based on Student’s t-test.
  (D) Dopamine levels in the culture media of N27 cells treated with the CM of transfected
  rASTROs determined using ELISA. N = 4 (average of triplicate assays); one-way ANOVA
  with Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001'
