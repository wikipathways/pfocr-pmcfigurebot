figure_title: Metabolites within the methionine salvage pathway increase in DPT burn
  wounds treated with AFSG compared to FBD.
caption: Metabolites within the methionine salvage pathway increase in DPT burn wounds
  treated with AFSG compared to FBD. (A) Schematic representation of the methionine
  salvage pathway and the observed differences in AFSG compared to FBD treatment in
  DPT wounds on Day 7. (B) Abundance differences of identified compounds within the
  pathway in DPT wounds on Day 7 (* Studentsâ€™ t-test, FDR Bonferroni, p < 0.05). Red
  is AFSG, and blue is FBD. The calculated normalized intensities for taurine did
  not show differences among the wounds, while cysteine was not detected
