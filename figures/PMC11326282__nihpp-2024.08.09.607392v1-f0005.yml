  conserved in zebrafisha.
caption: WNT pathway upregulation and cilia downregulation by ZCRB1 loss are conserved
  in zebrafisha. Cilia formation in Tg(actb2:Mmu.Arl13b-GFP)hsc5Tg transgenic zebrafish
  as shown in kidney tissue. Cilia are shown in green.b. Quantification of total PC
  in Cas12a and zcrb1 crispant embryos, WT embryos injected with ZCRB1 mRNA, and zcrb1
  crispant embryos injected with ZCRB1 mRNA. Numbers above brackets represent the
  p-value as measured by an ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  test (omnibus p-value=****<0.0001).c. Analysis of gastrulation and body-axis phenotypes
  in zcrb1 crispants in the presence of the Wnt inhibitor XAV-939d. Quantification
  of total PC in zcrb1 crispants in the presence of Wnt inhibitor XAV-939. Numbers
  above brackets represent the p-value as measured by an ordinary one-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (omnibus p-value=****<0.0001)
