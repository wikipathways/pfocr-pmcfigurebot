figure_title: KEGG analysis of acetylated proteins.
caption: 'KEGG analysis of acetylated proteins. (A,B) KEGG analysis was performed
  for up-regulated and down-regulated acetylated proteins, and a heatmap was used
  to show the expression changes of acetylated proteins of important signalling pathway
  proteins. KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes'
