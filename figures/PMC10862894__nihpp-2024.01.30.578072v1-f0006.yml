figure_title: Membrane localization of Casein kinase 1 is important for normal regulation
  of the TORC2 signaling pathway
caption: Wild-type and akr1Δ cells were grown to early log phase at 25°C in YPD medium.
  Cells were washed into YPG/E medium and samples were collected at the indicated
  time points. The behavior of Ypk-pT662 and Ypk1 was assayed by western blot at the
  indicated times
article_title: Casein kinase 1 controls components of a TORC2 signaling network in
  budding yeast
