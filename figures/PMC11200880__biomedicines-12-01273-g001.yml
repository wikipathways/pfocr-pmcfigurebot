figure_title: Oxytocin signaling brain pathway.
caption: Oxytocin signaling brain pathway. The signaling pathway for the comparison,
  EAE/CBD asymptomatic vs. EAE/CBD symptomatic, was generated from IPA. Oxytocin was
  significantly increased (red) in CBD-treated asymptomatic mice, which is predicted
  to lead to downstream decreases (green) in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1B
  (IL1B), inflammasome, and PI3K. CO, corn oil (vehicle)
