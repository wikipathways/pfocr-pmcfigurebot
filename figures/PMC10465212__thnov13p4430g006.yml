caption: Activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway in HSCs during progression of NASH-fibrosis-HCC.
  (A) Representative micrographs of immunofluorescent staining of α-SMA (green) and
  Gli-1 (red) in rat primary HSCs. DAPI was used for nucleus staining (blue). Gli-1-positive
  presented in nucleus indicated the activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway. Images
  were taken at original magnification (630×). Scale bars = 50 μm. (B) Representative
  micrographs of immunofluorescent staining of α-SMA (green) and Gli-1 (red) in liver
  sections of HFCD-HF/G diet-fed mice for 2, 5, 9, 12 and 14 months. Images were taken
  at original magnification (200×). Scale bars = 50 μm. Amplified micrographs were
  the enlargement of the micrographs at 9, 12 and 14 months above. The co-localization
  of α-SMA with Gli-1 was indicated by arrow symbols. Amplified images were taken
  at original magnification (630×). Scale bars = 50 μm. (C) The quantitative analysis
  of Hedgehog signaling pathway in activated HSCs from 2 to 14 months. (D) The quantitative
  analysis of Hedgehog signaling pathway in hepatocytes from 2 to 14 months. (E) Immunofluorescent
  staining of α-SMA (green) and Gli-1 (red) and (F) SA-β-Gal staining on two continuous
  frozen liver sections of HFCD-HF/G-fed mice for 9 months. The same senescent HSCs
  with activated Hedgehog signaling pathway were indicated by arrow symbols. Images
  were taken at original magnification (630×). Scale bars = 50 μm. (G) Relative mRNA
  levels of Hedgehog signaling pathway genes (Gli-1, PTCH, cyclin D1 and BCL-2) in
  senescent HSCs. (H) Relative mRNA levels of Wnt signaling pathway genes (β-catenin
  and c-Myc) in senescent HSCs. All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05 compared
  to control
