  A timeline of Earth history with the rise of O2 and the appearance of relevant groups of prokaryotes. Blue boxes emphasize the GOE, the onset of O2-dependent enzymes, and questions concerning their evolution and functions. The number 365 represents the number of O2-dependent reactions in KEGG that we mapped to protein families (see text). SOD: superoxide dismutase; Nox: NADH oxidases (diaphorases), which are oxygen detoxifying enzymes [9]. Data from references [1,2,10–14]. Note that ultra-light carbon in 3.8 Ga rocks can be interpreted as evidence of both archaeal methanogens [15] and bacterial acetogens, which carry the same isotope signal [16], because both fix CO2
  via the acetyl-CoA pathway. A broken line reaching to 10% PAL around the end of the GOE indicates the Lomagundi excursion [10]. The reasons why O2 levels remained near the Pasteur point for 1.8 billion years are still discussed. Numerous geological causes [10] and one biological cause [12] for the existence of the boring billion have been proposed. It is undebated that cyanobacteria (and their descendants, plastids) generated the current global supply of O2
  via one single enzyme and one single enzyme activity: the conserved Mn4CaO5-containing oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II. O2 is written as •O–O• instead of O=O to underscore its diradical nature [4]. By 3.4–3.3 Ga, anoxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes were generating stromatolites in aerial settings [17]
