figure_title: Small compound screen reveals upstream signaling programs of polyamine
  metabolism
caption: (A) Design of compound screen. (B) Volcano plots of iPASnFR-L response to
  individual compounds at 3 time points (24, 48, 72 h). Numbers and individual data
  points of compounds that significantly (P < 0.05) increased (red) or decreased (blue)
  iPASnFR-L signal are indicated. (C) Heatmap showing fold changes of the top 25 compounds
  either increasing or decreasing iPASnFR-L signal at 72 h. (D) Fold enrichment of
  pathway classes with which the top 25 compounds have been previously associated.
  Each compound in (C) is marked with hues corresponding to those in (D) according
  to their related pathways
