figure_title: Wnt Signaling pathway.
caption: Wnt Signaling pathway. The diagram provides an overview of the major components
  and interactions within the Wnt signaling pathway such as LEF1 and TCF/LEF1 complex.
  The color assignments in IPA are based on statistical analyses, such as the z-score.
  The z-score compares the observed gene expression changes in a given dataset to
  a reference dataset, assessing the significance and direction of those changes.
  Positive z-scores indicate upregulation = red, orange = activated, whereas negative
  z-scores indicate downregulation = green, blue = inhibited, and z-scores close to
  zero indicate no significant change = no color, and purple indicates interactions
  of two or more factors. The color scheme employed in this figure is consistent with
  the color scheme utilized in all presented figures
