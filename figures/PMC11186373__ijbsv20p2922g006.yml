figure_title: SGK1 knockout inhibits the activation of macrophage pyroptosis by NaCl
  through the MAPK/NF-κB pathway.
caption: 'SGK1 knockout inhibits the activation of macrophage pyroptosis by NaCl through
  the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. THP-1 cells were infected with lentivirus containing an
  SGK1 (LV-shSGK1) expression plasmid or an empty vector (LV-control) that confers
  resistance to puromycin. (a)The image of LV-control and LV-SGK1 group transfected
  for 72h and screened with puromycin (The lentivirus carries the EGFP label with
  green fluorescent) (Scale Bar: 200 μm). (b-c) RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis
  were performed on THP-1 cells with stable knock down of SGK1 expression (n=3). Data
  are expressed as the mean ± SD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01. (d-e) Representative western
  blot images of the effect of sodium chloride on the expression of pyroptosis related
  protein (d), NF-κB p65 and MAPK p38 (e). (f) The SoNa 520 AM system was used to
  detect macrophage Na+ influx in SGK1 knock down macrophages. (g) ELISA was used
  to detect SGK1 knock down on the effect of IL-1β and IL-18 in cell supernatant (n=6).
  (h) Effect of NaCl treatment on LDH release levels in culture supernatants of SGK1-deficient
  macrophages. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. **p<0.01, n=4'
