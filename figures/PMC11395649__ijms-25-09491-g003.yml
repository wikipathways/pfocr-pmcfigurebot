figure_title: Plant root and shoot defense initiation mechanism.
caption: 'Plant root and shoot defense initiation mechanism. (A) The mechanisms underlying
  induced systemic resistance (ISR) and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) involve
  distinct yet interconnected pathways. (B) Systemic acquired resistance represents
  an immune state established throughout the plant following local infection. SAR
  is primarily activated through the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, endowing
  the plant with enhanced resistance to subsequent pathogen infections. (C) Induced
  systemic resistance is an immune response triggered by beneficial microbes or chemical
  substances perceived by the plant’s roots. This response is activated through signaling
  pathways mediated by plant hormones such as jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET),
  strengthening the plant’s defense against a broad spectrum of pathogens. Abbreviations:
  EIN3, Ethylene Insensitive 3; JAZ, Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein; PAMPs, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns; PRRs, pattern recognition receptors; JA, jasmonic acid; ET,
  ethylene; PRs, pathogenesis-related proteins; SA, salicylic acid; NPR1, non-race-specific
