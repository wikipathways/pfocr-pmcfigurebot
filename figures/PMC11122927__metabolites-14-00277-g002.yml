caption: Pathologic model presenting oral dysbiosis and microbial metabolite with
  disturbed pathways influencing oral cancer development. In disease-free conditions,
  the oral microbial flora and their related biochemical pathways are in harmony to
  maintain a healthy oral environment. Disturbances in the host and oral microbiome
  can result in oral dysbiosis with disturbed biochemical pathways. Continued oral
  infection and oral dysbiosis affect the carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.
  The bacterial end-product in saliva as salivary metabolites can have carcinogenic
  effects, resulting in oral cancer
