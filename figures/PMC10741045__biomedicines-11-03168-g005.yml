caption: 'FNDC3B-related signaling pathway in GBM cells. (a) Network analysis results
  of FNDC3B and related genes using the MetaCore database, an integrated pathway bioinformatics
  analysis platform. A canonical pathway-based auto-expand building algorithm was
  used to analyze the network, which contained 50 nodes (green arrows: positive/activation
  effects; red arrows: negative/inhibition effects; gray arrows: unspecified). (b)
  The screening results of changes in phospho-protein activation in control and FNDC3B
  siRNA transfected U87MG cells were obtained using the proteome profiler phospho-kinase
  array. Chemiluminescence expression pixel densities were quantified with ImageJ
  software to analyze fold-changes in the proteins that showed alterations between
  the control group and the FNDC3B siRNA transfected group overall. (c) Phosphorylation
  and total expression of proteins, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3), total phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K), Akt, and c-Myc, were examined in both control and FNDC3B siRNA transfected
  U87MG cells'
