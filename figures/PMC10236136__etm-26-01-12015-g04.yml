caption: ETS1 is a target of miR-338-3p. (A) Pathway enrichment of miR-338-3p. (B)
  Bioinformatics prediction of the binding site of miR-338-3p to mRNA 3' untranslated
  region of ETS1 and ERK2. (C) miR-338-3p mimics, miR-338-3p mimics NC, miR-338-3p
  inhibitor or miR-338-3p inhibitor NC were transfected into BEAS-2B cells and mRNA
  levels of ETS1 were measured. (D) Expression of ETS1 in BEAS-2B cells transfected
  with miR-338-3p mimics was measured by western blotting. (E) Expression of ETS1
  in BEAS-2B cells transfected with siRNA targeting circDHTKD1 or its NC. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01. ETS1, E26 transformation specific-1; NC, negative control; si, small interfering;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; 3'UTR, 3' untranslated region; DHTKD1, dehydrogenase E1;
  circ, circular
