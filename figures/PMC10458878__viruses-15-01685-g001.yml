caption: Host derivation of virus influences transcriptional response in HEK-293 cells.
  Principal component analysis of RNA-Seq data set was generated using DESeq2 as described
  in Materials and Methods. (A) Volcano plot of the difference in log2 fold change
  in each gene differentially expressed following infection with either C7/10- or
  BHK-derived SINV compared to mock-infected cells is graphed with a cutoff of padj
  < 0.05. (B) Scatter plot of log2 fold change in C7/10-derived virus infection versus
  BHK-derived virus infection. C7/10-derived virus versus mock log2 fold change is
  graphed on the y-axis against log2 fold change in BHK-derived virus infection compared
  to mock on the x-axis. The IFNB1 (blue) gene as well as IFIT1 (red) and OASL (green)
  are highlighted. Cutoff was set at a padj < 0.05 when comparing the difference of
  BHK-derived DEGs from C7/10 DEGs. The black line represents the linear relationship
  of DEGs between the two virus infections such that DEGs that fall on the line are
  equally differentially expressed in both virus infections. (C) Differentially expressed
  genes from the RNA-Seq data which correspond to the Gene Ontology (GO) term “Regulation
  of Type I Interferon Mediated Signaling Pathway” were visualized using Cytoscape.
  Scale bar represents the difference in log2 fold change of C7/10-derived virus infection
  compared to BHK-derived virus infection
