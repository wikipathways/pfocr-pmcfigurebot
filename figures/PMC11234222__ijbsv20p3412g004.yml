figure_title: FGF23 upregulates AVIC pathobiological activities via activation of
  the FGFR/YAP signaling pathway.
caption: 'FGF23 upregulates AVIC pathobiological activities via activation of the
  FGFR/YAP signaling pathway. (A) Human AVICs from normal valves were pre-treated
  with global FGFR inhibitor PRN1371 (1.0 µM) for 2 hours, followed by treatment with
  FGF23 (40 ng/mL) for 72 hours. Representative immunoblots and densitometric data
  show that FGF23 induces the production of inflammatory, fibrogenic and osteogenic
  mediators in AVICs via FGFR. (B) Total RNA-sequencing was applied to analyze gene
  expression in AVICs incubated in the presence or absence of recombinant FGF23. The
  heat map illustrates diferent levels of gene expression, and the KEGG data show
  upregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway in FGF23-treated cells (significant
  enrichment at P < 0.05, Fisher''s exact test). (C) Cells were treated with recombinant
  FGF23 for different time. Representative immunoblots and densitometric data show
  that FGF23 induces YAP phosphorylation. (D) AVICs were treated with PRN1371 prior
  to FGF23 stimulation for 2 hours. Representative immunoblots and densitometric data
  show that global FGFR inhibitor suppresses FGF23-induced YAP phosphorylation. (F)
  Cells were treated with verteporfin (200 nM) for 2 hours prior to FGF23 stimulation.
  Representative immunoblots and densitometric data show that inhibition of YAP reduces
  inflammatory, fibrogenic, and osteogenic responses following FGF23 stimulation.
  Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SEM. n = 3 or 4 cell isolates from distinct
  donor valves in each group. *P < 0.05 versus control and #P < 0.05 versus FGF23
