figure_title: Regulation of macrophage activity by ZNFX1 and exploration of possible
  signaling mechanisms
caption: (A) Flow cytometry analysis of red fluorescence–positive WT and Znfx1–/–
  BMDMs infected with H37Rv carrying the red fluorescence protein (RFP) gene (i.e.,
  H37Rv-RFP) at MOI = 10 at 2 hpi (n = 3). (B) Flow cytometry analysis of green fluorescence–positive
  WT and Znfx1–/– BMDMs incubated with FITC-conjugated latex beads (n = 4). (C) CFU
  assays of intracellular M. tuberculosis levels in H37Rv-infected WT and Znfx1–/–
  BMDMs at MOI = 5 (n = 4). (D) Flow cytometry analysis of CD80, CD86, MHC-II, and
  CD206 expression on the surface of H37Rv-infected WT and Znfx1–/– BMDMs at MOI =
  2 at 24 hpi (n = 3). (E) Western blot assay of the regulatory effects of ZNFX1 on
  activation of signaling pathways following M. tuberculosis infection at MOI = 5.
  p-, phosphorylated. (F) Western blot assay of the regulatory effects of ZNFX1 on
  activation of the autophagy-associated mTOR signaling pathways. An unpaired 2-tailed
  t test (A and B) or a 2-way ANOVA with Holm-Šídák post hoc test (C–F) was used for
  statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SD and are representative of
  at least 3 experiments with similar observations. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P
  < 0.0001
