caption: PRL2 regulates Kit turnover in hematopoietic cells. A, Loss of Prl2 decreases
  Kit half-life in MCs. B, Kit ubiquitination in Prl2+/+ and PRL2−/− MCs stimulated
  with SCF. C, Kit is monoubiquitinated in MCs. D, CBL pathway and regulation of signaling
  by CBL were enriched in AML patients with high PRL2 expression compared to AML patients
  with low PRL2 expression. E, PRL2-CSDA show enhanced association with CBL and KIT
  compared to PRL2 in Kasumi-1 cells as determined by GST pull-down assays. G, Co-immunoprecipitation
  assays showed that PRL2 interacts with KIT and CBL in SKNO-1 cells. H, Overexpression
  of PRL2 increases the level of KIT in HEK293 cells. I, PRL2 interacts with CBL in
  HEK293 cells expressing KITD814V.

  through modulating CBL phosphorylation.
