caption: In the IPA data software the disease and function analysis of the RNA sequencing
  data from Primbio. Each one of these genes is known to be involved in cellular proliferation
  of breast cancer. These are the top three canonical pathway that are involved with
  cell proliferation with genes in common. The comparison of each gene and its known
  function is stated, in this case all the genes are decreasing cell proliferation
