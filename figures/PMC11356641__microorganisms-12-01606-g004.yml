figure_title: Signaling pathway involved in probiotics recognition.
caption: Signaling pathway involved in probiotics recognition. When bacterial structures
  are recognized by TLRs, a signaling cascade is activated. The recruitment of adaptor
  molecules such as MyD88 and TRAF6 leads to the activation of transcription factors
  belonging to MAPKs or NF-κB, resulting in changes in gene expression, including
  the production of molecular mediators such as cytokines
