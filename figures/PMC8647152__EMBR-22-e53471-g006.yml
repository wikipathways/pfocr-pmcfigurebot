figure_title: Computationally designed scaffolds present Ang1 F‐domain in wide range
  of geometries and valencies
caption: 'ADesigned F‐domain scaffold structures. Red and purple dots indicate N‐
  and C‐terminal sites of F‐domain conjugation, respectively. N is the maximum number
  of conjugated F‐domains, and the dashed lines are the distance between F‐domain
  conjugation sites. Top two rows: Cyclic homo‐oligomers. The trimeric nanocage subunits
  Icos1‐A, Tet1‐A, and Tet1‐A.2 allow precise testing of the effect of valency on
  signaling independent of geometry as they can be tested as trimers alone or as nanocages
  upon addition of the other component of these two‐component nanoparticles. C4 and
  AkC4 are tetrameric scaffolds, and H3, H6, and H8 are helical bundle scaffolds with
  nearly identical geometry but different valency. Third row: Tetrahedral nanoparticle
  scaffolds Tet1 and Tet2. Fourth row: Icosahedral nanoparticles. Icos1 and Icos2
  present sixty copies of the F‐domain on the trimer and pentamer subunits, respectively.BAverage
