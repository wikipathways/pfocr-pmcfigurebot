caption: BACE1 inhibitor treatment reduces the in vivo growth of TRAMP-C1 allografts
  in syngeneic murine model. (A) Schematic representation of the experimental design.
  TRAMP-C1 cells were engrafted bilaterally into the flanks of wild-type C57BL6 mice.
  After one week of engraftment, mice were treated with either vehicle control or
  MK-8931 (30 mg/kg, IP) for 5 weeks. (B,C) Animal body weight and tumor volume was
  measured over the course of the study. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Analysis
  was performed using multiple t-test analysis. Significant comparisons are outlined
  in dashed boxes for control versus MK-8931, p < 0.05. (D,E) Allografts were excised;
  volume (mm3) and weight (mg) were measured ex vivo. Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM. Analysis was performed using Student’s t-test. ** p = 0.019. (F) IHC analysis
  for PCNA expression in the tumor tissue of vehicle- and MK-8931 treated mice. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM. Analysis was performed using Student’s t-test. (G)
  Pathway analysis of genes related to mouse prostate cancer pathway. Data are presented
  as volcano plot; significantly altered genes are highlighted as purple solid circles
