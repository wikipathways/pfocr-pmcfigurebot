caption: 'Major pathways in which ABCA1 plays an important role for cholesterol transport
  in brains: (A) Reverse cholesterol transport pathway, (B) LXR/RXR pathway, and (C)
  SREBP2 pathway. In the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, free cholesterol is
  transported out of the macrophage to ApoA-1. ApoA-1 then becomes pre-B-HDL or nascent
  HDL. Nascent HDL then becomes mature HDL which is mediated by LCAT. LCAT then mediates
  cholesterol esterification of HDL into cholesterol ester (CE). The cholesterol esters
  are then taken up by SCARB1 receptors and taken up into hepatocytes. Cholesterol
  esters are then hydrolyzed to generate free cholesterol (FCh) in hepatocytes. In
  the LXR/RXR pathway, ligand LDL binds to receptor CD36, which oxidizes LDL into
  cholesterol esters. The cholesterol esters are converted into cholesterol, which
  is then converted into oxysterols. The oxysterols activate LXR/RXR, which then promotes
  cholesterol efflux from the nucleus, which then activates ABCA1 to transfer cholesterol
  out of the macrophage to Apo acceptors. In the SREBP2 pathway, SCAP transports SREBP2
  from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. SREBP2 is then translocated to the sterol regulatory
  element in the nucleus. Then miR-33a is co-transcribed with SREBP2, which inhibits
  ABCA1 activity. By inhibiting ABCA1, cholesterol efflux is hindered, therefore cholesterol
  accumulates. However, inhibiting miR-33a would activate ABCA1 and promote cholesterol
  efflux'
