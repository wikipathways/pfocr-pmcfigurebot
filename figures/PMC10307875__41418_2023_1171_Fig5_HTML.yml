figure_title: CircRILPL1 regulates NPC cells migration, invasion, proliferation and
  mechanical properties through YAP signaling
caption: Wound healing assay (A), transwell assay (B), MTT assay (C), and AFM assay
  (D–F) were performed to assess the effects of YAP on NPC cells migration, invasion,
  proliferation and biophysical properties that regulated by circRILPL1. All experiments
  were performed in at least triplicate samples. Data were presented as the means ± SD.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
