figure_title: Fam210a deletion leads to proteomic stress and elicits ISR signaling
caption: (A) PCA plot of the proteomics data from 6 weeks old mitochondria isolated
  from WT and Fam210aMKO muscle. (B) Volcano plot of the differentially expressed
  proteins in purified mitochondria from WT and Fam210aMKO mice muscle at 6 weeks
  of age. (C) Pathway analysis of the down-regulated and up-regulated biological pathways
  in the Fam210aMKO mitochondria. (D-F) Heatmaps of the differentially expressed proteins
  featuring cellular redox response pathway (D), mitochondrial organization/proteostasis
  pathway (E) and complex I assembly pathway (F). (G) Western blot analysis of the
  ISR pathway effector p-eIF2Î± in 4-week-old muscle from WT and Fam210aMKO. Quantification
  provided in the bar graph. (H) q-PCR analysis of the ISR pathway from 4-week-old
  muscle from WT and Fam210aMKO mice. (I) q-PCR analysis of the ISR pathway from 6-week-old
  muscle from WT and Fam210aMKO mice
