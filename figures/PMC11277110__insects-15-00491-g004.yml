caption: The signaling pathways regulated by miRNAs in wing development. (A) miR-5
  and miR-960 control the Hh signaling pathway by targeting specific signaling component
  genes. (B) miR-7 and miR-252 regulate the Notch signaling pathway. (C) miR-31a/b
  and miR-8 are involved in the Wg signaling pathway
