caption: Heatmap of DEGs in the (A) glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid metabolism
  pathway, (B) mTOR signaling pathway, (C) steriod biosynthesis, 20E and IH biosynthesis
  pathway, and (D) Toll and Imd signaling pathway. The expression levels of DEGs are
  highlighted in red (up-regulated) and blue (down-regulated)
