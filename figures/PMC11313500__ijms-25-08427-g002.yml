caption: Molecular pathway mechanisms of cytokines and chemokines associated with
  inflammation for the progression of pulmonary hypertension. TGF-β signaling pathway
  is divided into classical (Smad-dependent) and nonclassical (Smad-independent) pathways.
  After the ligands bind to the complex of type I and type II receptors, type II receptors
  induce phosphorylation of type I receptors, causing the recruitment of Smad. The
  signaling transduction is that Smad1/5/8 or Smad 2/3 translocates into the nucleus
  by forming a complex with Smad4. In the noncanonical way, TGF-β receptor complexes
  activate signals through other factors. IL-6 combines IL-6R (classic) or IL6R with
  soluble IL6R (trans) to mediate the activation of downstream pathways. Through the
  formation of the IL-1 and IL1R (IL1RI and IL-1R accessory protein) complexes, related
  pathways become active after interacting with MyD88. Certain chemokines participate
  in the relevant signal transduction by binding to corresponding receptors, such
  as CCL2/CCR2. Also, the involvement of TLR is regarded as an important factor. The
  downstream signaling pathways consisting of MAPK and Nf-κB contribute to life processes
  by regulating gene expression. The effects of these immune and inflammatory pathways
  on the pathogenesis of PH are of significance for targeted therapy and disease treatment
