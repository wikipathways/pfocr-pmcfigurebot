figure_title: Identifying biological pathways using individual subcellular image features
  in HeLa datasets
caption: (a) GO enrichment is found in many individual features in a manner that is
  fairly evenly distributed across the cellular structures (i.e. channels) imaged
  in PERISCOPE. Outer ring is the total number of features in our feature-selected
  dataset. Inner ring is the number of features that show GO enrichment. (b) GO enrichment
  in individual features is not distributed evenly across classes of features. Outer
  ring is the total number of features in our feature-selected dataset. Inner ring
  is the number of features that show GO enrichment. (c) Given gene groups whose protein
  products are expected to function specifically in a cellular structure imaged in
  PERISCOPE, are specifically enriched in hit lists for features in those compartments.
  Outer ring indicates the channel in which enrichment is expected. Inner ring is
  the breakdown of actual channels that show enrichment for the gene group. (d) Disruption
  of the Vacuolar ATPase (either V0 or V1 subunit) but not genes involved in its assembly
  causes a decrease in WGA signal in small structures as seen specifically with screen
  feature WGA_Granularity_1 but not larger granularities. Each trace is a single gene;
  those genes that are not hits in the screen are dashed. Bold lines are the mean
  of all genes in the group. (e) Loss of function in genes involved in N-Glycan synthesis
  in the Endoplasmic Reticulum but not in other organelles nor the GPI synthesis pathway
  causes an increase of ConA signal in small structures as seen specifically with
  screen feature ConA_Granularity_1 but not larger granularities
