caption: 'KJ-Pyr-9, OUL35, and CID44216842 effectively alleviate hE2A-PBX1-induced
  myeloid expansion in zebrafish larvae. (A) Flowchart illustrating the high-throughput
  drug screening process conducted in this study. Briefly, embryos were collected
  and subjected to a 1-hour heat shock at 12 hours post-fertilization (hpf), followed
  by twice daily 2-hour heat shocks from 1 to 3 days post-fertilization (dpf). Subsequently,
  zebrafish larvae were soaked in a solution containing small molecule compounds (initial
  screening concentration was 12 μM), the number of neutrophils was quantified using
  Sudan Black B (SB) staining at 6 dpf. (B) SB staining of sibling (left panel) and
  Tg(hsp70:E2A-PBX1-EGFP) (right panel) larvae after treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide
  (DMSO), 6.17 mM Ara-C (cytarabine), 8 μM KJ-Pyr-9, 20 μM CID44216842 and 24 μM of
  OUL35 at 6 dpf. (B’) Statistical analysis of the SB+ signals shown in panel (B).
  The black asterisks indicate statistical difference (N≥18, one-way ANOVA, mean ±
  standard error of the mean [SEM]; *P<0.05, ***P<0.001). (C) SB staining of hE2A-PBX1
  zebrafish larvae after inhibitors treatment (DMSO, 500 µM pomalidomide, 500 μM lenalidomide,
  and 0.75 μM Y-320 inhibitor, respectively). The caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT)
  is enlarged in the red box (original magnification ×200). (C’) Statistical analysis
  of the SB+ signals in panel (C). The black asterisks indicate statistical difference
  (N≥18, one-way ANOVA, mean ± SEM; **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001). (D) Real time quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis showing mRNA expression of mmp13, fosab,
  hsp27, junb, mmp9, and fosl1a in Tg(hsp70:E2A-PBX1-EGFP) compared to siblings after
  inhibitor treatment (one-way ANOVA, mean ± SEM; *P<0.05, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001).
  (E) Schematic representation of inhibitors targeting TNF/IL-17/MAPK signaling pathway.
  TNF: tumor necrosis factor; IL-17: interleukin-17; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein
  kinase. The AP-1 (activator protein 1) transcription factor is a dimeric complex
  that contains members of the JUN, FOS, ATF and MAF protein families.'
