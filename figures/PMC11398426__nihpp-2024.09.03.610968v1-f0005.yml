caption: CBFB loss induces a STING-TBK1-IRF3 cell-intrinsic ISG response(a) Schematic
  of the type I IFN signalling pathway. Aberrant or foreign nucleic acids are detected
  by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which signal through adaptor proteins to
  stimulate TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3. IRF3 heterodimers translocate to
  the nucleus to trigger transcription of IFNs and a subset of ISGs. Secreted IFNs
  act through IFNAR receptors to promote STAT1- and STAT2-mediated ISG expression.(b)
  qPCR analysis of IFIT1 expression in 786O Cas9 cells transduced with a vector encoding
  sgRNAs targeting both STAT1 (sg1) and STAT2 (sg2), or an empty vector control. Cells
  were additionally transduced with CBF-β sg2, or treated with 10 IU/ml IFN-β for
  6 hours. n=3 biologically independent replicates. Mean ± SD. Two-way ANOVA.(c) ISG
  expression is dependent on IRF3. qPCR analysis of cells transduced with sgRNAs targeting
  CBF-β (sg2), IRF3 and IRF7, or an empty vector control. n=3 biologically independent
  replicates. Mean ± SD. Two-way ANOVA.(d) Cells were transduced with CBF-β sg2 or
  an empty vector control, and treated with 5 μM GSK8612 for 24 hours (to inhibit
  TBK1), as indicated. Immunoblot representative of 3 biologically independent replicates.(e)
  786O Cas9 cells were transduced with CBF-β sg2 or an empty vector control, treated
  for 24 hours with the indicated doses of the TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612, the NF-κB inhibitor
  BAY 11–7085, or the DMSO vehicle, and analysed by qPCR. n=3 biologically independent
  replicates. Mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA.(f) CBF-β loss specifically activates STING.
  qPCR analysis of cells transduced with CBF-β sg2 alone or in combination with sgRNAs
  targeting the PRR adaptors TRIF, MAVS and STING, compared to an empty vector-transduced
  control. n=3 biologically independent replicates. Mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA.(g) Immunoblot
  of 786O Cas9 cells transduced with sgRNAs targeting CBF-β (sg2) and STING (sg1),
  or an empty vector control. Representative of 3 biologically independent replicates.(h)
  Dose-response relationship between IFN-β treatment and cell proliferation over 72
  hours in 786O Cas9 cells and proximal tubule HK2 Cas9 cells. n=6 biologically independent
  replicates. Mean ± SD
