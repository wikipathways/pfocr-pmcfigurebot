caption: Analysis of serum metabolic profiles at baseline between the remission and
  non-remission groups. Comparison of the baseline serum metabolome (positive mode)
  of UC patients based on OPLS–DA among the remission and non-remission groups (a).
  Volcano plots of differential metabolites (positive mode) between the remission
  and non-remission groups; gray dots represent metabolites with no significant change,
  red dots represent up-regulated metabolites, and blue dots represent down-regulated
  metabolites (b). The top 25 enriched metabolite sets based on main class are listed
  in (c). Bubble diagram of metabolic pathway enrichment based on the differential
  metabolites between the remission and non-remission groups at baseline (d). OPLS–DA,
  orthogonal partial least squares–discriminant analysis
