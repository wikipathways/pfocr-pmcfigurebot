  cells.
caption: GA treatment activated necroptosis signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells.
  AGS and HGC27 cells were treated with 2 µmol/L GA for 24 hours. The treated cells
  were washed and harvested in lysis buffer. Western blot was used to detect the phosphorylation
  of each indicated necroptosis-related protein. (a) Schematic cartoon showing activation
  of necroptosis. (b) Phosphorylation of indicated necroptosis-associated proteins.
  (c) Coimmunoprecipitation assay. 1 mg total cell lysate of each indicated sample
  was used to perform the coimmunoprecipitation assay. 5 μg RIPK3 antibody for each
  sample was used to do the assay. RIPK1, RIPK3, phospho-RIPK3, and MLKL were detected
  by western blot with corresponding antibodies. (d) Phosphorylation of Drp-1
