caption: 'Proposed Rearticulation of the Mechanism for Radiation-Induced Fibrosis:
  Initial radiation exposure initiates at least three distinct pathways. First, radiation
  directly compromises DNA integrity, manifesting as single-stranded breaks (SSBs).
  Second, the radiolytic decomposition of water generates ROS, which further exacerbates
  DNA damage through the formation of double-stranded breaks (DSBs), thereby disrupting
  cellular functionality. Third, radiation injures tissues, prompting an upsurge in
  the expression of ANG II, AT1R, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
  oxidase (NOX 1–5), and dual oxidases 1/2 (DUOX1/2), leading to an augmented ROS
  production. These mechanistic pathways collectively escalate cytokine levels, a
  condition termed hypercytokinemia. Without resolution, this state progresses to
  chronic inflammation and, ultimately, to fibrosis. Neu—neutrophils; Mono—monocytes'
