  through ROS/YAP signaling pathway.
caption: NOX4 affects glycolysis, proliferation, and migration of breast cancer through
  ROS/YAP signaling pathway. (A) After the application of N-acetyl cysteine (a ROS
  scavenger), the increase of glycolysis caused by NOX4 overexpression was blocked.
  (B) Following treatment with Peptide17 (YAP inhibitor), the increase in glycolysis
  caused by NOX4 overexpression was blocked. (C) The 18F-FDG uptake rate of cells
  was significantly decreased following exposure to N-acetyl cysteine and Peptide17.
  (D) CCK8 assay results showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited
  after exposure to N-acetyl cysteine and Peptide17. (E) EDU assay results showed
  that the cell proliferation was significantly reduced after the application of N-acetyl
  cysteine and Peptide17. (F) The migration experiment results showed that cell migration
  was significantly reduced after the application of N-acetyl cysteine and Peptide17.
