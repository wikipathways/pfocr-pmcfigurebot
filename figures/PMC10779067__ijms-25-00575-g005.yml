figure_title: Effect of HY7718 on the expression of genes in the colon of DSS-induced
  colitis mice.
caption: 'Effect of HY7718 on the expression of genes in the colon of DSS-induced
  colitis mice. Expression of genes related to the TLR/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway:
  (A) Tlr4, (B) MyD88, (C) Nfκb1, and (D) Tlr2. The results are presented as the mean
  ± SD. Significant differences are indicated as ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001 compared
  to the control group and * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared to
  the DSS group. DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; SULF, sulfasalazine; HY7718, Lactiplantibacillus
  plantarum HY7718; ATCC 14917, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ATCC 14917; Tlr4, toll-like
  receptor 4; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; Nfκb1, nuclear factor
  kappa subunit; Tlr2, toll-like receptor 2'
