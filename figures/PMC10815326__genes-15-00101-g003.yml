caption: Gene set enrichment analysis of the Biocarta NF-kB pathway. Gene set enrichment
  analysis of the NF-kB signaling pathway shows no significant difference between
  tissues both in Npc1−/− mice and wildtype controls (A,C). Genotype comparison within
  tissues, on the other hand, shows that the NF-kB pathway gene set is significantly
  enriched in the cerebellum of Npc1−/− mice (B) but not in the cerebral cortex (D),
  compared to wildtype controls. ES = enrichment score; NES = normalized enrichment
  score; FDR-q = false discovery rate q value
