figure_title: Measured and inferred function of the fecal microbiota post LPS challenge.
caption: 'Measured and inferred function of the fecal microbiota post LPS challenge.
  (a–d). Fecal SCFAs. (a). Total SCFAs, (b). acetate, (c). propionate, (d). butyrate
  (n = 10–12/group). (e–g). Inferred function of the fecal microbiota (e). LPS biosynthesis,
  (f). PPAR signalling pathway, (g). membrane transport (n = 23–24/group). Bars that
  share letters are not significantly different. BD: basal diet. FS: flaxseed; FO:
  FS oil; LPS: Lipopolysaccharides; Sal: saline'
