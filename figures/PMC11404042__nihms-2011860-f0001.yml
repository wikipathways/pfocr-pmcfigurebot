figure_title: PBMC transcriptomic analysis of pre-vaccination of Butantan-DV/TV-003
  vaccine-induced breadth of the neutralizing response reveals a dichotomic association
  of pro- versus anti-inflammatory pathways
caption: (A) Design of phase II Butantan-DV/TV-003 clinical trial in naive subjects,
  with one primary injection at day 0 and a second dose at day 180. PBMCs were collected
  at days 0, 6, and 15, and plasma was collected at day 0.(B) UpSet plot of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs; p < 0.05) at the pre-vaccination time point associated with
  post-vaccination outcomes. Each row represents an outcome, with the number of DEGs
  at the far right. Genes positively and negatively associated with each outcome are
  indicated in red and blue, respectively. Bar plots above indicate the number of
  DEGs in common across selected outcomes. Degrees indicate the number of outcomes
  included in each intersection.(C and D) Heatmaps representing pathway EnrichmentMap
  analysis for immune (C) and metabolic (D) transcriptomic gene sets, where each row
  represents a pathway module and columns represent individual participants. Column
  annotation tracks (top) represent the breadth per participant. The dataset contains
  8 and 24 biological replicates for low and high breadth, respectively.(E) Cartoon
  depicting the association of breadth correlates for low (left) and high (right)
  breadth
