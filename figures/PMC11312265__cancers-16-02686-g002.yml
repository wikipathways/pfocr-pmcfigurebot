figure_title: Signaling cascade of non-canonical Wnt/PCP and Wnt/Ca2+ pathway.
caption: Signaling cascade of non-canonical Wnt/PCP and Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. The Wnt/PCP
  is activated upon specific Wnt ligand binding to several transmembrane receptors
  including ROR1/2, RYK, PTK7, and Frizzled. This results in the activation of several
  GTPases through direct interaction with the Dvl/Daam1/WGEF complex (Roh), with the
  Dvl/Daam1 complex (Profilin, PI3K), or with Dvl (Rac1) alone. Activated GTPases
  either induce formation, polymerization, or reorganization of the cytoskeleton.
  Wnt/Ca2+ signaling is activated upon binding of specific Wnt ligands to the corresponding
  Frizzled receptor. IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ ions from the endoplasmic reticulum
  into the cytosol positively modulates the kinase activity of PKC which in turn phosphorylates
  and activates Cdc42. Cdc42 and CamKII together phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPK.
  Activated p38 MAPK and Ca2+-dependent activation of calcineurin are essential for
  the phosphorylation and activation of NFAT [44]. NF-κB is also a direct target of
  MAP kinases that phosphorylate and activate it. Transcriptional activation of both,
  NFAT and NF-κB regulate tissue separation and ventral fate during embryogenesis.
  On the other hand, Ca2+ release is also responsible for CamKII activation. In a
  subsequent phosphorylation cascade, activated TAK and NLK prevent the assembly of
  β-catenin and TCF/LEF, thus, inhibiting the β-mediated transcriptional activation
  of downstream genes. Black arrows indicate the activation of the respective downstream
  proteins within the Wnt-signaling cascade. Green arrows indicate transcriptional
  activation of genes. Red “inhibition” arrow indicated the inhibition of proteins.
