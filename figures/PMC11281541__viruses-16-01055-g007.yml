figure_title: Evaluation of the effects of MIN on regulating calcium signaling pathway
  in TBEV-infected Vero cells.
caption: 'Evaluation of the effects of MIN on regulating calcium signaling pathway
  in TBEV-infected Vero cells. (A) RT-qPCR of RNA levels of TBEV RNA. (B,C) RT-qPCR
  of mRNA levels of CALML4 RYR2, and SNAP25. The difference between the two groups
  was analyzed using an independent sample t-test, compared with the TBEV group, it
  was expressed by “*”, * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01), and *** (p < 0.001), and compared
  with the Vero cells group, it was expressed by “#”, ### (p < 0.001), the ns symbol
  represented no significant difference'
