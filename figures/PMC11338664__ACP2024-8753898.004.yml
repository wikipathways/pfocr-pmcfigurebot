caption: SWT alleviated H/R-induced ferroptosis in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. (a–c) SWT
  alleviated H/R-induced ferroptosis in H9c2 cardiomyocytes via the xCT/GPX4 signaling
  pathway. Expression levels of GPX4 and xCT were shown by Western blot in the NC,
  NC + SWT, H/R, and HR + SWT groups (n = 3). (d) Effect of SWT on mitochondrial morphology
  of H9c2 cardiomyocytes by transmission electron microscopy in the NC, NC + SWT,
  H/R, and H/R + SWT groups. The scales in the photographs represent 100 μm (n = 3).
  Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM.  ∗∗P < 0.01,  ∗∗∗P < 0.001 vs. NC
