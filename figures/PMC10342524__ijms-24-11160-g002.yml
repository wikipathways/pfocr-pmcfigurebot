caption: Bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptome sequencing results of tissues.
  (A) Schematic diagram of the RNA-seq and biochemical analysis process. (B) Using
  a volcano plot, we identify the genes that are differentially expressed between
  the control and NB groups. (C) The NF-κB pathway, epithelial cell differentiation,
  and ECM were shown to be abundant in the DEGs of tissues according to GO and KEGG
  analyses (the red underline indicates the focus of attention). (D) Potential enhancement
  of EMT, the NF-κB pathway, and the inflammatory response in tissues was examined
  using GSEA
