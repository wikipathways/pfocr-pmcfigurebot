figure_title: Short-term metformin treatment is sufficient to decrease fructose catabolism
  in the intestinal tissue and fructose delivery to the liver
caption: (A) Diagram showing the fructose catabolism pathways within enterocytes.
  (B) Relative quantity of fructose 1-phosphate, and enrichment of (C) glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate, and (D) glycerate in the intestinal tissue 30 minutes after fructose
  gavage in mice treated with water versus metformin for 2 weeks. (E) Absolute fructose
  levels measured in the portal blood. (F) Relative quantification of fructose 1-phosphate
  and (G) glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the liver tissue after fructose gavage. 0.1
  nmol M6-Fructose 6-phosphate and 4 nmol M2-fructose were used as internal standard
  for the measurement of fructose 1-phosphate and fructose respectively. Norvaline
  was used as the internal standard for the measurement of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,
  and glycerate. Data represent means ± SEM. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001. Analysis
  performed via paired student-t test
