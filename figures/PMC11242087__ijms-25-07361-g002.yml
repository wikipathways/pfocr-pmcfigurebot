caption: The morphology of testes after interfering or inhibiting ERK, JNK and p38
  MAPK in vivo. (A) H&E staining results showing interference of the MAPK signaling
  pathway; (a,c) enrichment of spermatozoa in the control and dsJNK groups (red arrows
  pointed to the mature sperm); (b,d) loss of mainly mature sperm (red arrows pointed
  to the few mature sperm); (a′) regular germ cells in the control group (red arrows
  pointed to the early germ cells in germinal zones); and (b′–d′) irregular germinal
  zone in the dsMAPK groups (red arrows pointed to the early germ cells in germinal
  zones). (B) H&E staining results showing the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway;
  (a,c) spermatozoa enriched in the DMSO and SP600125 groups (red arrows pointed to
  the mature sperm); (b,d) lost mainly mature sperm (red arrows pointed to the few
  mature sperm); (a′) regular germ cells in the control group (red arrows pointed
  to the early germ cells in germinal zones); and (b′–d′) irregular germinal zones
  in the inhibit-MAPK groups (red arrows pointed to the early germ cells in germinal
  zones). (C,D) The area ratio of mature sperm to the evacuation zone of (A) and (B),
  respectively. The scale bars are 100 μm in (A,B). **** p < 0.0001 indicate an extremely
  significant difference. ‘ns’ indicates that there was no significant change
