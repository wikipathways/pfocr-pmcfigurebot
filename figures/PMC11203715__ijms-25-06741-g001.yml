caption: Using KEGG data, a Sankey Plot depicts the association between MS-related
  genes and signaling pathways. On the right side of the figure, there are 25 genes
  and 21 signaling pathways, with gray lines representing their relationships. The
  dot plot on the left side of the image displays the false discovery rate (FDR) on
  the X-axis. The color of the points is indicative of the p-value, normalized with
  âˆ’log10, and the size of the circles corresponds to the number of genes present in
  the signaling pathway (Count)
