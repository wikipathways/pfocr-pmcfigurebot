figure_title: TRIM14 potentially activates the JAK-STAT pathway in HCC.
caption: TRIM14 potentially activates the JAK-STAT pathway in HCC. (A) Gene function
  enrichment analysis was performed, and KEGG pathways that are associated with TRIM14
  are shown. (B) The JAK−STAT signaling pathway was positively related to TRIM14.
  (C,D) The relationship of STAT3 and HIF-1A with TRIM14 in LIHC was analyzed in GEPIA
