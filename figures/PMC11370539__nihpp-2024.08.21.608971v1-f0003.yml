figure_title: Mapping of intercellular molecular signaling post-stroke
caption: '(A) Schematic of cell-cell interaction analysis (B) Bar plot showing number
  and strength of interactions in cells from intact, ibz and stroke tissue. (C) Network
  diagram contrasting total number of cell-cell interactions between individual cell
  types in stroke vs intact (left) and ibz vs intact (right). Red lines indicate increased
  interaction, blue lines indicate reduced interaction, relative to intact tissue.
  (D) Hierarchy plot of interaction between all individual cell types to target cells
  in stroke (left), ibz (middle) and intact (right) datasets. (E) Heatmap showing
  differential interactions between cell types from stroke vs intact (upper) and ibz
  vs intact tissue (lower). Red squares indicating increased signaling and blue squared
  indicating decreased signaling, relative to cells from intact tissue. (F) Scatter
  plot projecting signaling groups onto a 2D space according to their functional similarity
  between cells from stroke and intact tissue. (G) Bar plot showing signaling pathway
  distance between stroke and intact tissue (H) Stacked bar plot illustrating the
  proportional relative information flow in signaling pathways between intact and
  stroke tissue. (I) Cell-cell communication networks for selected pathways: COLLAGEN,
  Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor (PTPR), and Pleiotrophin (PTN) across cell
  types in intact (left) and stroke (right) tissue. (J) Chord diagrams showing the
  most upregulated signaling ligand-receptor pairings in injury-associated cells (IC),
  fibroblasts (FB), astrocytes (Asc), and pericytes (Per)'
