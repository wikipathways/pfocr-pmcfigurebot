caption: CellChat investigates intercellular communication networks among different
  cell types. Spatial transcriptomics identifies intercellular communication within
  ovarian tissue and evaluates variations in signaling pathways related to SEMA3 (A),
  VEGF (B), BMP (C), ANGPTL (D) and, across different cell types, along with network
  centrality scores
