figure_title: Differential gene expression in CD31+ vascular ECs from Tbx4LME-Cre
  Tsc2KO mouse lung
caption: '(A) Representative images of immunofluorescence staining of distal lung
  demonstrate pS6 positivity, a marker of mTORC1 upregulation (green) in PDGFRα (red)
  mesenchymal cells of 8-week-old Tbx4LME-Cre Tsc2KO (Tsc2KO) mouse lungs. Scale bars:
  50 μm. (B) Immunoblot of Tsc2 and pS6 protein expression in Tsc2WT (n = 3 in duplicates)
  and Tsc2KO (n = 3 in duplicates) lung fibroblasts from 12-week-old mice. (C) Densitometric
  analysis of Tsc2 and pS6 levels normalized to β-actin in each lane with average
  levels in Tsc2WT fibroblasts taken as 1. (D) Immunoblot of Tsc2 expression in lung
  ECs from 8-week-old Tsc2WT (n = 3) and Tsc2KO (n = 3) mice. (E) Densitometric analysis
  of Tsc2 normalized to β-actin in each lane, with the average expression levels in
  Tsc2WT set as 1. (F) Heatmap of the top differentially expressed genes in lung ECs
  isolated from Tsc2WT (n = 3) and Tsc2KO (n = 3) mice. (G) qPCR of Wnt pathway activation
  of Axin2, ligands, and receptors in lung ECs from 8-week-old Tsc2WT (n = 3) and
  Tsc2KO (n = 3) mice. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001, by 2-tailed t test'
