figure_title: The proposed mechanism for the regulation of NRAS mutation-driven hematopoietic
  malignancies involves the CBL/JAK2/RAB27B signaling axis
caption: Deletion or loss-of-function mutations of CBL stabilize JAK2, leading to
  upregulation of the transcription of RAB27B. RAB27B facilitates NRAS trafficking
  to the plasma membrane and regulates its palmitoylation, thereby activating the
  RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and promoting leukemogenesis
