caption: Revised model of regulation of lens hydrostatic pressure by zonular tension.
  A simplifed model showing only the TRPV1-mediated arm of the dual feedback system
  that regulates hydrostatic pressure in the lens. In this model, pilocarpine-induced
  decrease in the zonular tension applied to the lens activates a TRPV1-mediated signalling
  pathway that immediately increases the activity of NKCC to increase the uptake of
  ions and, after a delay, reduces the activity of NaKATPase to reduce the removal
  of ions from surface fiber cells and affect the intracellular accumulation of ions.
  In parallel to these changes in ion transporter activity, the removal of AQP5 from
  the membrane in the anterior influx pathway and equatorial efflux zone by TRPV1
  activation specifically reduces PH2O in these regions of the lens. These changes
  in transporter activity and PH2O combine to increase the intracellular osmolartity
  and, in turn, the hydrostatic pressure gradient. Futhermore, based on the observed
  ability of hyperosmotic challenge to increase NKCC1 activity via a TRPV1-mediated
  signalling pathway [20], we would predict that hyperosmotic challenge would also
  modulate AQP5 membrane trafficking
