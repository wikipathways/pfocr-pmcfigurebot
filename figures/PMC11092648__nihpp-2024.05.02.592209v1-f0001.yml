figure_title: Expression patterns of Eiger, Wgn, and Grnd in mosquitoes
caption: (A) Schematic representation of the mosquito TNF signaling pathway. The expression
  of Eiger (B), Wgn (C), and Grnd (D) was examined by qPCR in the mosquito midgut,
  hemolymph, and fat body under naive, blood-fed (24h post-feeding) or P. berghei-infected
  (24h post-infection) conditions. Expression data are displayed relative to rpS7
  expression with bars representing the mean Â± SE of three to six independent biological
  replicates (black dots). Data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with a Tukey's
  multiple comparisons test to determine significance. Asterisks denote significance
  (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01)
