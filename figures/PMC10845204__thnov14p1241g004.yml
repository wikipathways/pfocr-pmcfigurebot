figure_title: S100a9hi macrophages release Tgf-β to promote fibroblast activation
  into myofibroblasts, facilitating fibrotic remodeling.
caption: S100a9hi macrophages release Tgf-β to promote fibroblast activation into
  myofibroblasts, facilitating fibrotic remodeling. (A) Focused Monocle trajectory
  analysis including monocyte-derived infiltrated macrophages in day 7 after MIR.
  (B) GO richment pathway analysis of gene in the Arg-1hi and Col1α1hi macrophages
  with MetaboAnalyst 5.0. (C-D) Representative images of Masson staining of heart
  sections on day 7 after MIR and quantitative analysis in each group. n = 5. * P
  < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared to WT-MIR, Student's t test. (E-F) Western blots of
  heart α-SMA, Tgf-β and the quantification of expression on day 7 after MIR and Sham
  group. n = 5 in each group. ns, no significance, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared
  to WT-MIR group, one-way ANOVA. (G) Representative immunofluorescence images of
  iNos and CD68, as well as Arg-1 and CD68 co-staining of day 7 post-MIR in heart
  tissues. n = 5. All scale bar, 50 μm. (H-I) Western blots of Tgf-β and the quantification
  of expression of macrophage treated with IL-4 or not. n = 5 in each group. ns, no
  significance, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared to WT-MIR, one-way ANOVA. (J-L) Representative
  immunofluorescence images of Col1α1 and α-SMA co-staining and quantitative analysis
  of releasing Col1α1 level in each group. n = 5. ns, no significance, * P < 0.05,
  ** P < 0.01 compared to WT-BMDMs, one-way ANOVA. All scale bar, 50 μm. (M-N) Western
  blots of Arg-1 and the quantification of expression in each group. n = 5 in each
  group. ns, no significance, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared to WT-MIR, one-way
  ANOVA
