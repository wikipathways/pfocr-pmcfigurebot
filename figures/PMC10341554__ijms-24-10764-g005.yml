  blot analysis of total AKT and ERK and of the phosphorylated forms 24 h after treatment
  with trametinib (MEKi), GDC0941 (PI3Ki) and dabrafenib (BRAFi) in TPC-1 and BCPAP
  cells.
caption: 'HMGA2 expression is regulated by the MAPK signalling pathway (a) Western
  blot analysis of total AKT and ERK and of the phosphorylated forms 24 h after treatment
  with trametinib (MEKi), GDC0941 (PI3Ki) and dabrafenib (BRAFi) in TPC-1 and BCPAP
  cells. Right panel: Quantification of the phosphorylated forms according to the
  different treatments. * p < 0.05 ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 vs. DMSO. (b) HMGA2
  mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR in TPC-1 and BCPAP cells treated with different
  inhibitors during 24 h: trametinib (MEKi), GDC0941 (PI3Ki), dabrafenib (BRAFi),
  trametinib and dabrafenib (MEKi + BRAFi), BMS-754807 (IGF1Ri) (NT: non treated cells).
  DMSO treatment was used as a negative control. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 and *** p
  < 0.001 vs. DMSO'
