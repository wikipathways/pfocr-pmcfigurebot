caption: Hierarchical clustering of the differential metabolites (pre- vs. post-FMT)
  in the four groups (aâ€“c). The color indicates the fold change (FC) of metabolites
  after FMT in this group of samples, red indicates up-regulated and blue indicates
  down-regulated. Differential metabolites (pre- vs. post-FMT) shared in the response
  and remission groups (a). Differential negative (b) and positive metabolites (c)
  shared in the non-response and non-remission groups. Pathway and enrichment analyses
  of differential metabolites (pre- vs. post-FMT) shared in the response and remission
  groups (d)
