figure_title: Alkaloids targeting autophagy in thyroid cancer.
caption: Alkaloids targeting autophagy in thyroid cancer. Autophagy, literally “self-digestion”,
  is essential for cell homeostasis. It suppresses tumor cell growth by degrading
  damaged mitochondria and proteins or inducing cell death. Aloperine, Berberine and
  Halofunginone promote autophagy via inhibition of and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  leading to tumoral cell death. Capsaicin promotes the degradation of OCT4a, a cell
  stemness regulator
