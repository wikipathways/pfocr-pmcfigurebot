caption: 'Immune system-related gene ontology (GO) terms are enriched among transcripts
  increased in anxiety and decreased under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions in adult
  zebrafish. (A) PCA of transcripts from young adult zebrafish brains: AB—low anxiety;
  SB (HS and LS)—high anxiety. (B) PCA of transcripts from telencephalons of young
  adult zebrafish fed HFD or SD. (C) A total of 107 transcripts were commonly differentially
  expressed (DE) (padj < 0.05) in anxiety (red) and HFD (yellow) in adult zebrafish.
  (D) Heatmap of the 27 transcripts upregulated (>1.5) in anxiety among the DE (padj
  < 0.05) intersecting genes in zebrafish adults; AB—low anxiety, SB—high anxiety.
  (E) Overrepresented Panther GO-slim biological processes (BP) common in upregulated
  anxiety and downregulated HFD genes in zebrafish adults. (F) Overrepresented Reactome
  Pathways common to upregulated anxiety and downregulated HFD genes in zebrafish
  adults. Reference transcripts were all found in the Danio rerio database, Fisher’s
  exact test, and correction by FDR < 0.05'
