  lonp-1 mutants.
caption: The MAD pathway does not mediate activation of the MAPKmt pathway in lonp-1
  mutants. (A) Representative microscopy images and GFP fluorescence quantification
  of the tbb-6p::gfp reporter in 1-day adults of wt, cdc-48.2(tm659), lonp-1(ko) and
  lonp-1(ko);cdc-48.2(tm659), at 20 °C. (B) Relative mRNA quantification of endogenous
  tbb-6 gene expression levels in 1-day adults of the aforementioned strains, grown
  on NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 or with E. coli HT115 bacteria transformed
  with the cdc-48.1(RNAi) construct (and empty vector as control), at 20 °C. Scale
  bar indicate 100 µm. Values were presented as mean ± SEM, and numeric data were
  analyzed with a two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s test, showing no significant
  (ns) differences
