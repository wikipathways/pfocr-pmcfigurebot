caption: GO and KEGG analysis of 80 common genes. (A) A bubble chart of top 20 enriched
  GO items of potential targets in the molecular function. (B) Bubble chart of top
  20 KEGG signaling pathways related to the effect of Lut against ALI. The redder
  the bubble, the smaller the P-value; the larger the bubble, the greater the number
  of genes that participated in this pathway. (C) The critical signaling pathway target
  visualization network. PPI network of the top 20 KEGG signaling pathways and associated
  target genes. Red nodes represent top 20 KEGG pathways, and blue nodes indicate
  the genes that participated
