caption: Renoprotective effects of melatonin and zileuton in the UUO mouse model.
  (A) Expression levels of ferroptosis-related proteins (4-HNE, 5-LOX, and GPX4) in
  kidney tissue were determined by immunohistochemistry. (B) Expression levels of
  fibrosis-related proteins including α-SMA and fibronectin in kidney tissue were
  confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Sirius red staining. (C) Expression levels
  of AKT/mTOR/NRF2 signaling pathway-related proteins in kidney tissue were determined
  by immunohistochemistry. Data are presented as means ± SD (*p<0.05, **p<0.01 and
  ***p<0.001). Scale bar=50 μm
