figure_title: PDCD4 knockdown inhibits KA-induced oxidative stress of HT22 cells by
  blocking the MAPK/NF-κB pathway.
caption: 'PDCD4 knockdown inhibits KA-induced oxidative stress of HT22 cells by blocking
  the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. (A) Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining was used
  to assess reactive oxygen species levels. Original magnification, x200. (B) Levels
  of MDA, SOD and GSH-Px were detected using kits. Data are presented as the means
  ± SD. ***P<0.001 vs. Control; ###P<0.001 vs. KA + sh-NC; $$$P<0.001 vs. KA + sh-PDCD4.
  GSH-Px, glutathione peroxidase; KA, kainic acid; MDA, malondialdehyde; NC, negative
  control; PDCD4, human programmed cell death 4; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; sh,
  short hairpin; SOD, superoxide dismutase'
