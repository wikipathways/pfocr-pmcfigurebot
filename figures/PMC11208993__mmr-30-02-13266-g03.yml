figure_title: BMSC-Exo-25-3p alleviated H/R-induced injury in H9C2 cells.
caption: 'BMSC-Exo-25-3p alleviated H/R-induced injury in H9C2 cells. (A) Phagocytosis
  of Dil-labeled BMSC-Exo in H9C2 cells observed by a confocal microscope (scale bar,
  50 µm). (B) Expression of miR-25-3p in H9C2 cells after co-incubation assessed by
  RT-qPCR. (C) Expression of miR-25-3p in H/R-induced injury in H9C2 cells. (D) LDH
  and (E) CK activity in cell culture supernatant. (F) Representative western blotting
  images of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Quantity analysis of (G) p-JAK2 and
  (H) p-STAT3 in H9C2 cells. **P<0.01, *P<0.05 vs. control group. ##P<0.01, #P<0.05
  vs. H/R + PBS group. ▽P<0.05 vs. H/R + BMSC-Exo group. &P<0.01 vs. PBS group, BMSC-Exo
  group or BMSC-Exo-NC group. All data were presented as mean ± SD. Exo, exosome;
  BMSC, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; NC, negative control; H/R, hypoxia/reoxygenation;
  LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; CK, creatine kinase; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; p-, phosphorylated;
  STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3'
