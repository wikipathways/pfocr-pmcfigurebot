caption: (a) The expression levels of osteogenic-related genes of rBMMSCs detected
  by PCR. The expression levels of RUNX2 and ALP proteins of rBMMSCs after CGRP stimulation
  detected by western blot; (b) expression levels of Wnt pathway-related genes and
  proteins in rBMMSCs treated with CGRP. The gene expression of Wnt6 and β-catenin
  by PCR ( ∗p < 0.05). Expression levels of Wnt6, β-catenin protein, and β-actin proteins
  by western blot; (c) western blot showing the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK pathway
  components in rBMMSCs treated with CGRP;  ∗p < 0.05
