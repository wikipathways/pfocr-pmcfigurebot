figure_title: Canonical pathway analysis of DEGs after overexpression of HOXD10 in
  EOC cells.
caption: 'Canonical pathway analysis of DEGs after overexpression of HOXD10 in EOC
  cells. (A) The top 10 canonical pathways derived from the ingenuity pathway analysis
  (IPA). (B) The visual network of pathway interactions among genes. The relevant
  network among oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria dysfunction, granzyme A signaling
  pathway genes is shown, and sirtuin signaling pathway. (C) qPCR analysis of HOXD10,
  NDUFA7, UQCRB and CCL2 after transfection of TOV21G, TOV112D, JHOC5 and OVK18 cells
  with HOXD10 plasmid. Expression is shown relative to the control *P < 0.05. HD,
  HOXD10 transfection; ND, control plasmid. Data are presented as the mean Â± SD. Blue
  bars: negative z-score; orange bars: positive z-score; gray bars: no activity pattern
