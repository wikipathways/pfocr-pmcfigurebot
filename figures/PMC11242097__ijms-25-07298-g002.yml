figure_title: Differentially expressed genes and enriched biological pathways at different
  MCL stages.
caption: 'Differentially expressed genes and enriched biological pathways at different
  MCL stages. (A) Bar chart summarizing the number of identified DEGs at each stepwise
  MCL stage comparison, including normal (N) to any other MCL stage transitions. Results
  of the comparative analysis between healthy and typical MCL patients (HtoMCLx),
  normal B cells and newly diagnosed MCL patients (BtoMCL(e)), normal B cells and
  progressed-MCL-stage patients (BtoMCL), and newly diagnosed and progressed-MCL-stage
  patients (MCL(e)toMCL) are also depicted. Differentially expressed transcripts are
  also colored based on their type (blue: protein coding, gray: pseudogenes, green:
  asRNAs, red: lncRNAs, yellow: ncRNAs and orange: snoRNA). The overlap between the
  different sets of DEGs is represented in the form of Venn diagrams at the top of
  the bar chart. (B) Heatmap of 168 enriched KEGG pathways based on the FE calculated
  by the PathfindR [18] bioinformatic tool for the different sample group comparisons
  (Table 2). Enriched pathways (rows) and sample comparisons (columns) were hierarchically
  clustered. For limited space reasons, disease-specific pathways are not depicted
  (e.g., “bladder cancer” or “thyroid cancer”)'
