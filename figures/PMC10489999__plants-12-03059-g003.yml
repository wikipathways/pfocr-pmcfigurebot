caption: Allantoin-elicited phytohormone-mediated abiotic stress response in plants.
  Allantoin increases the level of abscisic acid (ABA) in plant cells either by the
  activation of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) or throughÎ²-glycosidase homolog
  (BG1) hydrolytic conversion of inactive bound ABA into free form of ABA. Free ABA
  activates the jasmonic acid (JA) signalling pathway via the regulation of MYC2 transcription
  factor. Jasmonic acid functions to promote the biosynthesis of anthocyanin, root
  growth inhibition, and tolerance to oxidative stress
