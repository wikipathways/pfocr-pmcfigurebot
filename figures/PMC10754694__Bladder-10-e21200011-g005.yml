caption: Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals the transcriptome of cells in
  the tumor microenvironment of bladder cancer samples. (A) The differentially expressed
  genes among each cluster. (B–C) tSNE visualization of reference cell types and 11
  GEO data sets. (D) tSNE plot exhibiting the expression of macrophage-related markers
  on myeloid linage cells. (E) The composition of myeloid linage cells shown on tSNE
  graph. (F–G) GSEA and GO analysis elucidating EMP1 relevant pathways
article_title: Single-cell analyses EMP1 as a marker of the ratio of M1/M2 macrophages
  is associated with EMT, immune infiltration, and prognosis in bladder cancer
