caption: 'HFD and age attenuated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the hippocampus.
  Proteins were determined using Western blotting. Immunoblots at (A) 3 months, (B)
  6 months and (C) 10 months of age, (D–G) quantification of protein levels: (D) Insulin
  receptor β, (E) PI3K p85, (F) Akt, (G) p-Akt (Ser473). Percentage of the stained
  area is expressed as a % of 3-month-old WT on HFD to enable the comparison of multiple
  staining series. The data are presented as the means ± SD. Statistical analysis
  was made via one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test (n = 5–8 mice per group).
  The significance of changes induced by diet: *: p < 0.05, ****: p < 0.0001, by age:
  X: p < 0.05, XX: p < 0.01, XXX: p < 0.001, XXXX: p < 0.0001, by genotype: ##: p
  < 0.01, ####: p < 0.0001'
