figure_title: KEGG annotations and enrichment of differentially expressed upregulated
  metabolites where (a) SZQ and AJH, (b) XQC and SZQ, and (c) XQC and SZQ.
caption: 'KEGG annotations and enrichment of differentially expressed upregulated
  metabolites where (a) SZQ and AJH, (b) XQC and SZQ, and (c) XQC and SZQ. Abscissa
  represents the quantification of metabolites, while ordinate shows the KEGG metabolic
  pathway found in the specific division as per order. Note: The rich factor is the
  ratio of the differentially expressed metabolites in the corresponding pathway to
  the total number of metabolites detected by the pathway. The higher the value, the
  greater the degree of enrichment. The closer the p-value is to 0, the more significant
  the enrichment. The size of the mid-point represents the number of metabolites enriched
  into the corresponding pathway with significant differences'
