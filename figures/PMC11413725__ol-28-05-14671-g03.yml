figure_title: TREM2 promotes the proliferation of renal cell carcinoma cells by inhibiting
  the P53 signaling pathway.
caption: TREM2 promotes the proliferation of renal cell carcinoma cells by inhibiting
  the P53 signaling pathway. (A) Western blotting was used to assess the effects of
  the knockdown or overexpression of TREM2 on the protein and phosphorylation levels
  of P53 and P21, as well as the phosphorylation levels. (B) Semi-quantitative results
  of P53, p-P53, P21 and p-P21 protein bands. Relative ratio of (C) p-P53/P53 and
  (D) p-P21/P21. **P<0.01. TREM2, triggering receptor that is expressed on myeloid
  cells-2; sh, short hairpin; NC, negative control
