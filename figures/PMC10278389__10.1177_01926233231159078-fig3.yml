caption: Heatmap of hepatic gene expression of selected genes included in PPARα-mediated
  lipid transport and metabolism (KEGG PPAR Signaling Pathway) or cytotoxicity gene
  sets., Significant (FDR < 0.1) differentially expressed genes (rows) are indicated
  by warmer (i.e., red, upregulated genes) or cooler (i.e., blue, downregulated genes)
  colors. Intensity of colors is based on the log (fold change) value of each gene
  for each study, sex, and dose group. White cells indicate that gene was not significantly
  altered by HFPO-DA exposure compared with respective controls. Transcriptomic data
  included in this heatmap are from the DuPont OECD 408 and 421 studies. The HFPO-DA
  dose levels are indicated by right triangles at the top of the heatmap for each
  study, increasing from 0.1 to 5 mg/kg for each study and sex. Methods for transcriptomic
  analyses are described in Chappell et al and Heintz et al. FDR, false discovery
  rate; HFPO-DA, ammonium 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoate; OECD,
  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor alpha.
