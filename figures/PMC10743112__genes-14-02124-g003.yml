caption: 'Pfcarl, Pfact, and Pfugt are not directly targeted by imidazolopiperazine
  (IPZ) GNF179 but associated with membrane transport. Drug GNF179 (100 nM) and the
  mutations impact on the genes Pfcarl, Pfact, Pfugt conferring resistant to IPZ in
  the following mutants: (a) D6_Pfcarl; (b) B3_Pfact and (c) B6_Pfugt parasites. (d)
  Common biological process, molecular function between lipase putative and Pfcarl,
  Pfact genes. (e) Common biological process, molecular function between acyl CoA
  synthetase (Pfacs6) Pfact and Pfugt genes. (e) Common biological process, molecular
  function between acyl CoA synthetase (Pfacs6), acyl-CoA-binding protein 1 (PfACBP1)
  and Pfact, Pfugt genes. (f) common cellular component between Pfacs6 and pfacbp1,
  pfcarl, and pfact. (g) acyl CoA synthetase (Pfacs6), acyl-CoA-binding protein 1
  (PfACBP1), Pfcarl, Pfact, and Pfugt association with membrane transport and involvement
  in ER-controlled metabolic pathway (Malaria Parasite Metabolic Pathways: MPMP)'
