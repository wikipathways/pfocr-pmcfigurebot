caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways of aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates (GSLs) and
  the heatmap of related BjuGSLs responding to beet armyworm larvae chewing in mustard.
  The biosynthetic pathway of aliphatic (A), indolic (B), aromatic (C) GSLs, and sulfur
  assimilation (D) and the heatmap of related BjuGSLs. The scale bar represents FPKM
  values. The number in parentheses represents the copy number of the key genes related
  to GSL biosynthesis; the first one means the corresponding DEGs; the second one
  means total copy of the gene. Abbreviations: BCAT, branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase;
  BAT5, probable sodium/metabolite cotransporter BASS5; MAM, methylthioalkylmalate
  synthase; IPMI-SSU, isopropylmalate isomerase small subunit; IIL1, isopropylmalate
  isomerase large subunit 1; IMDH1, isopropylmalate dehydrogenase 1; CYP79A, phenylalanine
  N-monooxygenase; CYP79B, tryptophan N-monooxygenase; CYP79C/F, cytochrome P450 79C/F;
  CYP83B, CYP83B monooxygenase; GSTF/U, glutathione S-transferase F/U; GGP1, γ-glutamyl
  peptidase 1; SUR1, C-S lyase 1; SOT, sulfotransferase; FMOGS-OX, flavin-containing
  monooxygenase; AOP2, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase; SCPL17, serine carboxypeptidase-like
  17; IGMT, indole GSL O-methyltransferase; APK, adenylyl-sulfate kinase; APR, 5′-adenylylsulfate
  reductase; APS, ATP sulfurylase; GSH2, glutathione synthetase. The framework of
  the aliphatic, indolic biosynthetic pathways and sulfur assimilation is adapted
  from ref. [34]'
