caption: 'MiRNA-assisted targeted therapy. The mechanisms of targeted therapy resistance
  in tumors: (A) Alterations in EGFR signaling pathways; (B) Activation of aberrant
  bypass pathways—HER2 amplification and aberrant IGF-1R activation; (C) Downstream
  pathway activation—RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR; (D) Histological/phenotypic
  transformation—SCLC and EMT. MiRNAs can cause or reverse targeted therapy resistance
  through the mechanisms described above'
