caption: Membrane lipid content and total fatty acid composition of WT and OsMGD1
  transgenic rice seedlings under salt stress. (a) OsMGD1 mediates the biosynthetic
  pathway of the galactolipid MGDG and DGDG in rice. OsMGD1 uses DAG as a substrate
  to synthesize MGDG, and MGDG is a precursor of DGDG. MGDG and DGDG are the hallmark
  lipids of photosynthetic membranes, accounting for approximately 80% of total membrane
  lipids. (b,c) Relative amounts of lipids and (d,e) fatty acid composition of total
  lipids in leaves of rice seedlings under normal (control, left) and salt stress
  (NaCl, right) condition. MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; DGDG, digalactosyldiacylglycerol;
  SQDG, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PI, phosphatidylinositol;
  PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine. WT, wild type; OE, OsMGD1-overexpressing
  lines; Ri, OsMGD1-RNA interfering lines. Data are means Â± SD (n = 5 biological replicates).
  Different letters indicate significance at p < 0.05 as determined by LSD test
