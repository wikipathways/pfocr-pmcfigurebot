figure_title: KEGG enrichment bubble map of DEGs.
caption: KEGG enrichment bubble map of DEGs. (A) KEGG analysis of DEGs in the roots.
  (B) KEGG analysis of DEGs in nodules. The vertical coordinates indicate the different
  metabolic pathways and the horizontal coordinates indicate the p-values corresponding
  to the metabolic pathways. The size of the enrichment factor is indicated by the
  color of the dot, where the larger the value is, the closer the color will be to
  red. The number of differential genes contained under each pathway is indicated
  by the size of the scatter
