figure_title: Auxin-induced PC interdigitation is decoupled from cell expansion-induced
  mechanical stress
caption: (A) PC interdigitation does not correlate with mechanical stress or cell
  size in early-developing cotyledons. Shown are correlation plots between margin
  roughness (MR) and the largest empty circle (LEC, upper graph), which is indicative
  of the mechanical stress 747 and between MR and cell size/area (lower panel) at
  0 HAP, 24 HAP and 48 HAP and at different positions (tip, base, middle) in the cotyledon.
  Green line is the linear model. Gray shadows display the 95% confidence interval.
  R2 = correlation coefficient. (B) Cell expansion without PC interdigitation. 24
  HAP wild-type seedlings were either mock-treated or treated with 1 μM auxin NAA
  or 1 μM brassinolide for 4 days. Then, cotyledons were stained and imaged by confocal
  microscopy for posterior analysis with PaCeQuant. Growth for 1 day before treatment
  is crucial to avoid auxin-induced inhibition of germination. (C) Violin plot of
  cell size (left) and margin roughness (right) computed from images as shown in B.
  n > 51–109 cells from 9 cotyledons. Box plot inside each violin plot depicts four
  quartiles and the median. Red dot depicts the mean value. Wilcox test, *p<0.05,
  ****p<0.0001. (D) Auxin-induced de novo lobe formation without increasing cell size
  in single cell tracking experiments. Cotyledons (3 DAP) with formed lobes (blue
  arrowheads) were mock-treated (diluted DMSO) or treated with 20 nM auxin NAA for
  2.5 days and analyzed as described in Figure 3C. (E) Percentage variation (Δ) in
  cell size (top) and margin roughness (bottom) calculated with pre/post treatment
  pairwise images. n = 15 cells, from 5 cotyledons each from different seedlings.
  Same results were obtained in 3 independent experiments. t-test, ** p<0.01, ns =
  non-significance. (F) A model for a hierarchical global and local auxin signaling
  systems underlying the PC interdigitation pattern. A basal level of auxin, which
  self-amplifies via TIR1/AFB1-dependent auxin signaling to activate IBR-dependent
  auxin synthesis genes (purple dots). This is counteracted by cytokinin signaling,
  restricting auxin maxima (increased red color) to the tip of cotyledons. The auxin
  maxima act as a global signal by emanating to the remaining regions of the cotyledon
  epidermis (wavy black arrow) presumably via diffusion through the apoplastic space,
  which locally increases the level of auxin for a specific cell. The resultant local
  auxin (red dots) then triggers TMK/ROP-dependent cell polarization and cell-cell
  coordination by activating the feedback loop and the complementary ROP2/ROP6 pathways
  to coordinate lobe and indentation formation 10,16,20,21
