figure_title: Neuroinflammatory pathway following estrogen deficiency.
caption: Neuroinflammatory pathway following estrogen deficiency. (1) Estrogen can
  inhibit the secretion of inflammatory factors by T cells and macrophages, and the
  decrease in estrogen levels leads to chronic inflammation during perimenopause,
  resulting in an increase in inflammatory mediators in peripheral blood. (2) These
  peripheral cytokines will directly or indirectly reach the brain via different specific
  or non-specific pathways. (3) In premenopause, β-estradiol inhibits microglia-mediated
  astrocytic activation to alleviate neuroinflammation and the secretion of inflammatory
  mediators by microglia. On the other hand, in perimenopause, estrogen deficiency
  allows inflammatory cytokines to activate microglia in the brain, which then produce
  other inflammatory mediators. (4) IL-β, IL-6, and TNF-α reduce the synthesis of
  5-HT by stimulating indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). (5) IDO can convert tryptophan
  into kynurenine, and the activation of the kynurenine pathway results in the production
  of ROS and RNS. On the other hand, superoxide anion radicals can cause superinduction
  of the kynurenine pathway. (6) ROS and RNS reduce the synthesis of 5-HT by stimulating
  IDO and the kynurenine pathway. (7) Neuroglia secrete serotonin, which then promotes
  BDNF secretion. (8) Similarly, estrogen can promote the synthesis and secretion
  of BDNF; therefore, after menopause, insufficient estrogen can lead to a decrease
  in BDNF synthesis. (9) IL-β, IL-6, and TNF-α can inhibit the neuroprotective effect
  of BDNF. (10) IL-β, IL-6, TNF-α can promote the production of ROS in mitochondria.
  Furthermore, the ROS can also promote the synthesis and release of inflammatory
  factors. (11) Estrogen can reduce ROS production by promoting the synthesis of antioxidant
  enzymes, and insufficient estrogen during perimenopause leads to an increase in
  ROS. (12) ROS can lead to lipid, DNA, and protein oxidation and damage in the brain.
  (13) ROS reduces the production of monoaminergic neurotransmitters and other aminergic
  compounds. (14) IL-β decreases the rate-limiting enzyme in noradrenaline. (15) IL-β,
  IL-6, and TNF-α can suppress GABAergic inhibitory transmission
