figure_title: A lysosomal signalling pathway of AMPK activation by metformin.
caption: 'A lysosomal signalling pathway of AMPK activation by metformin. An intricate
  hub of signalling proteins resides on the lysosome membrane; among them, the Ragulator
  complex, v-ATPase, γ-secretase, and AMPK can interact with each other, regulating
  lysosome response to stimuli (A). Metformin binds to PEN2, a subunit of γ-secretase.
  The metformin-PEN2 complex joins with a cytoplasmic subunit (ATP6AP1) of v-ATPase
  and inhibits the proton pump. In this condition, axin associates with Ragulator
  and v-ATPase and recruits LKB1, which activates AMPK by phosphorylation (B). L1-5:
  Lamtor1-5; MET: metformin'
