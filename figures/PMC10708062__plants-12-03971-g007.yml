figure_title: Analysis of DEGs involved in photosynthesis pathway in leaves.
caption: Analysis of DEGs involved in photosynthesis pathway in leaves. (a,b) Major
  pathway of photosynthesis and key antenna protein. (c) The expression patterns of
  DEGs involved in photosynthesis pathway. The green rectangles in pathway represent
  down-regulated DEGs, while the blue rectangles in pathway represent insignificant
  changes genes. The color spectrum of heat map represents log2FC values from high
  to low, |Log2FC| â‰¥ 1. Schemes were retrieved from KEGG (ko00195, ko00196). Shapes
  and arrows follow the KEGG representation standards (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/,
