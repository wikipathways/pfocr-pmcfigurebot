figure_title: Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, normal and with Gorlin syndrome.
caption: Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, normal and with Gorlin syndrome. Off-state
  panel (a) shows the absence of the Hh ligand. On-state panel (b) shows the presence
  of the Hh ligand. Gorlin syndrome (c) shows the condition in pathogenic signaling.
  Mutations in Ptch1 cause an inability to suppress SMO, resulting in constant SMO
  activation and Hh pathway hyperactivation with the absence or presence of the Hh
  ligand. The figure was created using BioRender.com (accessed on 1 August 2023)
