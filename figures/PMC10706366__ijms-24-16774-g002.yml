figure_title: Biosynthetic pathway of strigolactone (SL).
caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of strigolactone (SL). This figure depicts the SL biosynthetic
  route and important enzymes involved in biosynthesis. SL biosynthesis occurs in
  two distinct compartments: plastid and cytosol. All-trans-β-carotene is converted
  to carlactone (CL) in plastids via three intermediary stages catalyzed by D27 (At27),
  CCD7 (MAX3, D17, RMS5, DAD3) and CCD8 (MAX4, D10, RMS1, DAD1), respectively. Carlactone
  then enters the cytosol, where it is metabolized to several other SLs via cytochrome
  P450 monooxygenase (MAX1, OsMAX1, PhMAX1) and numerous other unidentified enzymes'
