figure_title: GO and KEGG enrichment analysis plots.
caption: GO and KEGG enrichment analysis plots. (A) Bubble plot of GO enrichment analysis
  of differentially expressed genes in S.vs.C; (B) bubble plot of GO enrichment analysis
  of differentially expressed genes in C.vs.Z1; (C) bubble plot of GO enrichment analysis
  of differentially expressed genes in C.vs.Z2; (D) KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed genes in S.vs.C; (E) KEGG enrichment of differentially expressed genes
  in C.vs.Z1 analysis; (F) KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes
  in C.vs.Z2. The top 20 GO term entries and the top 20 KEGG pathways with the smallest
  FDR value, i.e., the most significant enrichment, were selected for display, and
  the closer to zero the FER or FDR, the more significant the enrichment
