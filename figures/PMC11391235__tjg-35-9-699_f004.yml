  FUT6 suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of ESCA cells via the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway. (A) Western blotting of the protein expression levels of p-EGFR, EGFR, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 in TE-1 cells transfected with oe-FUT6 in the presence of EGF (50 ng/mL) or 1% BSA, ***P < .001 vs. oe-NC group. (B) CCK-8 assay measurement of the proliferation of TE-1 cells transfected with oe-FUT6 in the presence of EGF (50 ng/mL) or 1% BSA. (C) Transwell assay measurement of the migration of TE-1 cells transfected with oe-FUT6 in the presence of EGF (50 ng/mL) or 1% BSA. (D) Transwell assay measurement of the invasion of TE-1 cells transfected with oe-FUT6 in the presence of EGF (50 ng/mL) or 1% BSA. (E) Western blotting of the protein expression levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin in TE-1 cells transfected with oe-FUT6 in the presence of EGF (50 ng/mL) or 1% BSA. Data: mean ± SEM. N = 3. **P < .01, ***P < .001 vs. 1% BSA + oe-NC group. ###
