caption: Genes encoding the enzymes for the Entner-Doudoroff (E-D) metabolic pathway
  are up-regulated during growth in urine and media with urea. Structures of the chemical
  intermediates of the E-D pathway are shown with names below the structure. The function
  of each enzyme is indicated above the arrow in green. The increased expression of
  each gene is indicated in parenthesis under the enzyme name in green as determined
  from Cole et al (8). Zwf oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate by reducing NADP+ to NADPH
  and H+ (indicated in red text)
