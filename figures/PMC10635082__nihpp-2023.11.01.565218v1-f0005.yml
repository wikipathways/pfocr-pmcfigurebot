figure_title: Pyrvinium targets multiple vulnerabilities of MCC
caption: (A) Protein levels of WNT5A/B under pyrvinium treatment for 24 hrs in WaGa
  and MKL-2 cells. (B) Relative mRNA levels of AXIN2, ATOH1 and SOX2 genes in WaGa
  cells after treatment with human recombinant WNT5B protein for 6 hrs, measured by
  RT-qPCR. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired two sample T-test.
  (C) Protein levels of total β-catenin, WNT5B, ATOH1, SOX2 and GFP after treatment
  with human recombinant WNT5B for 6 hrs in WaGa TopGFP stable cells. (D) Protein
  levels of p53, intrinsic apoptosis pathway indicator cleaved-PARP and pro-apoptotic
  protein PUMA were measured by WB in p53 wild type cell lines (WaGa, MKL-1) and p53
  mutant/null cell lines (MS-1, MKL-2) 24 hours post 0.5 μM of pyrvinium treatment
  and (E) 1 μM of Nutlin-3a treatment respectively. (F) Representative data shown
  as a line chart to demonstrate the basal respiration level and maximal respiration
  capacity (after FCCP injection) at each measurement time point (means ± SEM; n=6).
  (G) Seahorse OCR analysis was performed to measure uncoupled OCR in WaGa cells treated
  with different doses of pyrvinium for 24 h, compared with cells treated with DMSO.
  Statistical significance was determined Kruskal Wallis H Test followed by Dunnett’s
  post hoc test. (H) Quantification of WB results of all batches of OXPHOS WB result
  (n = 4). The mean relative protein expression of GAPDH in vehicle control samples
  was taken as 100%, with all other values expressed relative to this 100% (means
  ± SEM). Statistical significance was determined by ordinary ANOVA test followed
  by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. (I) The level of proteins that reflect ER
  stress was detected by WB in MCC cell lines (WaGa, MKL-1, MS-1, and MKL-2) under
  treatment by pyrvinium for 6 hours and 24 hours. (J) The level of proteins that
  reflect UPR response was detected by WB in WaGa cells after treatment with pyrvinium
  or other ER stress inducers for 24 hours. (****, p < 0.0001; ***, p < 0.001; **,
