caption: PGC migration strategies and signaling logic. Migrating PGCs interpret chemical
  guidance cues using different classes of receptors and lipid phosphate phosphatases.
  Rho-GTPases commonly establish cell polarity, but their upstream linkage to guidance
  receptors is largely unclear. Different receptor–cue pairs that affect PGC guidance
  (classified by a role in early or late migration if known, following the convention
  described in ) are shown on the right of each species-specific PGC schematic. Lipid
  phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) dephosphorylate unidentified phospholipids to establish
  permissive migration zones. (A) Signaling pathways at the front and rear of zebrafish
  PGCs. In a typical front bleb cycle, Rac1 signaling first activates Arp2/3 to create
  an F-actin template. RhoA and calcium-MLCK signaling then drive actomyosin contractility
  to form a pressurized bleb, a region of plasma membrane detached from the actin
  cortex. Retrograde F-actin flow occurs from front to back, moving F-actin-linked
  proteins, such as Ezrin and septins, to the back to inhibit bleb formation and enhance
  front–back polarity. (B) Signaling pathways at the front and rear of Drosophila
  PGCs. Net actin polymerization at the cell front is required to maintain front-to-rear
  cortical actin flows, but the molecular details are unclear. A proposed front F-actin
  polymerization pathway includes the generation of PIP2 leading to Arp2/3-driven
  branched actin polymerization. However, inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex only mildly
  perturbs cortical flow, suggesting that a formin is involved. At the rear of PGCs,
  AMPK phosphorylates RhoGEF2, mediating its release from inhibitory microtubule interactions.
  This allows RhoGEF2 to activate RhoA and generate actomyosin contractility to direct
  cortical flow. (C) Signaling pathways at the front and rear of Xenopus PGCs. In
  culture, motile Xenopus PGCs are elongated with a leading bleb. Similar to Drosophila
  PGCs, RhoA signaling appears to be more crucial than Rac1 and is likely active at
  the rear. PIP3 has been shown to be enriched in blebs in a Kif13b-dependent manner
  and likely regulates actomyosin contractility to generate blebs. Retrograde F-actin
  flow likely occurs, but it is unclear whether it is local or global. (D) Signaling
  pathways at the front and rear of mouse PGCs. The importance of PI3K and Src are
  inferred from in vitro studies with inhibitors, whereas the importance of Rac1 has
  been shown in vivo. No functional data exists for signaling or cytoskeletal function
  at the rear of mouse PGCs. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; Cxcl12, C-X-C motif
