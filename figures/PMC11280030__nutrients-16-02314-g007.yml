  and C.
caption: The MAPK signaling pathway was the potential target of phenylalanine and
  C. minuta. (A) Sample correlation test. (B) Principal component analysis (PCA) of
  individual samples for the normalized mRNA data in liver tissue. (C) Plot of differentially
  expressed genes. (D) Hub genes analyzed by Cytoscape and Mode among DEGs compared
  with groups B and T. (E) KEGG analysis of DEGs compared with groups B and T. (F)
  The common DEGs in pairwise comparisons. (G) Trend graph of all genes under profile
  14, where the thick green curves indicate the expression trend across all genes
  in a module. (H) GO analysis of profile 14. (I) KEGG analysis of profile 14. Group
  B represents Phe group; Group T represents Phe + C. minuta group
