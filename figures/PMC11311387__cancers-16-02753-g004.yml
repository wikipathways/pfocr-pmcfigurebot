caption: Involvement of p53 in cell stress responses and glycosylation-related pathways
  and the relationship between p53 glycosylation and cancer progression. (a) Upon
  cellular stress, p53 is upregulated and translocated into the nucleus to transcriptionally
  regulate genes that are implicated in stress response pathways including the DNA
  damage response and energy metabolism homeostasis. (b) During the response to DNA
  damage, wild-type p53 is phosphorylated and activated, which leads to cell cycle
  arrest and apoptosis via transcription of p21 and NOXA. p53 also transcriptionally
  regulates expression of alpha-L-Fucosidase 1 (FUCA1) and TP53-induced glycolysis
  and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) protein to modulate fucosylation and glycolysis
  pathways. Hyperactivation of these two pathways is associated with cell proliferation
  and tumor survival. p53 inhibits pro-proliferative NF-κB activation by favoring
  phosphorylation (Ser733) of Inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK), which
  competes with O-GlcNAcylation (Ser733) of IKK. O-GlcNAcylation of p53 (Ser149) competes
  with phosphorylation (Thr155), which attenuates ubiquitination-mediated p53 degradation
  as well as p53 nuclear export mediated by Jun activation domain-binding protein
  1 (JAB1). Oncogenic mutant of p53 (mt p53) also promotes cancer by inducing N-glycan
  folding of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via the transcriptional regulation of
  ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 5 (ENTPD5) protein
