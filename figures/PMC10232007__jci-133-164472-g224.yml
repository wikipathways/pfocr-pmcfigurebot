figure_title: miR-21 silencing induces an antiinflammatory phenotype and upregulates
  TGF-β–related pathway in macrophages
caption: Macrophages transfected with an miR-21 antagomir (antagomir-21) or scramble
  control followed by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry. (A) miR-21-5p fold change in BMDMs
  after 48-hour transfection with antagomir-21 (n = 8). (B) Spry2 mRNA fold change
  in BMDMs after 48-hour transfection with antagomir-21 (n = 8). (C) Tgfb1 fold change
  in BMDMs after transfection with antagomir-21, n = 8 per group pooled from 2 independent
  experiments. (D) Spearman’s correlation between miR-21-5p expression and Tgfb1 mRNA
  expression (n = 11). (E) RT-qPCR of Tgfbr2, Tgfbr1, Tgfbr3, and Smad7 in BMDMs after
  48-hour transfection with antagomir-21 (n = 8). (F) RT-qPCR of proinflammatory genes
  Tnfa and Il6 in BMDMs transfected with antagomir-21 (n = 8). (G) RT-qPCR of antiinflammatory
  genes Mrc1 and Il10, n = 8 per group, pooled from 2 independent experiments. (H)
  Flow cytometry analysis of TGF-βR2 expression in BMDMs after silencing miR-21-5p,
  n = 4 per group. The bar graphs represent the percentage of F4/80+TGF-βR2+ cells.
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 by unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s
  t test (A–C and E–G)
