caption: 'The relative concentrations of the metabolites. Notes: The relative concentrations
  of the metabolites involved in the glycolytic pathway and triacylglycerol pathway
  (part) in MDA-MB-231 cells (red) and MCF-7 cells (blue) after treatment with compound
  1 in duration of 48 h. Data are expressed as the mean value ± SD of three independent
  experiments. Columns, mean of cells; bars, SD; * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; SD, standard
  deviation; purple text indicates metabolites concentrations changed after treatment
  in both cell lines; ER, endoplasmatic reticulum; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP,
  adenosine triphosphate; GLC-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; glycerol-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; Ac-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme
