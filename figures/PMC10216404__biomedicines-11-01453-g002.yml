figure_title: The effects of RSV on activation of SIRT1 signalling pathway.
caption: 'The effects of RSV on activation of SIRT1 signalling pathway. The activation
  of the SIRT1-FoxO3a complex transcription in MSCs promote osteoblast differentiation
  while suppressing PPARγ and Sox9 to inhibit adipocyte and chondrocyte differentiation,
  respectively. Meanwhile, the transcriptional activity of SIRT1-FoxO increases SOD2
  production to reduce ROS production and inhibits the NF-κB and signalling pathway,
  which favour osteoclastogenesis. Abbreviation: SIRT1: silent information regulator
  of transcription 1; FoxO: Forkhead box O; RunX2: runt-related transcription factor;
  PGC1α: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator; ROS: Reactive
  Oxygen Species; SOD: Superoxide dismutase; NFATc1: nuclear factor-activated T cells;
  PPARγ: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ; NF-κB: Nuclear factor-κB;
  ALP: Alkaline phosphatase; Col1: Collagen type 1; OCN; Osteocalcin'
