  pathway.
caption: 'AO inhibits the expression of SREBP1 by inactivating the AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway. (A) Protein expression levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR and p-AMPKα in SK-Hep1 and
  HepG2 cells were detected by western blotting after treatment with AO (100 μM) for
  different durations (0, 6, 12 and 24 h). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. 0 h.
  (B) Protein expression levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR and p-AMPKα were semi-quantified.
  *P<0.05, ***P<0.001, #P<0.0001 vs. 0 h. (C) SK-Hep1 and (D) HepG2 cells were treated
  with different concentrations of AO combined with MK2206 (1 μM) for 48 h, and cell
  viability was measured using the cell counting Kit-8 assay. (E) Protein expression
  levels of p-AKT were detected by western blotting in SK-Hep1 and HepG2 cells treated
  with AO (50 μM), MK2206 (1 μM) or the combination for 24 h. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001.
