caption: 11β-HSD1 promotes osteoclastogenesis through Hippo signaling pathway. A.
  Transcriptome analysis of the BMMs isolated from the control and KI femurs. B. Representative
  IF images of TRAP (red), YAP (green) and DAPI (blue). C. Quantitative analysis of
  the area of TRAP colocalized with YAP (yellow) near femoral growth plate. D. Representative
  immumohistochemical images showing YAP in the femors from control, KO and KI groups.
  E. Quantification analysis of YAP staining. F. WB evaluation of 11β-HSD1 and YAP
  expression change in BMMs under verteporfin conditions. G. Verteporfin was added
  into osteoclast incubation medium. TRAP staining was performed to evaluate the osteoclast
  formation (Left) and the quantitative analysis (Right)
