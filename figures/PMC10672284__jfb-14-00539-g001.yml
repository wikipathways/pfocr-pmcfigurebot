caption: 'Multifaceted functions of (AMPs): (A) Depiction of the signaling pathway
  involved in Gram-negative bacteria-induced infection caused by lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS). (B) AMPs bind directly to LPS, leading to the inhibition of LPs-mediated
  inflammation. (C) Cationic AMPs bind to the negatively charged phosphatidyl serine
  (PS) heads on cancer cell membranes'
