figure_title: Contrasting roles of AGRP and POMC neurons in glucose and lipid homeostasis.
caption: 'Contrasting roles of AGRP and POMC neurons in glucose and lipid homeostasis.
  AGRP neurons are depolarized by orexigenic hormones such as ghrelin and hyperpolarized
  by insulin and leptin. AGRP neurons have integral roles in increasing hepatic glucose
  production, while its inactivation results in a suppression of endogenous glucose
  production from the liver. Activation of IR and LepR hyperpolarize AGRP neurons,
  while GHSR activation depolarizes AGRP neurons. Insulin receptor activation in AGRP
  neurons results in hyperpolarization via K-ATP channels and a decrease in AGRP neuronal
  activity. This inturn alters hepatic vagal efferents to reduce endogenous glucose
  production. This mechanism involves regulation of IL6 release from the liver. Briefly,
  a decrease in AGRP neuronal activity results in an increase in IL6 release from
  Kupffer cells. Apart from having inflammatory roles, IL6 also mediates hypoglycemic
  effects. IL6 acts in a paracrine manner on hepatocytes to suppress hepatic gluconeogenic
  gene expression, resulting in a reduction in endogenous glucose production. Apart
  from regulating parasympathetic efferent outflow to the liver, AGRP activation also
  results in reduced sympathetic outflow to adipose depots. This results in metabolic
  impairments characterized by a shift in substrate utilization for energy production.
  Mainly, a lesser reliance on lipid as a predominant energy source, and reduced thermogenesis
  in BAT. ROCK1 is an important mediator of leptin’s effects in AGRP neurons. Loss
  of ROCK1 in AGRP has been shown to attenuate leptin’s effect and result in leptin
  resistance. In contrast to AGRP neurons, IR and LepR have been predominantly shown
  to depolarize POMC neurons. However, due to POMC neuronal heterogeneity, activation
  of POMC-specific insulin signaling pathway has been shown to both reduce and increase
  hepatic glucose production. Incretins such as GLP1 have been shown to act on ARC
  neurons, predominantly via the GLP1R in POMC neurons. GLP1R activation stimulates
  POMC neurons resulting in an improved metabolic phenotype. POMC activation results
  in augmented sympathetic activity to adipose depots, leading to increased thermogenesis
  and reduced adiposity. Thereby POMC neuronal activation can improve metabolic parameters
  via the brain–adipose tissue axis. AGRP: Agouti-related protein; POMC: Pro-opiomelanocortin;
