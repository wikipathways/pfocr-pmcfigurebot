figure_title: Cell proliferation activity affects viral titer.
caption: Cell proliferation activity affects viral titer. (A) The proportion of Ki67-positive
  cells detected by flow cytometry. (B) Differences in the proportion of Ki67-positive
  cells in statistics. (C) CCK-8 method for detecting cell proliferation ability.
  (D) RNA-Seq and signaling pathway enrichment analysis. Molecular signature classification
  screening by GSEA analysis with top enriched with representative ECM receptor interaction
  signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, and cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways.
  (E) Differential expression gene heatmap in the ECM receptor interaction signaling,
  JAK-STAT signaling, and cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways. Data are
  means ± SD. Two-tailed Student’s t-test determined statistical significance. p <
