caption: 'WDR82 knockdown decreases in vitro cell viability and proliferation and
  extends survival of pHGG-tumor-bearing mice: (A). Normalized cell viability of SJ-GBM2
  and SF8628 cells transduced with inducible shRNA #1 or #2 against WDR82 or non-target
  shRNA (shNT) in the absence or presence of Dox (2 µg/mL), in comparison to parental
  non-treated cells. (B,C). Representative images (B) and quantitative results (C)
  showed colony formation in 500 KNS42 cells transduced with shRNAs #1 or #2, or shNT
  in the absence or presence of Dox (2 µg/mL). (D). Correlations between WDR82 and
  CDK2 in pediatric gliomas. (E). ChIPseq results for H3K4me3 levels at CDK2 and CCND1
  promoters in the absence and presence of Dox in SJ-GBM2 cells. (F). The illustration
  indicates that WDR82-mediated H3K4me3 at CCND1 promoter regulates cell proliferation,
  cell cycle, and DNA damage through activating the cyclin D1-CDK2 signaling pathway.
