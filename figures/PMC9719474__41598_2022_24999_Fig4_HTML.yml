caption: Differential pathway activation/inhibition in HG compared to NG conditions.
  (A) Key pathways highlighted from pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs (± 1.2
  fold change, adjusted p-value < 0.05 for significance) determined at each of the
  pairwise comparisons of each time point, 0 h vs 0.5 h NG/HG, 0 h vs 1 h NG/HG, 0 h
  vs 4 h NG/HG, 0 h vs 8 h NG/HG, and 0 h vs 24 h NG/HG using IPA. Dots show non-significant
  enrichment. (B) The 0 vs 4 h pairwise comparison, where most significant pathways
  are activated/inhibited. A right-tailed Fisher’s Exact test was used to measure
  significance of the pathway enrichment in the gene set. The horizontal bars show
  the level of significance (−log10 p-value). The colour coding of bars indicates
  activation/inhibition determined by the z-score (generated using fold change and
  curated pathway relationships from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base), > or < 2 respectively.
  Hashed bars show significant z-scores. Signalling pathways of interest are highlighted
  by colour coded boxes.
