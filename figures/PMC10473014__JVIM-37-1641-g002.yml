caption: 'The symbiotic relationship between the host respiratory mucosal tissues
  and microbial communities in health and disease. (1) Homeostasis is achieved with
  a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship between the host respiratory mucosal
  surface and commensal microbial communities in health. Although low in biomass,
  the microbiota is rich and diverse. Pathobionts, potentially pathogenic organisms
  which in states of health live as nonharmful symbionts, may be included in the microbial
  population. The mucosal surface is free of inflammation, with effective physical
  and chemical barriers and functional mucosal immunity. Commensal bacteria are represented
  by (A), the mucociliary apparatus by (B), and ciliated epithelial cells by (C).
  (2) An internal or external insult leads to mucosal injury. (3) With damage to the
  epithelial cells, mucociliary function is negatively impacted, and microbial communities
  are altered (generally resulting in decreased diversity). Respiratory dysbiosis
  is believed to play a key role in the disruption of the homeostatic state. Low‐grade
  inflammation and decreased microbial diversity are represented in (D). Subsequent
  events determine the fate of the host‐microbe relationship with 2 possible outcomes:
  a pathway of repair and healing or a vicious cycle of inflammation. (4) With removal
  and recovery from the insult, host repair mechanisms are initiated. Loss of danger
  signals, termination of inflammation, epithelial barrier repair, increased diversity
  of commensals, and decreased pathogen colonization are represented by (E). In time
  and without additional insults, (5) healing can occur, returning the environment
  to homeostasis. If repair and healing fail to occur and the respiratory mucosal
  tissues enter a vicious cycle of inflammation (4′), there is a transition to pathogenic
  bacteria such as pathobionts or opportunists (F), with recruitment of immune cells
  (G) and perpetuated mucosal injury. (5′) This leads to clinically evident respiratory
  disease with more profound dysbiosis. (6) With knowledge of the impact of loss of
  homeostasis on respiratory mucosal tissues, the challenge to the scientific community
  is to develop therapeutic interventions that target inflammation and restore beneficial
  commensal bacterial communities.'
