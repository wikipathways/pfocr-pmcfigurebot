figure_title: ZNFX1 regulation of macrophage bactericidal activity through the autophagy
  signaling pathway
caption: (A) Western blot assay of the regulatory effects of ZNFX1 on AMPK activation.
  mpi, minutes postinfection. (B) Western blot assay of the regulatory effects of
  ZNFX1 on the levels of p62 and LC3-I/II conversion. (C) Immunofluorescence assays
  of LC3 puncta in Znfx1–/– BMDMs treated with BafA1, followed by infection with H37Rv-RFP
  (n = 3, with 10 randomly selected fields of view for statistics). (D) Double-staining
  immunofluorescence assays of LC3 in F4/80+ macrophages in the lung and spleen tissues
  of WT and Znfx1–/– mice following H37Rv infection (n = 5, with 5 randomly selected
  fields of view for statistics). “Pearson’s R value” refers to Pearson’s correlation
  coefficient. (E) CFU assays of M. tuberculosis load in WT and Znfx1–/– BMDMs treated
  with rapamycin (n = 5). A 2-way ANOVA with Holm-Šídák post hoc test (A–D) was used
  for statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SD and are representative
  of at least 3 experiments with similar observations. *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001; ****P
  < 0.0001
