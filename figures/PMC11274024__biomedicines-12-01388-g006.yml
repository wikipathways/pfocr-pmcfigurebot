caption: Regulation of different cellular events in RG7388-resistant CLL samples.
  Binding of MDM2–p53 antagonist RG7388 to the p53-binding pocket of MDM2 releases
  and activates wild-type p53. Increased p53 activity leads to upregulation of pro-apoptosis
  pathway genes. However, in RG7388-resistant samples, DNA damage response pathway
  genes are also upregulated in addition to the co-regulated genes
