caption: NST-628 inhibits the growth of RAS- and RAF-driven cancers. A, OMNI cell
  line panel was treated with a dose-response of NST-628 for between 3 and 7 days,
  and viability was measured by CellTiter-Glo. Response rates in each mutational background
  were calculated for models with a GI50 of ≤100 nmol/L. B, HCT116 (C) IPC-298, (D)
  SK-MEL-2, and (E) MeWo cell lines were treated with 4, 20, or 100 nmol/L NST-628
  for 48 hours and were stained with Annexin V and DAPI, and live, early apoptosis,
  late apoptosis, and necrotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. F, HCT116 (G),
  IPC-298 (H), SK-MEL-2, and (I) MeWo cells were treated with a dose response of NST-628,
  trametinib, avutometinib, cobimetinib, belvarafenib, or tovorafenib for 72 hours,
  and viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo.

  Brain-Penetrant Inhibitor of the RAS–MAPK Pathway with Activity across Diverse RAS-
  and RAF-Driven Cancers.
