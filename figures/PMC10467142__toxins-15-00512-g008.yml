caption: Effect of quercetin on NF-κB signaling pathways in LPS-induced BREC. (A)
  The immunofluorescence for p-p65 and p-ERK1/2 (red) were accomplished, and the nuclear
  (DAPI; blue) was utilized. Scale bar = 50 µm. (B) Western blot analysis of ERK1/2,
  p-ERK1/2, NF-κB p65, and p-NF-κB p-p65 (n = 3)
