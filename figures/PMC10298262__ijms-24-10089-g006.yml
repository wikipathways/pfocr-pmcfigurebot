figure_title: Putative pathway of MAPK signaling–yeast in S.
caption: Putative pathway of MAPK signaling–yeast in S. rugosoannulata generated via
  KEGG analysis. (A) Gene expression profiles between the A1 and A2 growth stages.
  (B) Gene expression profiles between the A2 and A3 growth stages. The boxes with
  a red border indicate upregulation; the boxes with a green border represent downregulation.
  (C) Differential expression of MAPK signaling pathway–yeast genes at different nitrogen
  levels. (D) Validation of the gene expression levels of the MAPK signaling pathway.
  All data are presented as the means ± SDs of three independent experiments. Bars
  with different letters are significantly different at p < 0.05 according to Duncan’s
  multiple range test
