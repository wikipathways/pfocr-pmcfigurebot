  OVX MSCs.
caption: miR-145a-5p contributed to the WT apoVs-mediated rescue of impaired OVX MSCs.
  (A) Real-time PCR analysis indicated that miR-145a-5p expression was decreased in
  OVX MSCs as compared with WT MSCs, which was increased when treated with WT apoVs
  in vitro. (B) Real-time PCR analysis indicated that miR-145a-5p expression was decreased
  in OVX apoVs compared to WT apoVs. (C) Real-time PCR analysis showed that pri-miR-145a-5p
  expression was downregulated in OVX MSCs compared to WT MSCs, which was unchanged
  after apoVs stimulation. (D) Real-time PCR analysis indicated that actinomycin D
  treatment failed to affect the miR-145a-5p expression in WT apoVs treated OVX MSCs.
  (E, F) Western blot assay indicated that miR-145a-5p mimics downregulated TGF-β1/Smad2/3
  signaling pathway and upregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in OVX MSCs, while
  miR-145a-5p inhibitor displayed the opposite effect in WT MSCs. (E, F) Alizarin
  red staining showed that miR-145a-5p mimics promoted the mineralized nodule formationin
  OVX MSCs, while miR-145a-5p inhibitor displayed the opposite effect in WT MSCs.
  (I, J) Western blot assay indicated that miR-145a-5p mimics promoted the expression
  of osteogenic differentiation-related protein Runx2 and ALP in OVX MSCs, while miR-145a-5p
  inhibitor displayed the opposite effect in WT MSCs. (K, L) Flow cytometric analysis
  indicated that miR-145a-5p mimics upregulated the immunoregulatory capacity of OVX
  MSCs, while miR-145a-5p inhibitor displayed the opposite effect in WT MSCs. n =
