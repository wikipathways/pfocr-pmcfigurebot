figure_title: Activation of IFN signaling by STING agonists reverses cGAS-STING pathway
  activity in Herceptin-resistant HER2+ BC.
caption: 'Activation of IFN signaling by STING agonists reverses cGAS-STING pathway
  activity in Herceptin-resistant HER2+ BC. (A-B) Parental and resistant SKBR3 cells
  were treated with cGAMP for 6 hours (A) or ADU-S100 for 24 hours (B), and harvested
  for western blot analysis. These assays were repeated three times. (C) Parental
  and resistant SKBR3 were treated with ADU-S100 for 24 hours, and harvested for qPCR
  analysis of downstream ISGs mRNA expression. (D) Parental and resistant SKBR3 cells
  were treated with ADU-S100 for 24 hours, and harvested for qPCR analysis of mRNA
  expression of genes involved in antigen presentation. (E) Flow cytometry measuring
  MHC-I protein on the cell membrane with ADU-S100 at different concentrations for
  24 hours using SKBR3 cell line. Data was shown as mean Â± SD. And p values are based
  on Student''s t test. **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. P: parental cells; R: resistant cells,
  qPCR: Quantitative real-time PCR, ISGs: IFN-stimulated genes'
