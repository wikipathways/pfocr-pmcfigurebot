figure_title: The roadmap of molecular changes and cellular phenotypes when cells
  lose MLL3/4-COMPASS
caption: To identify targetable cellular vulnerabilities that arise when MLL3/4 are
  compromised, a variety of multiomics approaches were utilized including a synthetic
  lethality screen and metabolic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling. In addition
  to the downregulation of MLL3/4 target genes, the loss of MLL3/4 also leads to the
  activation of MLL1/COMPASS, which drives the upregulated expression of de novo purine
  metabolism genes. This upregulation was found to be reversible by the specific inhibition
  of interaction between MLL1 and the cofactor WDR5. These findings led to the therapeutic
  evaluation of the de novo purine nucleotide synthesis pathway targeting in MLL4
  mutant colorectal cancer using lometrexol, a specific inhibitor of the purine synthesis
  enzyme GART. This promising approach may offer new hope for patients with MLL4 mutant
  colorectal cancer
