caption: 'Alterations in major signaling pathways that have been identified in OS
  development and metastasis: PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK/STAT, Wnt/β-catenin, NOTCH, Hedgehog/Gli,
  TGF-β, MAPK, and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Despite different players and
  complexities, NF-κB stands out as a common downstream effector, coupling the variety
  of molecular cascades underneath the characteristic molecular heterogeneity of this
  tumor. This figure was created using Servier Medical Art templates, which are licensed
