caption: Gene set enrichment analysis with KEGG annotations and Kolmogorov–Smirnov
  test for the entire n2v2r ranking on LUAD TCGA when comparing male against female
  PANDA regulatory networks. We present the top 30 results ranked by adjusted p-values
  that pass a 0.1 FDR cutoff (equivalent to −log padj = 1). Bold indicates pathways
  common with DeDi when performing the same analysis. The x-axis represents the normalized
  enrichment score, and color the −log padj value. The size of the points indicates
  the overlap of the leading gene sets with the pathways. Long pathway names have
  been trimmed
