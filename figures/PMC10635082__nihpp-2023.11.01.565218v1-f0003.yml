figure_title: Characterization of pyrvinium pamoate as an effective perturbagen against
  MCC
caption: (A) Simplified diagram of commercially available WNT signaling perturbagens
  in LINCS L1000 dataset and their reported MOA targeting the WNT signaling pathway.
  (B) Circos plot showing pairwise comparison between MCC signature genes (MCC1000)
  and top drug-perturbed genes (ranked by z-scored log2[fold change]) under different
  drug treatments. Statistical significance was determined by Fisherâ€™s exact test.
  (C) Cell proliferation assay in WaGa and MKL1 cells, under the treatment of pyrvinium,
  CHIR-99021 and DMSO control for 5 consecutive days. (D) Representative immunofluorescent
  images of WaGa cells treated with 500 nM pyrvinium and DMSO, with Ki67 staining
  as a proliferation marker, GAPDH as internal control, and DAPI for nucleus. (E)
  Annexin V-APC and SYTOX blue staining level were measured by flow cytometry to illustrate
  apoptotic population in WaGa cells treated with different doses and for different
  times. The bar graph on the right shows the quantification of different populations
  in WaGa cells. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired two sample T-test
