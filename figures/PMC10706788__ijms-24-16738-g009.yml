figure_title: Muffz cluster analysis of SDM from different shrimp groups.
caption: 'Muffz cluster analysis of SDM from different shrimp groups. Jsn, Jsp and
  Asp on the horizontal axis represent healthy juvenile shrimp, EHP-infected juvenile
  shrimp, and EHP-infected adult shrimp. The vertical axis represents the change in
  abundance of metabolites in each cluster. The left panel categorizes SDMs into three
  clusters based on their abundance trends: (a): This cluster represents differential
  metabolites with increasing abundance from healthy juvenile shrimp to chronically
  infected adults, (b): This cluster represents differential metabolites that decrease
  in abundance from healthy juvenile shrimp to chronically infected adults, (c): This
  cluster represents the abundance of these metabolites is altered during the early
  stage of infection and then recovers to normal levels during the later stage of
  infection. The right panel shows the KEGG topology analysis, linking these trends
  to specific metabolic pathways affected by EHP infection'
