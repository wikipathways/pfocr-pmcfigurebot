  osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs.
caption: TgESPs positively regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway during osteogenic
  differentiation of hBMSCs. (A) Western blot analysis of the levels of LEF1, DVL3,
  β-catenin and cyclin D1 proteins in TgESP-induced hBMSCs after 14 days of osteogenic
  induction. (B) Quantitative analysis of the expression of each protein. (C) Alizarin
  red S staining was used to assess the ability of hBMSCs cells to mineralize with
  TgESPs (10 µg/ml) in the presence or absence of Icg-001 (25 µM; scale bar, 500 µm).
  (D) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA levels of ALP, RUNX2,
  SPP1 and β-catenin in hBMSCs after 7 days of osteogenic induction by TgESPs in the
  presence or absence of Icg-001. (E) Western blot analysis of protein levels of Runx2,
  OPN, OSX, β-catenin and cyclin D1 in hBMSCs after 14 days of osteogenic induction
  by TgESPs in the presence or absence of Icg-001. (F) Quantitative analysis of the
  expression of each protein using β-actin as the internal control. (G) Immunofluorescence
  analysis of protein levels of Runx2 in hBMSCs after 7 days of osteogenic induction
  by Icg-001 in the presence or absence of TgESPs (scale bar, 40 µm). (H) Quantification
  of immunofluorescence in G. *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001. TgESPs, Toxoplasma gondii
  excretory/secretory proteins; hBMSCs, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells;
  Runx2, RUNX family transcription factor 2; OPN, osteopontin; OSX, osterix; ALP,
  alkaline phosphatase; SPP1, secreted phosphoprotein 1; BGLAP, bone gamma-carboxyglutamate
  protein; LEF1, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1; DVL3, dishevelled segment polarity
