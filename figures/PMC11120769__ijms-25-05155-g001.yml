  ovarian granulosa cells.
caption: 'Signaling mechanisms and role of FSH on adiponectin expression in rat ovarian
  granulosa cells. (A) Protein localization of adiponectin in the ovary. (B,C) Adiponectin
  protein levels with the addition of FSH in vitro. Green: adiponectin; Blue: cell
  nucleus. (D,E) Adiponectin protein levels with the addition of the PI3K signaling
  pathway inhibitor and activator in vitro. +/−: represents the addition or absence
  of FSH. DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; H89: PKA inhibitor; FSK: Forskolin, PKA activator;
  LY294002: an inhibitor of PI3K; and 740Y-P: a potent and cell-permeable PI3K activator.
  NC: Negative control, the negative control group of the experiment. The error bars
  represent means ± SEM (n = 3, each group). * Statistically significant values (*
  p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01); # represents no significance. Scale bars: 500 μm. GC, granulosa
  cell; TC, theca cell; and IC, interstitial cell'
