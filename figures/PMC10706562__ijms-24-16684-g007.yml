figure_title: Correlation between gut microbiota and inflammation factors, and the
  effect of MPGI on the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in the liver of mice with MASLD.
caption: 'Correlation between gut microbiota and inflammation factors, and the effect
  of MPGI on the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in the liver of mice with MASLD. Correlation
  between gut microbiota and inflammation factors at phylum level (A) and genus level
  (B). Western blot analysis of liver TLR4, pIKK β, IKK β, pIκB α, and IκB α (C).
  ND group, 1–2 wells; HFD group, 3–4 wells; MET group, 5–6 wells; PSE group, 7–8
  wells; GEN group, 9–10 wells; IQ group, 11–12 wells; MPGI group, 13–14 wells. Each
  sample is a mixture of three independent mouse livers for each group. Digitalized
  results of the Western blot analysis (D–F). The data are presented as mean ± SEM.
  ### indicates significant difference at p < 0.001 compared with the ND group; *,
  **, and *** indicate significant difference at p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001
  compared with the HFD group'
