  tumorsphere formation
caption: '(A) Immunoblot for phosphorylated ERK1/ERK2, total ERK1/ERK2, and GAPDH
  in PDGCs following CD97 knockdown. Red pixels indicate saturation. Quantification
  of densitometry ratios is also shown (phosphorylated [p]-ERK/ERK: n = 5–6 per PDGC;
  two-way ANOVA F1,17 = 8.407, p < 0.01; ERK/GAPDH: n = 5–6 per PDGC; two-way ANOVA
  F1,17 = 2.796, p > 0.05).(B) Immunoblot for p-ERK1/ERK2, total ERK1/ERK2, and GAPDH
  in a PDGC following dox-induced overexpression of CD97. Quantification of densitometry
  ratios is also shown (all isoforms compiled for each PDGC) (p-ERK/ERK: n = 4–8 per
  PDGC; two-way ANOVA F1,21 = 10.98, p < 0.01; ERK/GAPDH: n = 4–8; two-way ANOVA F1,21
  = 1.554, p > 0.05).(C) Bar graph showing that CD97 overexpression rescues lactate
  levels after CD97 knockdown (n = 3–6; ANOVA F3,15 = 25.75, p < 0.0001; Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons test: EV SCRsh vs. EV CD97sh: ***p < 0.001; CD97 rescue SCRsh vs. CD97
  rescue CD97sh: ns p > 0.05).(D) Bar graph showing restored lactate levels upon rescue
  with the MEKDD mutant (n = 3–8; ANOVA F3,19 = 8.216, p < 0.01; Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons test: EV SCRsh vs. EV CD97sh: *p < 0.05; MEKDD SCRsh vs. MEKDD CD97sh:
  ns p > 0.05).(E) Seahorse Cell Energy Phenotype graphs showing OCR and ECAR changes
  before (baseline) and after (maximal) addition of mitochondrial stressors in knockdown
  cells after introduction of the MEKDD mutant or an EV control.(F) Quantification
  of the difference in baseline OCR and ECAR between SCR and CD97 knockdown PDGCs
  after introduction of the MEKDD mutant or an EV control (n = 13 [all PDGCs compiled];
  unpaired t test; ns p > 0.05; **p < 0.01).(G) Bar graph visualizing tumorsphere
  formation following CD97 knockdown and introduction of the MEKDD mutant (n = 8–9
  per PDGC; two-way ANOVA F3,66 = 8.707, p < 0.0001; Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  test: EV SCRsh vs. EV CD97sh: **p < 0.01; MEKDD SCRsh vs. MEKDD CD97sh: ns p > 0.05).(H)
