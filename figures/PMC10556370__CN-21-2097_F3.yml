figure_title: Potential mechanisms underlying TAX-mediated neuroprotection against
  AD or CAA.
caption: Potential mechanisms underlying TAX-mediated neuroprotection against AD or
  CAA. In AD, TAX conferred neuroprotection via decreasing the level of cPLA2 to reduce
  the synthesis of PGE2, inhibiting neuroinflammation, suppressing the activation
  of APOE and ERK1/2 signaling to decrease Aβ production, up-regulating SIRT1 expression
  to inhibit Aβ-induced JAK-2/STAT3 pathway activation, and then decreasing BACE1
  expression to ultimately inhibit Aβ aggregation in neurons. In CAA, TAX promoted
  the breakdown of Aβ, inhibited Aβ oligomer formation, cleared Aβ from the brain
  to the circulation, and restored the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular
  reactivity (CVR)
