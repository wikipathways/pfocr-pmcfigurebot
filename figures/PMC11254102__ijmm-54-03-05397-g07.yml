caption: 'Western blotting was used to confirm the changes in the expression of downstream
  molecules following addition of inhibitors. (A) The induction of FFA in HepG2 cells
  after 24 h transfection with the lentivirus and Compound C was compared with that
  after transfection with the virus alone, and western blotting was used to detect
  the expression of each protein downstream in the LKB1/AMPK pathway. (B-E) Protein
  expression levels of (B) p-LKB1/LKB1, (C) p-AMPK/AMPK, (D) SREBP-1c and (E) FASN
  in each group. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001
  vs. control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. FFA group. FFA, free fatty acid;
  LKB1, liver kinase B1; AMPK, adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein
  kinase; p-, phosphorylated; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c;
  FASN, fatty acid synthase; sh, short hairpin; ns, not significant'
