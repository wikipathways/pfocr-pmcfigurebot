figure_title: The correlation between GBP5 expression and immune cell infiltration.
caption: The correlation between GBP5 expression and immune cell infiltration. (A)
  The heatmap shows the Spearman correlation between CIBERSORT scores and expression
  levels of the prognostic biomarkers. The significance is shown by “*,” “*” stands
  for p-Value < 0.05, “**” as p-Value < 0.01, “***” as p-Value < 0.001, blocks without
  “*” mark means result without significance. (B) GBP5 expression level in various
  ovarian cancer molecular subtypes. The sample capacity and the p-Value are listed
  at the figure top. (C) GBP5 expression level in various immune subtypes. OC samples
  are divided into four subtypes, including C1 (wound healing), C2 (IFN-gamma dominant),
  C3 (inflammatory), and C4 (lymphocyte depleted). The sample capacity and the p-Value
  are listed at the figure top. (D) The ssGSEA algorithm illustrated the enriched
  immune function pathways. “***” means p-Value < 0.001. (E) The result of ssGSEA
  analysis, to show the distribution of immune cells divided by the expression of
  GBP5. “*” means p-Value < 0.05, “**” means p-Value < 0.01, “***” means p-Value <
  0.001, “ns” means the result lacks significance
