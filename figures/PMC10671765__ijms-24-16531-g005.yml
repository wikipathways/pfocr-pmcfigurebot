caption: 'The activation of glucose metabolism markers was enhanced by the AMPK signaling
  pathway in granulosa cells (in vitro). (A) Scheme of the in vitro experiment. KGN
  cells and primary theca cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with 70 mM
  TAA and PD-MSCs. (B–E) In theca cells, the mRNA expression of IGFBP2, IGF-1, AMPK,
  SIRT1, and GLUT4 was analyzed via qRT-PCR. (F–J) In granulosa cells, the mRNA expression
  of IGFBP2, IGF-1, AMPK, and SIRT1 was analyzed via qRT-PCR. (K) The protein expression
  of AMPK and GLUT4 was analyzed using Western blotting. (L,M) The Western blot bands
  of AMPK and GLUT4 gene were quantified using ImageJ. The data represent the mean
  ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by using a one-way ANOVA. Note: *
  p < 0.05, theca cell/granulosa cell vs. NTx; * p < 0.05, NTx vs. Tx'
