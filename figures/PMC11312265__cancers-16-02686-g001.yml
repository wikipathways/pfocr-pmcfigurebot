  signaling pathway.
caption: Molecular mechanisms of inhibited and activated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligands, LRP5/6 and Frizzled receptors remain spatially
  separated. The “destruction complex” consisting of Axin, APC, GSK3β, and CK1α phosphorylates
  β-catenin and marks it for β-TrCP1/2-dependent ubiquitination and neddylation for
  subsequent proteasomal degradation. Upon Wnt ligand binding to Frizzled, LRP5/6
  and Frizzled receptors interact and subsequently recruit Dishevelled, which in turn
  recruits GSK3β and Axin and favors their phosphorylation. In the absence of active
  GSK3β and Axin, the “destruction complex” cannot form. β-catenin is stabilized and
  diffuses into the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF and induces transcriptional
  activation of downstream genes. This illustration was created with BioRender.com
