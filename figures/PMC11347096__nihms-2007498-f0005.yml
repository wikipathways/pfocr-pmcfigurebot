caption: The schematic diagram summarizes the regulation of lipid metabolism in normal
  or malignant B cells. In response to foreign antigens, BCR signaling triggers a
  pro-inflammatory immune response via activation of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and
  promotes intensive proliferation supported by various lipid species such as fatty
  acids, PG, CL, sphingolipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol. In B cell malignancy,
  constitutive BCR signaling, achieved by mutations in genes such as BCR-ABL1 in early
  B cell leukemia or PI3K, MYC, PTEN, CD79B, CARD11, MYD88, and RAS in mature B cell
  lymphoma, contributes to uncontrolled cell proliferation, survival, and drug resistance
