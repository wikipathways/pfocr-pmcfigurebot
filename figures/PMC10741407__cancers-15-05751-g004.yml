  from a donor (SAM) to the histone, (b) the G9a-GLP complex is responsible for the

  of H3K9.
caption: Lysine Histone Methyltransferases (KMTs) (a) KMT transfers a methyl from
  a donor (SAM) to the histone, (b) the G9a-GLP complex is responsible for the mono-methylation
  of H3K9 histone, but G9a is responsible for the di- and tri-methylation of H3K9.
  (c) G9a activity under normoxia contributes to the prompt di-methylation of H3K9,
  but under hypoxia it increases the global di-methylation of H3K9, silencing the
  gene responsible for E-cadherin expression, affecting the adhesion between cells,
  contributing to metastasis, and activating the Notch-1 signaling pathway which contributes
  to cancer cell survival and proliferation. Red arrowsâ€”up arrow is an indicative
  of upregulation
