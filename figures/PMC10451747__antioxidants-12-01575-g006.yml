figure_title: Effect of PD-MSCs on the antioxidant signaling pathway.
caption: Effect of PD-MSCs on the antioxidant signaling pathway. The positive superoxide
  signals (i.e., MitoSOX) and mitochondria signals (i.e., MitoTracker) in the ovarian
  tissues of 1/2 OVX rats 1, 3 and 5 weeks after transplantation were analyzed via
  IF staining (A). The ratio of MitoSOX intensity to MitoTracker intensity in the
  ovarian tissues of 1/2 OVX rats 1, 3, and 5 weeks after transplantation was analyzed
  using the ImageJ program (mean ± SE). The white dotted lines indicate the follicles
  in ovarian tissue (B). The gene expression of SOD1 (C) and catalase (D) in the ovarian
  tissues of 1/2 OVX rats 1, 3 and 5 weeks after transplantation were analyzed via
  Western blotting (mean ± SE). The levels of oxidized glutathione in the serum of
  individual 1/2 OVX rats 1, 3 and 5 weeks after transplantation were analyzed using
  ELISA (mean ± SE) (E). Significance at p < 0.05 is indicated with an asterisk (*)
