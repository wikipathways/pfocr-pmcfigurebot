figure_title: Transcriptional analysis of RNF185 KD MPC3 cells and comparison analysis
  with clinical transcriptomics reveals EMT pathway activation and collagen upregulation
caption: '(A) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot of MPC3-pLKO and MPC3-shRNF185
  #1 and #3 biological replicates. (B) Heatmap comparing significantly altered diseases
  and functions in MPC3-shRNF185 #1 and #3 compared to MPC3-pLKO. (C) GSEA enrichment
  plots showing enrichment of the EMT hallmark gene set in MPC3-shRNF185 #1 and #3
  relative to MPC3-pLKO, and in TCGAâ€™s PRAD patients with low RNF185 mRNA expression
  (bottom 25%) relative to those with high expression (top 25%). (D) Venn Diagrams
  of enriched genes from HALLMARK_EMT in MPC3-shRNF185 #1 and #3 cells and in low
  RNF185 expressing patients from TCGA dataset. (E) qRT-PCR analysis of COL5A2 and
  COL3A1 in MPC3-pLKO and MPC3-shRNF185 cells, and in the human prostate cancer line
  PC3 transfected with RNF185 siRNA. Box plots show median and whiskers.'
