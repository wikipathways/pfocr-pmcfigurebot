caption: 'The effect of CD on the expression of genes involved in the NFkB signaling
  pathway: NF-κB1 (A), NF-κB2 (B), IKBκB (C), NFκBIA (D), NIK (E) and RELA (F). Graph
  bars show control, CD (6.25 µM), LPS and CD cotreatment (CD (1 h before) + LPS.
  Data represent normalized expression as the mean ± SEM, the statistical significance
  of the difference between LPS and different treatments was determined using a one-way
  ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests. * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01 *** p ≤ 0.001,
  **** p ≤ 0.0001, ns = nonsignificant'
