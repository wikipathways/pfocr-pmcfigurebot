figure_title: The NO pathway in cardiac myocytes.
caption: The NO pathway in cardiac myocytes. A schematic illustration of Ca2+ fluxes
  during excitation-contraction in ventricular cardiomyocytes. This diagram depicts
  the most representative protein complexes and intercellular organelles involved
  in the cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Efficient systolic contraction and
  diastolic relaxation is reliant on efficient Ca2+ handling through several processes.
  Diffusion of Ca2+ into the cytosol through LTCC, L-type Ca2+ channel; Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release
  from the ryanodine receptors (RyRs); Sequestration of Ca2+ back in to the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum via the important Ca2+ pump sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA);
  and Expulsion of Ca2+ from the cell via sodium-calcium exchanger pumps (NCX); PLB,
  phopholamban; Ca2+, calcium
