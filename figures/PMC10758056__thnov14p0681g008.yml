figure_title: NRF2 promotes radiation resistance by cooperating with TOPBP1 to activate
  the ATR-CHK1 signaling pathway
caption: Schematic model showing that NRF2 was translocated to DSB sites, promoted
  the phosphorylation of RPA32, and activated the ATR/CHK1 pathway by recruiting TOPBP1
  to DNA damage sites
