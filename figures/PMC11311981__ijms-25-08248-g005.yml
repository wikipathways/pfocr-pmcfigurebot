caption: 'KEGG functional enrichment analysis of DEMs. (A) Enrichment bubble plots
  of KEGG metabolic pathways for DEMs. (B) Heatmap of metabolites enriched in the
  tyrosine metabolic pathway across samples. (C) Boxplots of the content of several
  metabolites in different tissues. In the figure: “ns” indicates no significant difference,
  “*” indicates p < 0.05, “**” indicates p < 0.01, “***” indicates p < 0.001, “****”
  indicates p < 0.0001'
