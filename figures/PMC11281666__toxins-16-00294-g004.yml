figure_title: Bubbles of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathways of
  the DEGs.
caption: 'Bubbles of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathways of the
  DEGs. The size of bubbles represents the number of DEGs enriched in the pathway,
  the colors of bubbles indicate higher enrichment (lower p-value) in red: (A) KEGG
  enrichment analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes in the 15-ADON
  group; and (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of significantly differentially expressed
  genes in the DON group'
