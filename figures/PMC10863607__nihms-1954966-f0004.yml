figure_title: Metabolic pathway associated with T3 chemicals.
caption: Metabolic pathway associated with T3 chemicals. Pathway enrichment analysis
  with metabolites of two network communities in Fig. 3 was conducted using mummichog.
  A) Seven pathways were found altered with F18 chemical in C1and B) eight pathways
  were altered with chemicals (F19-F21) in C2 (p < 0.05). The ratio of selected metabolites
  mapped to the listed pathway over the number of total pathway metabolites detected
  is provided to the right of each bar
