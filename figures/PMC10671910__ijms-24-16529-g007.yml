caption: 'DEGs in Acinetobacter lwoffii NL115 in response to phenol stress. (A) Venn
  diagrams for RNA-seq of the two strains on phenol-containing medium and NaAc medium.
  PHNA_ALE and PHNA_WT: A. lwoffii NL115 and A. lwoffii NL1 were cultivated on the
  medium containing 1.3 g/L NaAc and 0.5 g/L phenol, respectively. NA_ALE and NA_WT:
  A. lwoffii NL115 and A. lwoffii NL1 were cultivated on 1.3 g/L NaAc medium. (B)
  Pathways enriched in Acinetobacter lwoffii NL115 in response to phenol stress. The
  ordinate corresponds to the number of KO categories in each metabolic pathway'
