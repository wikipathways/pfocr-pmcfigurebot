caption: 'Application of nanotechnology in breast cancer and PMA treatment targeting
  TRPA1 inhibition. (a) Nanoparticle-encapsulated antagonist DIPMA-MK-3207, a pH-responsive
  nanoparticle targeting endosomal CLR/RAMP1, enhances CGRP-induced pain relief efficacy
  by blocking TRPA1-related signaling.; (b) photothermal conjugated polymer nanoparticles
  (NPs-H) encapsulating HC-030031 (HC), a specific inhibitor of the near-infrared
  (NIR)-responsive TRPA1 ion channel, block the formation of Ca2+/CaM complexes when
  exposed to an 808 nm laser. As a result, chemotherapy resistance is reduced and
  tumor cell death is promoted. Red arrows: Pathway of disease suppression by nanoparticles,
  blue arrows: Pathway of disease development by TRPA1 activation'
