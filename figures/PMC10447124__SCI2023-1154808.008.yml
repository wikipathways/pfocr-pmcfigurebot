figure_title: (a) Mapping of Rap1 signaling pathway in NI vs.
caption: (a) Mapping of Rap1 signaling pathway in NI vs. CO shows that the p38 MAPK
  pathway is significantly involved. (b) Mapping of the Wnt signaling pathway in NI
  vs. CO shows that the canonical Wnt pathway is significantly involved in this process.
  Each gene is colored according to its expression level in the pathway and significantly
  upregulated genes are marked in red and significantly downregulated genes are marked
  in green
