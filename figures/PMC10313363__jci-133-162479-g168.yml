figure_title: Improved whole-body metabolism in Cdk4R/R mice
caption: '(A) Glucose tolerance and (B) insulin sensitivity in Cdk4R/R mice compared
  with those in Cdk4WT mice. (C) Body weight, (D) fat mass, (E) lean mass, (F) fasting
  and fed blood glucose levels, (G) glucose tolerance, and (H) insulin sensitivity
  in Cdk4R/R mice and Cdk4WT mice in response to 60% HFD. (I) Histology of white adipose
  (WAT) (top) and liver tissues (bottom) from HFD-fed Cdk4R/R mice and similarly fed
  Cdk4WT mice. Scale bars: 100 μm. (J) Whole-body and (K) skeletal muscle glucose
  uptake during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp assay in regular chow–fed Cdk4R/R
  mice compared with Cdk4WT mice. (L) Phosphorylation levels of insulin signaling
  pathway intermediatory proteins, IRS-1 and Akt, in Cdk4R/R muscle in comparison
  to Cdk4WT muscle. Total IRS-1,Akt, and α-tubulin proteins are shown as controls.
  (M) Energy expenditure, (N) ambulatory activity, (O) RER, and (P) muscle exercise
  work in Cdk4R/R mice and Cdk4WT mice (n = 9–11 mice each group). Between 6 and 8
  mice per group fed regular chow were used in each experiment, unless mentioned otherwise.
  Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by 2-tailed
  Student’s t test'
