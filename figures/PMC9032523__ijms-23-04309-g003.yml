caption: “NAM drain” concomitantly affects NAD+ salvage pathway and methionine cycle.
  Excessive nicotinamide (NAM) clearance by its nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT)-mediated
  methylation excludes NAM from the salvage pathway and consumes methyl units from
  S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to generate N1-methylnicotinamide and S-adenosyl homocysteine
  (SAH). Enzyme S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHase) converts SAH into homocysteine
  (Hcy). Conditions of high NAD+ consumption and liberation of NAM, as well as excessive
  dietary intake of vitamin B3, promote “NAM drain”-mediated clearance of surplus
  NAM. This process stalls NAD+synthesis in the salvage pathway, decreases methylation
  potential of the cell and augments the generation of (Hcy).
