caption: A summary of the targeting of cancer pathways by phytochemicals. Multiple
  phytochemicals isolated from multiple different species and families of plants act
  on what are termed the hallmarks of cancer. These are the processes that define
  the transition from normal cells to cancer cells. Despite these compounds being
  derived from a wide range of plants, they target very common pathways. These include
  immune evasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, proliferation, and the inhibition of cell
  death
