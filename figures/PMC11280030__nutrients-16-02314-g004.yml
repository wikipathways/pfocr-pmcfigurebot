figure_title: Metabolic profiling in serum from APAP-exposed mice treated with or
  without C.
caption: Metabolic profiling in serum from APAP-exposed mice treated with or without
  C. minuta. (A) orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis
  (OPLS-DA) score plots in positive and negative ionization modes. (B) Volcano plot
  for different metabolites in positive and negative ion modes. (C) Unsupervised hierarchical
  clustering heatmap of the top 50 different metabolites. (D) Spearmanâ€™s correlation
  analysis between the top 50 DMs and ALT and AST. (E) Top 20 pathways analyzed by
  KEGG. Control in the figure represents the APAP + PBS group; Treated represents
  the APAP + C. minuta. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
