  Effects of i.c.v. injection with Aβ1–42 oligomers in young and aged mice on MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Enrichment plots (a–e) for core enrichment genes were generated by GSEA using the WP (a), KEGG (b–e) gene sets. Comparison identified the enrichment of the “PI3KAKT signaling pathway” ((a); NES −2.08, FDR 0.03) and “MTOR signaling pathway” ((b); NES −2.11, FDR 0.03) gene sets in 18Aβ vs. 3Vh, the enrichment plot of the “MTOR signaling pathway” ((c); NES −2.11, FDR 0.03), and “MAPK signaling pathway” ((e); NES −1.83, FDR 0.03) gene sets in 18Aβ vs. 3Aβ, and “MAPK signaling pathway” ((d); NES 1.21, FDR 0.77) gene set in 18Aβ vs. 18Vh. The protein levels of p-Akt (f), p-GSK3β (g), p-ERK1/2 (h), and Mapkapk5 (i) were determined by Western blotting in the hippocampal samples at 60, 46, 42/44, and 58 kDa, respectively, and using Akt, GSK3β, ERK1/2 and β-actin (42 kDa) as loading control. Top: representative images of the protein of interest expressions. Bottom: quantitative analysis of the Western blotting results. The graphs show densitometry analysis of the bands appertaining to the protein of interest. The values are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 7) of each group. ((f): * p < 0.05 18Aβ vs. 3Vh, §
