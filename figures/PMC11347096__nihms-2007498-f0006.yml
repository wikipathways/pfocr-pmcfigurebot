caption: The schematic diagram summarizes the potential therapeutic targets of different
  lipid species and related pathways to treat inflammatory disease or B cell malignancy.
  Multiple studies have demonstrated promising immunomodulatory or therapeutic effects
  of small molecules targeting different layers of lipid metabolism in B cells. Combined
  treatment with FDA-approved small molecules and drugs for B cell malignancies such
  as imatinib, ibrutinib, dacinostat, CAL-101, and T-5224 can produce synergistic
  effects, enhancing therapeutic efficacy and offering a broader array of strategies
  for personalized treatment. All the figures were generated using biorender.com
