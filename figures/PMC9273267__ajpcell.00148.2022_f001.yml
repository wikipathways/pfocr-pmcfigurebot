caption: The essence of ferroptosis is iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Fe3+ circulating
  in the bloodstream is endocytosed as the Fe3+-TF-TFR1 complex. In the cell, Fe3+
  is dissociated from TF and is reduced to Fe2+ by STEAP3, and Fe2+ is stored in ferritin.
  NCOA4 promotes Fe2+ to be released from ferritin and enters the labile iron pool,
  which participates in multiple cellular processes and the Fenton reaction. The phospholipids
  containing PUFA chain are generated from PUFAs by ACSL4 and LPCAT3, which are peroxidized
  through the Fenton reaction to form toxic lipid hydroperoxides. The process of lipid
  peroxidation is antagonized by the GSH-GPX4 pathway. System xc− transports cystine
  into the cell, which is reduced to cysteine, the rate-limiting precursor of GSH.
  GPX4 uses GSH as a cofactor to convert lipid hydroperoxides to nontoxic lipid alcohols,
  thereby inhibiting ferroptosis. ACSL4, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member
