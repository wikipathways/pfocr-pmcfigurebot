figure_title: KEGG analysis of DE mRNAs.
caption: KEGG analysis of DE mRNAs. Enrichment and screening of KEGG pathway in C
  group and V group resulted in 325 signaling pathways, involving IL-17 signaling
  pathway, interaction of viral protein with cytokine and cytokine receptor, p53 signaling
  pathway, TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine
  signaling pathway, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway (A,B,E). 286 signaling
  pathways were obtained by enrichment and screening of the KEGG pathway in the V
  group and the SV group, which mainly involved primary immunodeficiency, natural
  killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, NF-κB signaling pathway, B-cell receptor signaling
  pathway, FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interaction and TNF signaling pathway (C,D,F)
