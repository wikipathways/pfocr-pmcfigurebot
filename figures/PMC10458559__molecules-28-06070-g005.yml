caption: The effects of CEP on the NRF2/HO-1/NQO-1, and AMPK-α1/AKT/GSK-3β signaling
  pathways. (A–D) Western blot analysis of the impact of CEP on the expression of
  NRF2 (B), HO-1 (C), and NQO-1 (D) signaling pathway in LPS-induced macrophages (n
  = 3). (E–H) Western blot analysis of the impact of CEP on the phosphorylation of
  the AMPK-α1 (F), AKT (G), and GSK-3β (H) signaling pathways in LPS-induced macrophages
  (n = 3). The results shown are means ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p <
  0.001
