  of Fgf23 mRNA
caption: (A) RT-qPCR analysis of Sost mRNA in IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM D-BAIBA over
  a 72-h time course. Sost mRNA expression was increased at 24 h and 48 h but returned
  to basal levels by 72 h. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 4 biological replicates
  per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. 0 h) are calculated using
  one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons.(B) Quantification of sclerostin
  protein in conditioned media from L- and D-BAIBA-treated IDG-SW3 at 24 h. 10 μM
  D-BAIBA elevated the secretion of sclerostin protein more than 2-fold compared to
  controls. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 4 biological replicates per condition),
  and p values (*p < 0.05) are calculated using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple
  comparisons.(C) RT-qPCR analysis of Fgf23 mRNA in IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM D-BAIBA
  in the presence of AbD09097, a sclerostin-neutralizing antibody, for 72 h. 1,000
  pg/mL AbD09097 blocked D-BAIBA-induced Fgf23 mRNA expression. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates per condition), and p values (***p < 0.001)
  are calculated using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(D and E) Immunoblotting
  of phospho NF-κB p65 and total NF-κB p65 (D) in whole-cell lysate from 10 μM D-BAIBA-treated
  IDG-SW3. (E) Quantification of the immunoblots. D-BAIBA enhanced a 4- to 6-fold
  of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation after 24–72 h. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n =
  3 biological replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) are
  calculated using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons.(F–I) RT-qPCR
  analysis of Sost and Fgf23 mRNA expression in IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM D-BAIBA
  in the presence of BMS345541, an NF-κB inhibitor for 0–24 h (F), 24–48 h (G), 24–72
  h (H), and 48–72 h (I). 500 nM BMS345541 completely blocked D-BAIBA-induced Sost
  mRNA expression when treated between 0 and 24 h, but Fgf23 mRNA showed no changes.
  Both Sost and Fgf23 mRNA expressions were elevated by D-BAIBA at 48 h, which were
  reduced by the treatment of BMS345541 between 24 and 48 h. The treatment of BMS345541
  for 24–72 h blocked a late induction of Fgf23 by D-BAIBA, and 48–72 h of treatment
  of BMS345541 partially reduced D-BAIBA-elevated Fgf23 mRNA, but Sost mRNA showed
  no changes except a reduction by D-BAIBA in the presence of 500 nM BMS345541 at
  72 h. All data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3 or 4 biological replicates per
  condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) are calculated using
  two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(J) BAIBA signaling pathway. D-BAIBA
  utilizes Gαi/NF-κB/sclerostin/NF-κB signaling pathway downstream of MRGPRD to regulate
  Fgf23 mRNA. BMS34551 is an inhibitor of NF-κB, and AbO09097 is an antibody against
  sclerostin
