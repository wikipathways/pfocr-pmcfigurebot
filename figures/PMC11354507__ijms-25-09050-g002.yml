figure_title: Inflammation triggered by macrophage after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
caption: 'Inflammation triggered by macrophage after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Activation
  of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) occurs when they recognise pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs). These patterns are typically found in foreign organisms, such
  as bacteria and viruses. TLR localisation can occur on either the cell surface (TLR-1,
  -2, -4, -5, -6, -10) or in intracellular compartments such as endosomes (TLR-3,
  -7, -8, -9). The ability to recognise viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) implies
  its potential for SARS-CoV-2 clearance of SARS-CoV-2. These receptors detect signals
  and initiate NF-κB and IRF activation. Activation can occur through the MyD88-dependent
  and MyD88-independent pathways, ultimately leading to the expression of cytokines
  and interferon (IFN-I). The binding of viral RNA to RIG-I or MDA5 prompts the creation
  of MAVS polymers in mitochondria, followed by the subsequent attachment of TRAFs.
  TRAFs activate the NF-κB, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), mainly IRF-3
  and IRF-7. This process leads to the expression of antiviral interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytosolic DNA sensors, primarily cGAS
  detect viral DNA, including dsDNA from DNA viruses or reverse-transcribed DNA from
  retroviruses. Upon binding to dsDNA, cGAS becomes activated and catalyses the production
  of a second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP binds and activates STING, which
  recruits and activates TBK1. Activated TBK1 phosphorylates the transcription factor
  IRF3 leading to the expression of ISGs. Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway by IFN
  and cytokines initiates the innate immune response against viral infections. The
  role of this pathway is critical in various physiological and pathological processes
  like cancer development, inflammation, tissue damage, and viral infections. The
  binding of Type I IFN to IFNα receptors (IFNAR) activates JAKs, which in turn phosphorylates
  and moves STATs to the nucleus. This process leads to the expression of antiviral
  ISGs. Once the STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer is formed, it binds to IRF9 to create the
  transcriptionally active ISGF3. The early immune response to viral infections heavily
  relies on the activation of the Jak2/STAT3 signalling pathway by Il-6, which facilitates
  virus clearance through neutrophils. The IL-6 protein binds to the IL-6R receptor,
  which is composed of the IL-6α receptor molecule and the gp130 signal transducer,
  allowing cell signalling. JAK2 activation induced by IL-6 through gp130 results
  in the activation of STATs, particularly STAT3. Abbreviations: ISGs—interferon-stimulated
