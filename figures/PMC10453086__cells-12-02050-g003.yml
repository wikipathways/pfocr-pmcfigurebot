figure_title: Downregulation of cholesterol synthesis pathway significantly enhanced
  3D spheroid formation of diverse cell types.
caption: Downregulation of cholesterol synthesis pathway significantly enhanced 3D
  spheroid formation of diverse cell types. (A) Venn diagram showing overlap between
  DEGs (cutoff > 1.7-fold difference) in 3D vs. 2D conditions for each cell type.
  (B) GO terms enriched among DEGs of 3D vs. 2D conditions for each cell type. (C)
  Significant enrichment and downregulation of the cholesterol synthesis pathway genes
  via GSEA in ESCs, MSCs, and cancer cells cultured in 3D vs. 2D conditions. (D) IPA-based
  pathway analysis for the cholesterol synthesis pathway of 3D- vs. 2D-cultured MSCs.
  Upregulated genes are indicated in red and downregulated genes in green. Solid and
  dashed lines indicate direct and indirect interactions, respectively. Genes in gray
  are generated based on IPA and not from transcriptome data. Results and individual
  gene expression levels for 3D- vs. 2D-cultured ESCs and cancer cells are shown in
  Figure S2. (E) qPCR analysis for expression levels of cholesterol synthesis enzymes
  24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr24), methylsterol monooxygenase 1 (Msmo1),
  and squalene epoxidase (Sqle) in ESCs, MSCs, and cancer cells cultured in 2D and
  3D conditions; Gapdh, internal control. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. ***, p
  < 0.001, and ****, p < 0.0001, compared with 2D cultured conditions. (F) Phase contrast
  microscopy of 3D-cultured ESCs, MSCs, and cancer cells treated with the cholesterol
  synthesis inhibitor mevastatin (Mev; 1 μM), depletion of cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin
  (MβCD; 1.5 mM), or addition of cholesterol (1.5 mM MβCD + 100 μg/mL cholesterol
  condition). Scale bar, 100 μm. Bar figures represent quantification of area of 3D
  spheroids. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, and ****,
  p < 0.0001 compared to 3D control or between conditions as indicated by bar
