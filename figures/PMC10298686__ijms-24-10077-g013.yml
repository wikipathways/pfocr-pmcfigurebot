caption: TGF-β signaling pathway modulates spheroid formation and DNER expression.
  (A) Phase contrast microscope images (20×) of spheroid formation of SNU-638 after
  14 days of spheroid culture in the presence of the indicated inhibitors. A scale
  bar of 500 µm. Hedgehog inhibitor (GDC-0449, 10 µM); γ-secretase inhibitor for Notch
  signaling (LY411575, 10 µM); TGF-β inhibitor (SB431542, 10 µM); ROCK inhibitor (Y27632,
  10 µM); and tankyrase1/2 inhibitor for Wnt signaling (XAV-939, 10 µM). (B,C) The
  DNER transcript level (B) and protein level (C) in spheroid-cultured SNU-638 cells
  for 14 days was determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. GAPDH was
  measured to monitor the inputted RNA amount in RT-PCR and to monitor the protein
  loading in Western blotting. (D) DNER protein level in SNU-638 cells treated with
  an indicated amount of TGF-β for three days was examined by Western blotting. The
  protein level of DNER normalized against that of GAPDH. The intensity of each protein
  band was quantitated with ImageJ software. Data shown are fold increases over the
  untreated control. (E). The expression of DNER in SNU-638 cells transfected with
  siSC or siSMAD4 and grown under adherent (A) and spheroid (S) cultured conditions
  was examined by Western blotting. The band intensity was quantitated and analyzed
  as described above. Data shown are fold increases over the siSC-transfected cells
  grown in adherent conditions. All quantitative data shown here are the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. * represents p < 0.05
