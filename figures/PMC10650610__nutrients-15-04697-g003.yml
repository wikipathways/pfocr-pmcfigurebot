caption: Correlation between 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and immune cells. (a–c). The relationship
  between serum 1,25(OH)₂D₃ levels in patients with different immunological data was
  evaluated and revealed a significant negative correlation between serum 1,25(OH)₂D₃
  and the counts of T cells and frequency of CD8+ T cells/ T cells and IFN+ CD8+ T
  cells/ CD8+ T cells. (d). Volcano plot of detectable mRNA profiles in participants
  receiving vitamin D (n = 47) or placebo (n = 47). Red and blue plots represent aberrantly
  expressed mRNAs with p < 0.05 and absolute log2FC > 2, and grey plots indicate transcripts
  not significantly changed. The abscissa means the value of fold change in mRNA expression.
  The ordinate shows the −log10 of the p-value for each mRNA, representing the strength
  of the association. (e). A plot heatmap showing the top 50 gene expression profiles
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The magnitude of change for each variable
  is indicated by the color gradient. The most intense shades of red in the red gradient
  represent the greatest magnitudes of change for the dependent variable. As the color
  gradient becomes whiter, it indicates no change in the dependent variable. As the
  color gradient flows from white to more intense shades of blue, it indicates a decrease
  in the values of the dependent variable. (f) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  revealed that DEGs involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and AMPK signaling
  pathways were enriched significantly in the participants receiving vitamin D. AMPK,
