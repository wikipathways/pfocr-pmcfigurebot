figure_title: Modulation of the actin cytoskeleton within the foot processes.
caption: 'Modulation of the actin cytoskeleton within the foot processes. At the SD,
  nephrin acts as a signaling hub to interact with other proteins. Nephrin interacts
  with CD2AP with a subunit of PI3K and then activates the Akt kinase pathway, leading
  to actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. The adaptor protein Nck binds to phosphorylated
  nephrin and N-WASP, stimulating the Arp2/3 complex, which triggers actin polymerization.
  The scaffolding protein IQGAP1 interacts with nephrin and regulates actin dynamin.
  In DKD, insulin modulates actin cytoskeleton rearrangement by activating TRPC6,
  affecting AMPKα and PKGIα, and then regulating RhoA and Rac1. These interactions
  can regulate the PAK/cofilin-dependent signaling pathway. Dynamin functions in endocytosis
  and regulates the scission and release of vesicles. Rabs are localized in close
  proximity to vesicles within FPs and serve as predominant mediators of vesicle trafficking
  while closely interacting with cytoskeleton proteins. Abbreviations: FPs: foot processes;
