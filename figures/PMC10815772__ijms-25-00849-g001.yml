caption: 'FGF/FGFR and downstream signaling pathway. Description: The binding of FGF
  ligands to FGFRs leads to receptor dimerization, conformational changes, and phosphorylation
  (P in figure) of kinases, leading to the interaction of adaptor protein FRS2 (FGFR
  substrate 2) with SHP2 (Src homology-2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2),
  GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound 2), SOS (son of sevenless). This subsequently
  leads to the downstream activation of the PI3K, and MAPK signaling pathways. In
  addition, the activation of JAK-STAT and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways occurs
  independently of FRS2. The activation of the PKC pathway occurs via binding of phospholipase
  C-gamma (PLCÎ³) to phosphotyrosine, causing hydrolyzation of PIP2 (Phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate) to PIP3 (Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol),
  which in turn leads to activation of PKC and MAPK pathways'
