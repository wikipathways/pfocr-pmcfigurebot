figure_title: Expression profile of selected unigenes.
caption: Expression profile of selected unigenes. (a) Expression of key enzyme genes
  in the biosynthetic pathway of phenolic acids. The expression levels of biosynthetic
  genes at different times of drought treatment were presented in a heatmap using
  line normalization criteria. FPKM values of unigenes were transformed by log2. The
  redder the color, the higher the expression level, and the bluer the color, the
  lower the expression level. (b) Correlation expression profile of selected laccases
  with SmRAS1 and SmCYP98A14. After FPKM normalization, 7 of the 50 unigenes annotated
  as LAC were found to have similar expression trends to SmRAS1 and SmCYP98A14
