figure_title: Three photosensitive SLE models show upregulated IFN-related gene expression
  in non-lesional skin by QuSAGE analysis
caption: (A–I) RNAseq analysis of gene expression and pathway analyses from MRL/lpr
  (LPR) and control MRL/+ (MRL) (A–D), B6.Sle1yaa and control B6 mice (E), and IMQ
  and control B6 mice (F–I). For the IMQ model, mice were painted on one ear (ipsilateral)
  and the unpainted ear (contralateral) was taken as the non-lesional ear. (A, E,
  F) PCA using top 500 genes. (B, G) Differentially expressed pathways determined
  by QuSAGE pathway analysis against MSigDB. (C, H) Volcano plot of differentially
  expressed genes. Genes from IFN-α/β (red), IFN-γ (blue), and IRF transcription factor
  (green) pathways are marked. (D, I) Heatmap of z-score transformed gene expression
  in the IFN α/β signaling pathway. (A, E, F) Each symbol represents one mouse.
