figure_title: Breast milk and different infant formulae effects on cell junction assembly
  and regulation.
caption: 'Breast milk and different infant formulae effects on cell junction assembly
  and regulation. (a) NES value of GSEA enrichment for breast milk and infant formulae.
  Here, treat infant formulae as one group: PMF. (b) Inter-PMF comparison of cell
  junction-related GO biological processes enriched by GSEA. NES of each GO term for
  each infant formula group was visualized. (c) mRNA level of claudin-1 (CLDN1) and
  ZO-1 (TJP1) quantified by RT-qPCR (2−ΔΔCt method). (d) Hierarchical clustered heatmap
  of expression of core enrichment genes in tight junction pathway. Genes were clustered
  in three modules, representing certain infant formula groups’ relatively higher
  expressed genes. (e) Protein–protein interactions, respectively, from each clustered
  module’s genes. Left-Up: from module representing PMF1. Right-Up: from module representing
  PMF3. Middle-Down: from module representing PMF2. All data are presented as mean
  ± SEM. ** p < 0.01; ns, no significance, p ≥ 0.05'
