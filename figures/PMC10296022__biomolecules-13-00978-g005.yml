figure_title: Dexamethasone modulated collagen-related protein kinase signaling pathways
  with the possible involvement of GR target genes in human dermal fibroblasts.
caption: 'Dexamethasone modulated collagen-related protein kinase signaling pathways
  with the possible involvement of GR target genes in human dermal fibroblasts. (A,B)
  Whole-cell lysates were prepared from Hs68 cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide
  (DMSO; CON) or 1 μM dexamethasone (DEX) for 24 h. Protein phosphorylation was analyzed
  using a phosphokinase array. The bar graph shows the changes in protein phosphorylation
  in dexamethasone-treated cells compared with those in DMSO-treated cells. (C) Hs68
  cells were pretreated with non-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) or siRNAs
  targeting ARID5B, FKBP5, LOX, MTHFD2, ZFP36, or ZHX3 for 48 h, then treated with
  dexamethasone for further 24 h. The protein levels of phospho-p38, total p38 (t-38),
  phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), total JNK (t-JNK), Phospho-cAMP response
  element-binding protein (CREB), total CREB (t-CREB), phospho-p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K),
  and total p70S6K (t-p70S6K) were determined using immunoblotting. (D,E) Hs68 cells
  were pretreated with non-targeting siRNA (CON) or siRNAs targeting ZFP36 or ZHX3
  for 48 h, followed by treatment with dexamethasone vehicle (DMSO) for another 24
  h. The protein levels of phospho-p38, t-38, Phospho-CREB, and t-CREB were determined
  using immunoblotting. The data are represented as the mean ± standard error of the
  mean (SEM) of two (A,B) or three (C,D,E) replicates. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001 (vs. CON); # p < 0.05 (vs. DEX); ns, not significant'
