caption: Transcriptome analysis of urine-derived podocytes treated with and without
  losartan. Comparative transcriptome and Gene Ontology analysis of urine-derived
  UM51 podocytes treated with and without 1 μM losartan. Expressed genes (det- p <
  0.05) in UM51 derived podocytes treated with and without 1 μM losartan compared
  in the Venn diagram (A) show distinct (1219 in untreated podocytes and 94 in podocytes
  treated with 1 μM losartan) gene expression patterns. In total, 13,413 genes were
  found to be expressed in common between untreated podocytes and podocytes treated
  with 1 μM losartan. Podocytes treated with 1 μM losartan showed the most over-represented
  GO BP-terms associated with regulation of monoatomic ion transmembrane transporter
  activity, cell morphogenesis involved in neuron differentiation, and cell–cell communication
  (B,D). The 94 significant genes associated with KEGG pathways revealed vascular
  smooth muscle contraction, oxytocin signaling pathway, renin secretion, and ECM-receptor
  interaction (C)
