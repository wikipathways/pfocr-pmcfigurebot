figure_title: Top enriched signaling pathways in mice treated with vehicle or BIO
  300 with TBI.
caption: Top enriched signaling pathways in mice treated with vehicle or BIO 300 with
  TBI. Top 25 canonical pathways identified using IPA that have a Fisherâ€™s exact test
  p < 0.05 and an absolute z-score > 2 in animals treated with vehicle or BIO 300
  (200 mg/kg, BID) prior to TBI. Sampling occurred 24 h after TBI (48 h after the
  last dose of study treatment; Day 1). (A) Gene expression in vehicle-treated animals
  with TBI was compared to Day 1 of vehicle-treated animals that were not exposed
  to radiation. (B) Gene expression of BIO 300-treated animals exposed to radiation
  was compared to Day 1 of vehicle-treated animals with TBI. Blue bars indicate predicted
  inhibition of the pathway and orange bars indicate predicted activation. The darker
  the shading of the bars, the higher the absolute z-score. The black symbols represent
  the ratio of enriched genes in the data set compared to the total number of genes
  associated with the pathway. Inversely enriched pathways that appeared in the top
  25 list in both the vehicle and BIO 300 group are bolded
