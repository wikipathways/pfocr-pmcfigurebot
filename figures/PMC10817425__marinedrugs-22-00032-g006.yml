figure_title: The possible biosynthetic pathways of tricyclic aglycone glycosides.
caption: The possible biosynthetic pathways of tricyclic aglycone glycosides. Pathway
  (A) the tetracyclic glycosides were converted into the tricyclic glycosides by biosynthetic
  enzymes. Pathway (B) the tricyclic aglycone fridamycin E (2â€²) was generated first,
  followed by sequential glycosylation under catalyzation of GcnG3, GcnG1, and GcnG2.
  Compounds in the dotted line frame were isolated from the mutants fermented in modified
  RA medium
