caption: The compound-gene targets-signaling pathway network of the eight phytochemicals
  related to neuroinflammation. Orange nodes represent each phytochemical candidate,
  blue nodes refer to potential phytochemical's targets in neuroinflammation, and
  the green nodes display the signaling pathway. The size of each node represents
  its degree in the network. The grey connecting lines reflect that each node is interconnected
