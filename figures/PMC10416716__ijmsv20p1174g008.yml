  trophoblast cells.
caption: The functions of decidual stromal cells and their interactions with trophoblast
  cells. (A) Heatmap of the top 40 DEGs in dS cells from NC and RM groups. (B-C) GO
  and KEGG enrichment for the DEGs in dS cells from NC and RM groups, including the
  top 20 KEGG pathways (B) and the top 10 GO terms (BP, CC, MF) (C). (D) Violin plot
  showing the expression patterns of signaling genes involved in the TENASCIN signaling
  network. Normalized expression levels are shown in the violin plot. Red represents
  the NC group and blue represents the RM group. (E) Circle plot showing the TENASCIN
  signaling pathway network in cells from maternal-fetal interface in NC and RM groups.
  The thicker the line represented, the stronger the interaction weights/strength
  between the two cell types. (F) Comparison of the contributions of ligand-receptor
  pairs in the TENASCIN signaling pathway network between NC and RM groups. (G) Violin
  plot showing the expression patterns of signaling genes involved in the CHEMERI
  signaling pathway network. Normalized expression levels are shown in the violin
  plot. Red represents the NC group and blue represents the RM group. (H) Circle plot
  showing the CHEMERIN signaling pathway network in cells from maternal-fetal interface
  in NC and RM groups. The thicker the line represented, the stronger the interaction
  weights/strength between the two cell types. (I) Comparison of the contributions
  of ligand-receptor pairs in the CHEMERI signaling pathway network between NC and
  RM groups. (J) Dot plot exhibited incoming communication patterns of dS cells with
  trophoblast cells
