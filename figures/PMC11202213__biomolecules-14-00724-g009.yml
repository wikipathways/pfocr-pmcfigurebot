caption: Schematic presentation of transcriptional regulation of MATE by GmMYB183
  transcription factor. In response to Al stress, Al3+ interacts with a receptor (ALR1)
  on the plasma membrane to initiate a signaling pathway. Al signal phosphorylates
  GmMYB183 through an unknown pathway. Furthermore, the ALR1-BAK1 complex inhibits
  F-box protein (RAE1) activity, thereby preventing the degradation of STOP1. Both
  STOP1 and GmMYB183 activate the expression of the MATE gene, promoting the secretion
  of citrate and chelating Al ions
