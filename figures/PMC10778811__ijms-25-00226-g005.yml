figure_title: NF-κB pathway activated by TRIF-mediated TLR3 signaling.
caption: 'NF-κB pathway activated by TRIF-mediated TLR3 signaling. (A) BEAS-2B cells
  were stimulated with 10 μg/mL poly(I:C) to evaluate TRIF expression and NF-κB p65
  phosphorylation. (B) Relative TRIF, phosphorylated NF-κB p65 (p-NF-κB p65), NF-κB
  p65 and p-NF-κB p65/NF-κB p65 protein expressions were assessed according to the
  indicated time point, and were normalized to the GAPDH reference protein. Data are
  the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments, and the results
  normalized to untreated control cells. Statistical analysis was performed using
  Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. untreated control cells. (C) BEAS-2B
  cells were pre-treated with 1 μg/mL of TLR3 siRNA and stimulated with 10 μg/mL of
  poly(I:C) for 6 h. TLR3 and TRIF protein levels detected via Western blot. (D) NF-κB
  signaling molecule expression was evaluated in 1 μg/mL TRIF siRNA-transfected BEAS-2B
  cells using Western blot analysis. The cells were stimulated with 10 μg/mL of poly(I:C)
  for 6 h with or without TRIF gene silencing. (E) Relative TRIF, phosphorylated IκB-α
  (p-IκB-α), IκB-α and p-IκB-α/IκB-α protein expressions were assessed and normalized
  to GAPDH. Data are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, and the results
  normalized to untreated control cells. Statistical analysis was performed using
  Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. untreated control cells; # p < 0.01
  vs. poly(I:C)-treated cells'
