caption: 'Schematic diagram: ICP4 triggers Rap1b-CDC42-RAC1-Cofilin cascade signaling
  for membrane remodeling during HSV-1 infection. Viral entry starts with membrane
  invagination mediated by membrane receptors. In the cytoplasm, the viral genome,
  with the lipid capsule and capsid removed, was transported and released into the
  nucleus for genomic transcription and translation, especially the IE genes. Among
  them, ICP4 products may affect other IE gene functions supernumerary of PKA activation
  inhibitors, resulting in the overactivation of Rap1b and CDC42-RAC1-Cofilin cascade
  signaling pathways, the frequent remodeling of the cell membrane, which is beneficial
  for all membrane-associated processes during HSV-1 infection, including entry, intracellular
  transport and release (budding), etc., and finally, may provide a favorable microenvironment
  for efficient viral infection'
