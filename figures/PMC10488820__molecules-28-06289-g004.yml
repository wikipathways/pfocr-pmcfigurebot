figure_title: Sample C and Neviotin A caused transcriptomic changes in MCF-7 cells.
caption: Sample C and Neviotin A caused transcriptomic changes in MCF-7 cells. qPCR
  array of human apoptosis signaling pathway genes in MCF-7 cells exposed to (A) sample
  C (25 μg/mL) and (B) Neviotin A (25 μg/mL) for 24 h. (a,c) Heat maps of all genes
  analyzed in MCF-7 cells exposed to sample C and Neviotin A. Red boxes are upregulated
  genes, and green boxes are downregulated genes. Expression of some genes was not
  detected in the analysis, shown as gray square boxes in the heat maps. (b,d) Scatterplots
  depicting the upregulation and downregulation of genes at the threshold value of
  >1.2-fold after exposure with sample C and Neviotin A. The list of genes upregulated
  and downregulated in the above analysis is listed in Supplementary Table S2
