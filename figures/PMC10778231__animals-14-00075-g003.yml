caption: Significantly different KEGG pathways during the breeding cycle in the crop
  of male and female pigeons. (A) PPAR signaling pathway, (B) TH1 and TH2 cell differentiation
  pathway, and (C) ferroptosis were differentially expressed in the crop of parental
  pigeons, while (Dâ€“F) were their corresponding differential gene expression heatmaps,
  respectively
