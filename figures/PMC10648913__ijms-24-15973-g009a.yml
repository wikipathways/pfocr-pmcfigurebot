figure_title: (a) The results for the correlation analyses between gelsenicine and
  15 upstream biosynthetic pathway genes under SA treatment; (b) the results for the
  correlation analyses between gelsenicine and 15 upstream biosynthetic pathway genes
  under MeJA treatment; (c) the results for the correlation analyses between gelsenicine
  and 15 upstream biosynthetic pathway genes under ETH treatment; (d) the results
  for the correlation analyses between gelsenicine and 15 upstream biosynthetic pathway
  genes under ABA treatment.
caption: (a) The results for the correlation analyses between gelsenicine and 15 upstream
  biosynthetic pathway genes under SA treatment; (b) the results for the correlation
  analyses between gelsenicine and 15 upstream biosynthetic pathway genes under MeJA
  treatment; (c) the results for the correlation analyses between gelsenicine and
  15 upstream biosynthetic pathway genes under ETH treatment; (d) the results for
  the correlation analyses between gelsenicine and 15 upstream biosynthetic pathway
  genes under ABA treatment. Thick lines (weak correlation), thin lines (strong correlation),
  red and rightward slash (positive correlation), blue and leftward slash (negative
  correlation), only the more relevance cases are shown with asterisks [43]. The darker
  the colors, the more asterisks, the stronger is the correlation. The (*) indicates
  p < 0.05, and the (**) indicates p < 0.01. The (***) indicates p < 0.001
