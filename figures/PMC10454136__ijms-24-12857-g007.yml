figure_title: Differential metabolite enrichment.
caption: Differential metabolite enrichment. (A) KEGG classification map of DEGs.
  The ordinate represents the name of the KEGG metabolic pathway, and the abscissa
  represents the number of genes annotated to the pathway and their proportions. The
  colors of the columns represent the q-values of the hypergeometric test. (B) Heatmap
  of phytohormones. The abscissa represents each sample, the ordinate represents the
  quantitative value of metabolites standardized by Z-score after hierarchical clustering.
  The color bar above the heatmap distinguishes different groups
