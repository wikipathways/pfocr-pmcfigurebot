caption: Metabolic analysis of GICs and GSCs cultured under glucose starvation conditions
  for 0, 3, and 6 h. (A,B) Metabolites of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) were analyzed in AsPC-1 and PC-3 cells by targeted LC-MS/MS.
  Metabolite levels were normalized using the BCA protein assay (n = 3). Glucose (-),
  glucose deprivation; graph bars represent the mean Â± sd. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01;
  ***, p < 0.001; n.s., not significant
