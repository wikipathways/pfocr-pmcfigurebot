caption: Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) deficiency affected hepatic glucose
  metabolism under standard diet-fed condition. (A) Western blot of insulin signal
  pathway in the liver from chow-fed mice. Representative images of the band and the
  grey intensity of each band were shown. (B) liver glycogen content. (C) The relative
  mRNA expression levels of glycogen synthase 2 (Gys2), glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl),
  and glucokinase (Gck) in liver tissues. (D) The relative mRNA expression levels
  of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) and glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic
  subunit (G6pc) in liver tissues. (E) Western blot of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)
  and PEPCK1 in liver tissues. Representative images of the band and the grey intensity
  of each band relative to β-actin were shown (n=4). All data are shown as the mean±standard
  deviation. AKT, protein kinase B; WT, wild type; pInsRβ, phosphorylation of insulin
  receptor β. aP<0.05, bP<0.01, cP<0.001, as compared to the indicated WT by one-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA)
