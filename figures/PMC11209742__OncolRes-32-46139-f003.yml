figure_title: 'PAL activates the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in breast cancer. (A)
  Western blotting analysis of p-RAF, RAF, p-MEK, MEK, p-ERK, and ERK from the protein
  lysate of PAL-treated MCF7 cells. (B–D) Bar charts displaying the ratios of p-RAF/RAF,
  p-MEK/MEK, p-ERK/ERK in MCF7 cells. (E) Western blotting analysis of p-RAF, RAF,
  p-MEK, MEK, p-ERK, and ERK from the protein lysate of tumor tissue extracted from
  nude mice treated with either vehicle or PAL. (F–H) Bar charts showing the ratios
  of p-RAF/RAF, p-MEK/MEK, and p-ERK/ERK in tumor tissue. (I) Representative immunohistochemical
  analysis images of p-RAF, p-MEK, and p-ERK in sections of tumor tissue. Magnification:
  40×. Scale bar: 50 μm. (J) Bar charts indicating the percentage of cells positive
  for p-RAF, p-MEK, and p-ERK expression. Bar. S.D., *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <
  0.001. Full unedited gel/blots are provided in Suppl. Fig. S3, where the protein
  molecular weight markers were labeled'
