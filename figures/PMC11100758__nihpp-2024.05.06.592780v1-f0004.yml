figure_title: Inhibiting triglyceride lipolysis suppresses ferroptosis in lipid-starved
  cancer cells
caption: 'A, Schematic illustrating the TG lipolysis pathway and lipase inhibitors.
  TG, triglyceride; DG, diglyceride; MG, monoglyceride; FA, fatty acid; ATGL, adipose
  triaglyceride lipase; HSL, hormone sensitive lipase; MGL, monoglyceride lipase.
  B, Relative ATGL gene expression in the indicated cells cultured in lipid-depleted
  versus lipid-replete media for 24 h. C, Immunoblot for ATGL and β-actin in the indicated
  cells cultured in lipid-depleted versus lipid-replete media for 24 h. D-F, Cell
  death of A549 (D), HeLa (E), and Panc1 (F) cells treated with 1 μM RSL3 for 24 h
  after initial pre-treatment of cells in lipid-depleted versus lipid-replete media,
  with or without 10 μM Atglistatin, for 24 h. G-I, Cell death of A549 (G), HeLa (H),
  and Panc1 (I) cells treated with 1 μM RSL3 for 24 h after initial pre-treatment
  of cells in lipid-depleted versus lipid-replete media, with or without 5 μM CAY10499,
  for 24 h. J, K, Cells were pulse labeled with [U-13C]-18:2(n-6), followed by a chase
  period prior to lipid extraction and analysis, as shown in Fig. 3A. Relative levels
  of [M+18] labeled PUFAs in the non-polar (J) or polar (K) lipid fractions from A549
  cells post-pulse and after the chase period into lipid-replete media or lipid-depleted
  media, with or without 10 μM Atglistatin or 5 μM CAY10499. L, Immunoblot for ATGL
  and vinculin in A549 cells in which ATGL was knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 with two
  independent sgRNAs. M, N, Cell death of A549 sgNTC cells versus sgATGL #5.1 (M)
  or sgATGL #3.1 (N) cells treated with the indicated concentrations of RSL3 for 24
  h after initial pre-treatment of cells in lipid-depleted media for 24 h. O, Cell
  death of A549 sgNTC versus sgATGL #3.1 cells treated with the indicated concentrations
  of RSL3 for 24 h after initial pre-treatment of cells in lipid-depleted media containing
  bovine serum albumin (BSA) control or 25 μM BSA-conjugated 18:2(n-6) for 24 h. Data
  are presented as mean ± s.e.m; n = 3 biologically independent replicates. Comparisons
  were made using two-way ANOVA (D-K, M-O). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001'
