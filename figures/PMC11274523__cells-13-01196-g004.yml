figure_title: Phoenix dactylifera activates insulin signaling pathway genes and transcriptional
  factors and improves pancreatic islet morphology in DCM.
caption: 'Phoenix dactylifera activates insulin signaling pathway genes and transcriptional
  factors and improves pancreatic islet morphology in DCM. Gene expression of (A)
  INS-I, (B) INS-II, (C) PDX-1, (D) MAFA, and (E) GLUT-2 in the pancreas of the healthy
  control and DCM control rats treated with or without PD or metformin, by RT-qPCR,
  with normalization to β-actin as housekeeping control. Data are mean ± SEM, N =
  4. **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05. (F) Representative H&E-stained
  histopathology sections (40× magnification) showing normal histological features
  islets of Langerhans, with scattered β cells (yellow arrows) and red blood cells
  (red arrows) visible in the vicinity (EX: exocrine pancreas) in healthy rat pancreases,
  which were disrupted in the DCM rat pancreases (deformed boundary and selective
  β-cell destruction) and restored by PD or metformin treatment. Scale bar = 20 µm'
