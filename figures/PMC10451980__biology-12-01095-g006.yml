figure_title: Kdm4d regulates the antioxidant capacity of goat fibroblast cells.
caption: Kdm4d regulates the antioxidant capacity of goat fibroblast cells. (A) GSEA
  analysis enriched the oxidative phosphorylation pathway; (B) the expression of genes
  associated with oxidative phosphorylation in Kdm4d knocked-down goat fibroblast
  cells; (C) mitochondrial membrane potential changes in Kdm4d knocked-down goat fibroblast
  cells using JC-1; (D) real-time reactive oxygen levels in goat fibroblast cells
  after Kdm4d knockdown; (E) the expression of genes associated with antioxidation
  in Kdm4d knocked-down goat fibroblast cells; and (F) the expression of antioxidant-related
  proteins in Kdm4d knocked-down goat fibroblast cells. ns denotes a non-significant
  difference, * denotes a significant difference at p < 0.05, ** denotes a significant
  difference at p < 0.01, *** denotes a significant difference at p < 0.001
