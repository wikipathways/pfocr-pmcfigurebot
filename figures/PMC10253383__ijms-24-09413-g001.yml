figure_title: Mechanism of action of OPN.
caption: Mechanism of action of OPN. a—OPN; b—integrin; c—CD44 antigen; d—focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK); e—nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB); f—extracellular matrix; g—intracellular
  matrix; h—cell membrane. This figure describes the mechanisms by which OPN binds
  to two molecules, integrin (b) and CD44 (c). OPN (a) binding to integrin (b) causes
  activation of FAK (d), resulting in cell migration. This process also results in
  the activation of the FAK/Rac1/cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42)-GTPase pathway,
  which facilitates migration. OPN (a) after binding to CD44 (c) activates the NF-κB
  pathway (e). Activation of the NF-κB pathway is preceded by activation of the phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) signalling pathway and phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitor (IκB). These
  processes result in the activation of the NF-κB pathway
