caption: The signaling pathway of insulin action and the selective impairment of insulin
  receptor substrate (IRS)-protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway in insulin resistance.
  (A) It shows that insulin binding to the insulin receptor α subunit on the target
  cell surface activates the receptor subunit tyrosine kinase, leading to the autophosphorylation
  and phosphorylation of the IRS1/2, which activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt pathway and the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
  (B) It shows that in insulin-resistant state, PI3K/Akt signaling is impaired, but
  the MAPK pathway is preserved, which may lead to a mitogenic-promoting effect of
  insulin in endothelial cells involved in vascular injury. GDP, guanosine 5´-diphosphate;
