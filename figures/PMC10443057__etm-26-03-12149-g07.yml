caption: FOXP1 inhibits the MAP3K5 pathway by regulating the expression of DUSP12,
  thereby reducing ox-LDL-induced inflammation and oxidative stress injury in HUVECs.
  Western blotting was used to measure the expression of proteins related to the MAP3K5
  signaling pathway downstream of DUSP12. ***P#x003C;0.001. FOXP1, Forkhead box P1;
  DUSP12, dual specificity phosphatase 12; ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein;
  HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; p, phosphorylated; si, short interfering;
  Oe, overexpression; NC, negative control

  and oxidative stress injury induced by ox‑LDL via MAP3K5 signaling pathway
