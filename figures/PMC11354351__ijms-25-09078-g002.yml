caption: 'The upregulation of the RA signaling pathway in the zebrafish retina immediately
  after optic nerve lesions (ONLs): (a) RARαa, (b) RALDH2, and (c) purpurin were upregulated
  in the retina within 0.25–1 h, while (d) CYP26a1 was downregulated 3 h after the
  ONLs. The experiments were repeated 6–7 times. Statistical analysis was performed
  using one-way ANOVA, followed by Scheffe’s multiple-comparison test. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SEM, with statistical significance set at * p < 0.05'
