figure_title: HFD induced obesity results in sex-specific phenotypic, phosphoproteomic,
  and metabolic changes
caption: '(A) Schematic of in vivo experiment in C57BL6/J mice fed high fat diet (HFD,
  60% kcal from fat, N=19) or normal chow diet (NCD, 30% kcal from fat, N=19) for
  16 weeks, and dry pulverized livers were collected for multiomic analysis of steady
  state polar metabolites and pY phosphoproteome. (B-E) Physiological measurements
  of total body mass (g), fat mass (g), fasted blood glucose (FBG, mg/dL), and blood
  insulin (pg/mL) levels. Data points represent individual animals. Two-way ANOVA
  with multiple comparison (Kruskal-Wallis test) was performed comparing corresponding
  NCD with HFD groups and statistical significance was assigned as follows: * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.001, ns = not statistically significant. (F) 688 Heatmap
  of spearman correlation analysis of polar metabolomics data with hierarchical clustering.
  KDE plot for the distribution of metabolite fold changes represented as Log2(HFD/NCD)
  demonstrating decreased metabolites in males evidenced by left-shift in the distribution.
  (G) Scatter plot of PCA on polar metabolite measurements, data points represent
  individual animals. (H) Scatter plot of metabolites that drive PCA clustering (loadings)
  along PC2 and PC3 color-coded by pathway. Data points represent individual metabolites.
  (I) Heatmap representation of metabolites differentially regulated by diet and sex
  in PC2 and PC3. (J) heatmap representation of spearman correlation analysis and
  hierarchical clustering of targeted pY phosphoproteomics analysis on metabolic enzymes
  in response to HFD. KDE plot showing distribution of pY site Log2(HFD/NCD) demonstrating
  an increase (right-shift) in males but not females. (K) Scatter plot representation
  of PCA on pY sites along PC1, PC2 and PC3. Data points represent individual animals.
  (L) Loadings scatter plot of pY sites that drive clustering across PC2 and PC3,
  color coded according to metabolic pathway of each enzyme. Data points represent
  pY sites. (M) Mean intensity of pY site drivers of PC2 and PC3 clustering represented
  as heatmap across sex and diet'
