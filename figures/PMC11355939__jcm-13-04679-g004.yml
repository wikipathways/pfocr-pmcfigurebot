figure_title: Molecular mechanisms of manganese (Mn) metabolism.
caption: Molecular mechanisms of manganese (Mn) metabolism. The molecular pathways
  involved in Mn metabolism highlight its absorption, transport, and accumulation
  in the body. Mn ions (Mn2+) are absorbed in the intestines through the divalent
  metal transporter 1 (DMT1). After absorption, Mn2+ ions enter the bloodstream and
  are transported in a complex with proteins. The liver, considered the central organ
  in Mn metabolism, plays a crucial role in processing and regulating Mn levels. Mn
  is then distributed from the liver to various tissues throughout the body, with
  a significant accumulation in the bones. This high accumulation in bones underscores
  the essential role of Mn in skeletal health
