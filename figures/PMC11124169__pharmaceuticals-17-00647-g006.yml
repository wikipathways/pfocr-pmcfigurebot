caption: DZ and EQ effect on NLRP3 canonical signaling pathway in murine peritoneal
  macrophages. (A) Densitometry analysis of NLRP3 protein expression. C represents
  untreated control cells. (B) IL-1β secretion was determined by the ELISA method.
  (C) IL-18 densitometry analysis. C represents untreated control cells. Data are
  reported as means ± SEM for three independent experiments as a minimum. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 significantly different from LPS treated control cells
