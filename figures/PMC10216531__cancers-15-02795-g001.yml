caption: Summary of the fundamental parts of TLR4 signaling. The TLR4 signaling pathway
  involves several key molecules including adaptor proteins (TIRAP and TRAM), kinases
  (PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and IKK), and transcription factors (AP-1, NF-kB, and IRF3). These
  molecules work together to activate the downstream signaling transduction and regulate
  the expression of target genes. Created with Biorender.com
