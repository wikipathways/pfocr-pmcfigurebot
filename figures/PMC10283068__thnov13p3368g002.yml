caption: 'The signaling pathway by which SF/HAP/GPM scaffolds promote osteogenesis.
  (A) Immunofluorescence staining of ATF4 in MC3T3-E1 cells on SF, SF/HAP and SF/HAP/GPM
  scaffolds. Scale bars: 20 Î¼m. (B) The expression levels of ATF4, p-Akt, Akt, p-ERK1/2,
  ERK1/2, RUNX2 and OCN in MC3T3-E1 cells incubated on SF, SF/HAP and SF/HAP/GPM scaffolds
  for 14 days. (C and D) The expression levels of RUNX2 and OCN on SF, SF/HAP and
  SF/HAP/GPM scaffolds were evaluated by qRT-PCR'
