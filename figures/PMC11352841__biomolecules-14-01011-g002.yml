  prevent inflammatory changes and mastitis.
caption: Mechanism of bioactive compounds targeting NF-κB signaling pathway to prevent
  inflammatory changes and mastitis. Bioactive compounds inhibit IKK, thereby preventing
  phosphorylation of IκBα. Furthermore, IκBα super-repressor specifically prevent
  NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 and other members from entering the nucleus
