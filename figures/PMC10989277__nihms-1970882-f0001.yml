  lines with high expression of ISGs
caption: '(A) Correlation and statistical significance of genome-wide genetic dependencies
  compared to ADAR1 genetic dependency based on CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene essentiality
  screens. Each dot represents a different gene. Pearson correlations and corresponding
  adjusted p (padj) values were computed for each feature in the Cancer Dependency
  Map Public 22Q4 dataset using all cancer cell lines.(B) Correlation of ADAR1 and
  XRN1 genetic dependency based on CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene essentiality screens.
  CHRONOS23 is a computational method that predicts the sensitivity of cell lines
  to deletion of specific genes using data from gene essentiality screens. Lower CHRONOS
  scores predict for cell lines that are relatively sensitive to gene deletion, while
  higher scores predict for cell lines that are relatively insensitive to gene deletion.
  Each dot represents a different human cancer cell line. Pearson correlations were
  computed for each feature in the Cancer Dependency Map Public 22Q4 dataset using
  all cancer cell lines.(C) Top genetic dependencies correlated with XRN1 genetic
  dependency in CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene essentiality screens. Pearson correlations
  were computed for each feature in the Cancer Dependency Map Public 22Q4 dataset
  using all cancer cell lines.(D) Expression gene set correlations with XRN1 genetic
  dependency based on CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene essentiality screens. Pearson correlations
  and corresponding padj values were computed for each feature in the Cancer Dependency
  Map Public 22Q4 dataset using all cancer cell lines. A subset of the 200 genes with
  the highest absolute correlation was used to calculate gene set over-representation.
  C2 Canonical Pathways v7.0 and Hallmark v7.1 gene set collections from MSigDB were
  analyzed. p values were computed using a hypergeometric test and then corrected
  for multiple hypothesis testing using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction
  to generate padj values. This analysis was generated from RNA-sequencing data from
  unmodified parental cancer cell lines.(E) Lung cancer cell viability was assessed
  by ATP bioluminescence 12 days after targeting control loci (sg1: AAVS1; sg2: Chr2.2)
  or XRN1 (sg1: exon 6; sg2: exon 19) with CRISPR-Cas9. Each dot represents the average
  of three technical replicates from one of three independent biological replicates.(F)
  Cell viability was assessed by ATP bioluminescence 12 days after targeting control
  loci or XRN1 with CRISPR-Cas9 in cancer cell lines of diverse lineages. Each dot
  represents the average of three technical replicates from one of three independent
  biological replicates.(G) Cell viability was assessed by ATP bioluminescence (top)
  or crystal violet staining (bottom) 12 or 17 days, respectively, after targeting
  of a control locus or endogenous XRN1, by XRN1 sg1, with CRISPR-Cas9 in HCC366 cells
  expressing GFP control or overexpressing WT XRN1 resistant to XRN1 sg1 targeting
  or catalytically inactive mutants of XRN1 (D208A and E176G) resistant to XRN1 sg1
  targeting. Each dot represents the average of three technical replicates from one
  of three independent biological replicates.Raw data from gene essentiality screens
  in (A)–(D) were obtained from the Cancer Dependency Map.21 ATP bioluminescence values
  were normalized to the control sg1 sample within each cell line. Data from three
  independent biological replicates are shown in (E)–(G). Error bars represent standard
  deviation from the mean. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ns = not significant,
  as calculated by repeated measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in (E) and
  (F) or paired Student’s t test in (G). See also Figure S1 and Table S1'
