caption: Overview of the effect of CP on cell signalling pathway activity, interactions
  between pathways, and cell fate decisions. The black cross indicates degradation
  of Akt. Black and red arrows indicate the direction of activation, being (↑) upregulated
  and (↑↑) prolonged or excessive upregulation
