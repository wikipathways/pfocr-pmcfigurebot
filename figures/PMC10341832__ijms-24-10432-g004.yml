  protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway.
caption: C-X-C motif chemokine 3 (CXCL3) activates the extracellular signal-regulated
  protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. (A) Protein expression levels
  of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases in BV2 cells in response to CXCL3 treatment
  (10 ng/mL) (western blot). p-ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2. (B) Inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS) and cluster of differentiation (CD) 16 protein expression
  in BV2 cells after 2 h of pre-treatment with U0126 (5 μM) and 12 h of treatment
  with CXCL3 (10 ng/mL) (western blot). (C) mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory markers
  (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, NOS2, and cluster
  of differentiation 86 [CD86]) in BV2 cells were pretreated with U0126 (5 μM) for
  2 h then treated with CXCL3 (10 ng/mL) for 6 h (n = 3; quantitative real-time-polymerase
  chain reaction [PCR]). GAPDH was used as an internal control for normalization.
  (D) mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, NOS2, and CD86 in the brains of mice
  were pretreated with U0126 (10 mg/kg; intraperitoneal injection) for 12 h, then
  infected with meningitic E. coli for 5 h (n = 5 per group; real-time PCR). β-actin
  was used as an internal control for normalization. Data were presented as mean ±
  SD from five independent assays. p < 0.05 (*) was considered statistically significant;
  p < 0.01 (**) and p < 0.001 (***) indicated extremely significant differences; ns,
  not significant
