caption: The schematic model of the canonical HH signaling pathway. On the left side,
  when there is a lack of HH ligand, the PTCH receptor inhibits SMO, which turns off
  HH signaling, and GLI is degraded in the proteasome. On the right side, when the
  HH ligand is present, the PTCH receptor stops inhibition of SMO, which allows GLI
  to translocate into the nucleus and turn on HH signaling
