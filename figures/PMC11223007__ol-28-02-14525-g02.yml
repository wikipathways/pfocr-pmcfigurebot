caption: Involvement of ARID1A and altered proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway.
  (A) Wnt signaling pathway information generated using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes (hsa04310). The pathway is illustrated using data from the KEGG database
  (https://www.genome.jp/pathway/hsa04310) (53). Red boxes indicate differentially
  altered proteins. (B) Western blot images for c-Myc, TCF1/TCF7 and cyclin D1, with
  GAPDH as the loading control. (C) Band intensity of proteins relative to GAPDH.
  The bar graph represents the mean Â± standard deviation (n=3 per group). *P<0.05.
  ARID1A, AT-rich interacting domain-containing protein 1A; TCF, T cell factor; O/E,
  overexpression; MW, molecular weight
