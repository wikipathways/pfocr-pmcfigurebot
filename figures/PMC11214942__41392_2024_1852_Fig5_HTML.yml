caption: The cell mechanotransduction pathways induced by hydrogel stiffness. The
  matrix stiffness can be sensed by integrins, triggering signal transduction that
  leads to the specific activation of intracellular pathways including the FAK, Rho
  GTPase, and Hippo pathways. Mechanical stimuli prompt integrin subunits to activate
  FAK, triggering a signaling cascade involving Paxillin, SRC kinase, the PI3K/AKT
  pathway, and the MAPK/ERK pathway. Concurrently, external stress leads to RhoA activation,
  resulting in actin cytoskeleton contraction. Piezo1, an ion channel, responds to
  mechanical stimuli by activating Rac1 of the Rho GTPase family. Changes in stiffness
  also activate the Hippo pathway, centered around a kinase cascade that includes
  MST1/2 and LATS1/2, impacting downstream effectors such as YAP and TAZ. Information
  is collected from published work.,,â€“ Adobe Illustrator was used to generate this
