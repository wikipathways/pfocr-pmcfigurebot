caption: Overview of how stable isotope tracer techniques can be implemented to investigate
  specific pathway metabolic flux (fluxomics). Stable isotope tracers typically require
  intravenous administration, are highly substrate‐specific and are typically applied
  for short‐term metabolomics investigations. Deuterium oxide (2H2O) represents a
  non‐specific isotope label and is useful for longer‐duration interventions due to
  ease of administration (in drinking water) and the more extended labelling period
  required. When a stable isotope label is present, downstream metabolites are subsequently
  labelled with the isotopic label (enrichment), which appears in successive downstream
  metabolites as time series samples are collected (dependent on overall metabolic
  rate).
