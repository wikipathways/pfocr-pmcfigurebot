figure_title: Species differences in bile acid synthesis.
caption: 'Species differences in bile acid synthesis. (A) The classic bile acid synthesis
  pathway: cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) converts cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol
  (7α-HOC). The sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) converts the intermediate 7α-hydroxy-4
  cholesten-3-one (C4) to 7α, 12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, eventually leading
  to synthesis of cholic acid (CA). C4 can also be eventually converted to chenodeoxycholic
  acid (CDCA). The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) catalyses the steroid
  side-chain oxidation of CA and CDCA. The alternative bile acid synthesis pathway:
  CYP27A1 converts cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HOC), which mainly leads
  to the synthesis of CDCA. In mouse liver, CYP2C70 converts CDCA to α-MCA, which
  can be epimerized to β-MCA. In small and large intestine, bacterial bile salt hydrolase
  (BSH) deconjugates bile acids. Bacterial 7-dehydroxylase dehydroxylates CA to produce
  deoxycholic acid (DCA) and CDCA to produce lithocholic acid (LCA). Bacterial enzymes
  also produce secondary bile acids, including ω-muricholic acid (ω-MCA) and ursodeoxycholic
  acid (UDCA). (B–D) Structure of primary and secondary bile acids'
