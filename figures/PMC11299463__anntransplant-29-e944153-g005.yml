caption: Ginkgetin inhibited the inflammatory response of DCD donor livers through
  the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. mRNA expression level in liver of IL-1β (A), IL-10
  (B) and TNF-α (C) were tested by real-time PCR. Data are presented as mean±SD, *
  P<0.05, ** P<0.01, and *** P<0.001. n=5 per group. All statistical analysis were
  performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0.1 software (San Diego, CA, USA)
