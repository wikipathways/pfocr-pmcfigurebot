figure_title: Regulation mechanism diagram of DEGs and differential metabolites (fats
  and amino acids).
caption: 'Regulation mechanism diagram of DEGs and differential metabolites (fats
  and amino acids). (a) Amino acid anabolism regulation network diagram. (b) Fatty
  acid anabolism regulation diagram. AA: argininosuccinic acid. The yellow rectangle
  represents the regulatory pathway, the red and blue rectangles denote the upregulated
  and downregulated genes, correspondingly; the yellow and green circles denote the
  upregulated and downregulated metabolites correspondingly, the circle with * represents
  the differential metabolite, and the gray signifies the undetected metabolite'
