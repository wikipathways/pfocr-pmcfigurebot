  the STAT3 signaling pathway.
caption: TLR2 and TLR9 intrabodies inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth via the STAT3
  signaling pathway. Western blot analysis in (A) BxPC-3 and (B) PANC-1 cells stably
  expressing TLR2 and TLR9 intrabodies demonstrated a decrease in STAT3 phosphorylation
  following the expression of TLR2 and TLR9 intrabodies and an increase of cleaved
  Caspase 3. GAPDH served as a loading control. Quantitation of pSTAT3 and cleaved
  Caspase 3 in both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells. (C) Increase in Caspase 8 expression
  in PANC-1 cells stably expressing TLR2 and TLR9 intrabodies. Fold changes are calculated
  with respect to pCMV Myc NCAM1 transfected cells. Data are presented as the mean
  ± SD of n = 3 experiments. F-Actin (red) was used to label the cell body. Scale
  bar = 10 μm. * represents ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, and *** represents p ≤ 0.001
