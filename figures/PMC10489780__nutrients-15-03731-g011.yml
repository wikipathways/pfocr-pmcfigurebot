caption: Western blot analysis of key proteins in NF-κB (A) and MAPK (B) signaling
  pathways, IKK (C), P65 (D), IκB (E), ERK (F), and p-ERK (G). Results are shown as
  means ± SD (n = 3). Bar charts with the same superscript letters indicate that the
  difference is not significant (p > 0.05), while bar charts with different superscript
  letters indicate that the difference is significant (p < 0.05)
