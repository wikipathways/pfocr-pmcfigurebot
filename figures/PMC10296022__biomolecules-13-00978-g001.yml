figure_title: Dexamethasone activated the typical GR signaling pathway in human dermal
  fibroblasts.
caption: Dexamethasone activated the typical GR signaling pathway in human dermal
  fibroblasts. (A,B) Hs68 cells were transfected with the glucocorticoid response
  element firefly luciferase plasmid (pGRE-luc) and Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK).
  At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; CON)
  or various concentrations of dexamethasone (0.01–10 μM). Dual-luciferase assays
  were performed 24 h after treatment. (B) After transfection, Hs68 cells were treated
  with DMSO or dexamethasone (1 μM) and incubated for the indicated time, and dual-luciferase
  assays were performed. (C) Hs68 cells were treated with DMSO or dexamethasone for
  1 and 6 h. Expression levels of phospho-GR (p-GR; S211), total-GR (t-GR), and glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression levels were measured by Western blotting.
  The data are represented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of three
  replicates. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
