caption: MICA+ tumor cells communicated with MMP9+ macrophages via the PROS1-AXL and
  CCL15-CCR1 pathways. (a,b) The interaction net count and interaction weight plot
  of HCC cells. The thicker line indicates the higher number of interactions and the
  stronger weights/strength of interactions between the two cell types. (c) Chord
  diagram showing all the significant interactions (ligand-receptor pairs) between
  MICA+/MICA− tumor cells and MMP9+/MMP9− macrophage. (d) The violin plot showing
  PROS1-AXL/CCL15-CCR1 (ligand-receptor pairs) and some macrophage marker genes expression
  in different cell clusters. (e) PROS1-AXL/CCL15-CCR1 ligand-receptor pairs and some
  major IFN-γ signaling pathway genes inside tumor cells and macrophage. Diamonds
  represent genes that are upregulated in macrophages. Octagons represent genes that
  are upregulated in tumor cells. The triangles represent transcription factors
