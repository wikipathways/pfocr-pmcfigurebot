caption: Flowchart of the study. The datasets GSE193677 and GSE206285 were used as
  training sets to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy individuals
  and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). RRA analysis combined with GSEA was used
  to identify enriched pathways of DEGs. The intersection of DEGs and PANoptosis genes
  resulted in the identification of differential PANoptosis-associated genes (DPEGs).
  CytoHubba and MCODE gene network analysis tools were used to identify hub genes
  of PANoptosis in a UC colon. Immunoinfiltration analysis and correlation analysis
  were conducted to determine the relationship between hub genes and immune cells.
  To validate the importance of hub genes in UC, the expression trends and responsiveness
  to biological agents of hub genes were verified in five external validation sets
  (GSE87466, GSE66407, GSE128682, GSE73661, and GSE92415). Subsequently, key transcription
  factors regulating PANoptosis were predicted, and a CeRNA regulation network of
  PANoptosis was constructed. Finally, the expression of key hub genes and transcription
  factors was validated in a classic UC animal model to support our analysis results
