caption: Several pathways are regulated during defense in S. meliloti. (A) Expression
  profiles of defense-related genes at 6 dpi and 10 dpi in nad1-1 vs. WT. Gradient
  scale represents expression levels, with red showing the highest expression to blue
  with the lowest expression. (B) Boxplot of the main genes related to the plant-pathogen
  interaction pathway. (C) Violin plot showing expression levels of genes involved
  in the TCA cycle pathway. (D,F) Bar plots showing relative expression levels for
  genes in the bacterial secretion system (D), NO, ROS, and NCR pathways (F). (E)
  Bean plot showing expression levels of genes involved in the flagellar assembly.
  “nad1-1 vs. WT” represents comparison of transcription of gene families in nad1-1
  mutant nodules (nad1-1) vs. WT nodules (WT)
