figure_title: The roles of AT1 and AT2 receptors, the MAP kinases, and NF-κB signaling
  pathways in mediating ECFP/Ang II-induced NF-κB, p65 expression in wild-type and
  Agtr1a-/- mPCT cells.
caption: The roles of AT1 and AT2 receptors, the MAP kinases, and NF-κB signaling
  pathways in mediating ECFP/Ang II-induced NF-κB, p65 expression in wild-type and
  Agtr1a-/- mPCT cells. Panel (A) shows that ECFP/Ang II increased NF-κB, p65 expression
  in wild-type mPCT cells, and the response was attenuated by both losartan and PD123319,
  supporting an important role of AT1 and AT2 receptors in mediating ECFP/Ang II-induced
  NF-κB, p65 expression in wild-type mPCT cells. Panel (B) shows that ECFP/Ang II
  alone had no significant effect on NF-κB, p65 expression in Agtr1a-/- mPCT cells,
  but both losartan and PD123319 potentiated this response. Panel (C) shows that in
  wild-type mPCT cells, the effect of ECFP/Ang II on NF-κB, p65 expression was attenuated
  by the MEK1/MEK2 kinase inhibitor U0126, the NF-κB activation inhibitor Ro 106–9920,
  and the MEK inhibitor PD 980659, respectively. However, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor
  SB202196 had no effect on ECFP/Ang II-induced NF-κB, p65 expression in wild-type
  mPCT cells. ** p < 0.01 vs. control WT or Agtr1a-/- mPCT cells. ++ p < 0.01 vs.
  WT mPCT cells transfected with ECFP/Ang II, or Agtr1a-/- mPCT cells transfected
  with ECFP/ANG II
