  cycle
caption: (A–D) Time-course analyses of MD simulations starting in each of the three
  major conformations, showing replicates in different shades. (A) RMSD, calculated
  over all Cα atoms relative to the starting structure. Because some simulations experience
  substantial conformational changes after the first 250 ns (dashed line), we focused
  on this initial range for subsequent analyses. (B–C) Plots of the minimum distance
  between T228 and N275 (B) and T130 and Q378 (C) in the outer vestibule show that
  these interactions are stable in the inward-occluded and inward-open simulations
  but do not form in the outward-open simulations. (D) Likewise, simulations show
  that E176 and R244, located in the inner vestibule on TM5 and TM7, respectively,
  stably interact in the outward-open conformation, but not the occluded or inward-open
  conformations. (E–F) Representative 50% contour maps of water density calculated
  from a simulation starting the occluded conformation. (E) The water bridging T130,
  Q378 and D56 persists throughout most of the simulation, as do (F) the waters coordinated
  by H232 and T130 and H232 and E134, suggesting that all these waters-mediated interactions
  are robust. (G) A water is coordinated by H232 and T130 in 40–60% of frames across
  all simulations. A water is also coordinated by H232 and E134 but less frequently,
  in 2–40% of frames.
