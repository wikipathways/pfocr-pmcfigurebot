figure_title: MCregs restrict T-cell activation through EV-mediated metabolic regulation.
caption: MCregs restrict T-cell activation through EV-mediated metabolic regulation.
  (A) Immunofluorescence showing MCregs and CD4+ T cells in ConA-induced livers. Red
  represents CD11b, which indicates MCregs, and green represents CD4, which indicates
  CD4+ T cells (scale bar = 20 Âµm, n = 5). (B) Induced MCregs were cultured in EV-free
  medium, and cell supernatants were collected after 48 h for EV isolation through
  ultracentrifugation. (C and D) TEM (scale bar = 100 nm) and NTA images of MCreg-derived
  EVs. (E) Evaluation of EV marker protein (Alix, HSP70, TSG01, and Cytc) expression
  levels. (F) CD4+ T cells pretreated with MCreg-EVs for 0.5 h were activated with
  PMA, and T-cell activation was measured by flow cytometry 6 h later. (G) Percentages
  of CD25+, CD69+, and CD154+ activated CD4+ T cells among the untreated group (NA),
  control group (Ctrl), and MCreg-EV-treated group (EV). (H) Types of proteins encoded
  by MCreg-EVs. (I) Protein levels of CD39, CD73, and ADA on MCregs and MCreg-EVs.
  (J) Volcano map showing the differentially abundant metabolites between the EV and
  Ctrl groups. (K) Heatmap illustrating the differentially abundant metabolites between
  the EV and Ctrl groups. (L) Pathway analyses based on the differentially abundant
  metabolites between the two groups. (M) Percentage of CD25+ and CD154+ cells in
  the Ctrl group, EV-only group, EV plus AMP group (EV+AMP), and AMP-only group. (N)
  Percentage of CD25+ and CD154+ cells in the Ctrl group, EV-only group, and EV plus
  CD73 inhibitor group (EV+anti-CD73). (O) Percentage of CD25+ and CD154+ cells in
  the Ctrl group, EV-only group, and EV plus A2AR inhibitor group (EV+antiA2AR). (P)
  AMP is degraded to ADO through CD73+ EVs, activating the A2AR receptor and thereby
  inhibiting CD4+ T-cell activation
