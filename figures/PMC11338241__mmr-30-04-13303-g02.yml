caption: 'Effects of DLE and MC on MAPKs signaling pathway in LPS-stimulated microglia.
  Microglia were pretreated with DLE or MC at indicated concentrations and stimulated
  with LPS for 30 min. Relative expression levels of phosphorylated ERK, JNK and p38
  with their non-phosphorylated counterparts were evaluated by western blot analysis.
  Each bar represents the mean ± SD (n=3). #P<0.05 vs. untreated cells; *P<0.05 vs.
  LPS alone treated cells; ns, no significant difference compared to LPS alone treated
  cells. DLE, Diospyros lotus leaf extract; MC, myricitrin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  p-, phosphorylated'
article_title: Diospyros lotus leaf extract and its main component myricitrin inhibit
  itch‑related IL‑6 and IL‑31 by suppressing microglial inflammation and microglial‑mediated
  astrocyte activation
