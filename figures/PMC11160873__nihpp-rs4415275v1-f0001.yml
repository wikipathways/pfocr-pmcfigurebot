  expressed genes.
caption: Enriched Gene Ontology terms of the most representative differentially expressed
  genes. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the DEGs of strains AB5075 (A) or AMA40
  (B) incubated in the presence or in the absence of human urine. Data were obtaining
  using the Fisherâ€™s test (FDR < 0.05) with the Blast2GO software. C) A. baumannii
  TCA-glyoxylate pathways in response to HU. Reactions and intermediates of the TCA
  and glyoxylate cycle are represented and based on BioCyc and MetaCyc. Green and
  red represents up and down-regulation, respectively. *, Indicates statically significant
  differential expressed genes (DEGs)
