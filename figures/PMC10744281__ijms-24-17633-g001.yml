caption: 'Interconnection of glycolysis with other metabolic pathways. (A) Regulation
  of cellular metabolism by PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and AMPK. (B) Glycolysis pathway.
  Hexokinase 2 (HK) phosphorylates at glucose to obtain glucose-6 phosphate (G6P),
  which is converted to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
  (G6PI). The F6P is converted to fructose-1,6-biphosphate (F1,6BP), subsequently
  the F1,6BP, F1,6BP are cut by aldolase (Aldo) to produce dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  (DHAP), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P). GA3P is transformed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GA3PDH) to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG), which is converted to
  3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) by a phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). 3PG is converted to
  2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) by phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). Next, 2PG is metabolized
  to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by enolase (ENO). PEP forms pyruvate (Pyr) by the action
  of pyruvate kinase (PKM2). Pyr is transformed into Lactate and H+ by Lactate dehydrogenase
  and acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH (PDH). (C) The G6P could be redirected
  to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). (D) DHAP could be redirected to the triacylglycerol
  synthesis. 3PG can be a precursor by ceramide synthesis. (E) Krebs cycle. The TCA
  cycle starts with the combination of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate (OA) to produce
  citrate (CIT). CIT is converted into isocitrate (ICIT), which is transformed at
  α-ketoglutarate (αKG) with the NADH generation, Subsequently, the αKG is converted
  at succinyl-CoA (Su-CoA) producing NADH. Su-CoA is transformed at succinate (SCN)
  with the production of GTP. Next, the SCN is converted at fumarate (FM) and releases
  FADH2. The FM is metabolized to malate (ML), subsequently, the ML is transformed
  to OA and generates NADH. The OA again reacts with Ac-CoA to continue the cycle.
  Citrate obtained from the TCA cycle is released at cytosol and converted to Ac-CoA
  and OA by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). (F) The Ac-CoA is a substrate by de novo the
  fatty acids and cholesterol synthesis. (G) β-Oxidation. The fatty acids produced
  by De novo lipogenesis synthesis can be metabolized by the β-Oxidation pathway.
