caption: Core Analysis of the top 10 enriched canonical pathways involved in overlapping
  molecules between COVID-19 and SNCA. Core Analysis of the overlapping molecules
  associated with COVID-19 and SNCA revealed the NISP (p-value of 1.72 × 10−16) as
  the top enriched signaling pathway followed by the “Role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia
  in the Pathogenesis of Influenza”, also known as cytokine storms (p-value of 2.51
  × 10−14) as shown in the red square
