caption: CCT and Cullin1 regulate the TORC1 pathway in vivo. (A) Heat map showing
  the percent change in P-S6k fluorescence for each genetic manipulation as compared
  to its proper control. See  for representative images. (B) Raptor fluorescence is
  significantly decreased in CCT5 LOF conditions and is not rescued by overexpression
  of Raptor. (C) P-S6k fluorescence levels are significantly decreased in CCT5 LOF
  and are not rescued by overexpression of S6k. (D) Representative images of combined
  TORC1 genetic manipulations. Scale bars = 100 Âµm. (E) Total dendritic length in
  microns for WT and combined TORC1 genetic manipulations. (F) Number of Sholl maximum
  intersections for S6k and Cullin1 individual and combined LOF. In all panels * =
  p < 0.05, ns = not significant; see  for detailed statistics.
