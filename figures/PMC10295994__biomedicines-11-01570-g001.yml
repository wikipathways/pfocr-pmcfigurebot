figure_title: The potential preventive impact of HES and ELT against CBZ-caused alterations
  in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) levels,
  superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, signaling pathway of nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO-1) of all experimental groups.
caption: 'The potential preventive impact of HES and ELT against CBZ-caused alterations
  in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) levels,
  superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, signaling pathway of nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO-1) of all experimental groups. This
  test was repeated two times. Values with different superscript letters are considered
  significantly different (p < 0.05). a: there is a significant difference compared
  with the control at p < 0.05. b, c: there is a significant difference compared with
  the CBZ group at p < 0.05'
