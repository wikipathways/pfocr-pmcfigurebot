figure_title: HCMV infection induces AMPK specific phosphorylation of Raf1.
caption: HCMV infection induces AMPK specific phosphorylation of Raf1. (A) Schematic
  depicting the Raf1 signaling pathway. (B) Western blot analysis of Raf1 over the
  course of infection (120 hours) in the absence and presence of Compound C (CC) in
  MRC5 fibroblasts. GAPDH was used as a loading control and UL26 is a control for
  successful viral infection. (C-F) Quantification of Western blots in (B), where
  zero hours post-infection (hpi) is representative of mock infection, are comparing
  phospho-Raf1 to total Raf1 for (C) P-Raf1-S338, (D) P-Raf1-S259 (top band), and
  (E) P-Raf1-S621, and (F) total Raf1 levels normalized to GAPDFI. (G) Two-dimensional
  (2-D) gel electrophoresis of Raf1 during mock infection and HCMV infection with
  or without CC treatment, MOI = 3.0 at 48 hpi in MRC5 fibroblasts
