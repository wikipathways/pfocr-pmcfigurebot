figure_title: Overexpression of ARAF activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway to affect
  apoptosis.
caption: Overexpression of ARAF activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway to affect
  apoptosis. (A) Changes in p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 protein expression after transfection
  with miR-212-5p inhibitor. (B) Western blotting verified the successful construction
  of pcDNA3.1-ARAF. (C) Changes in p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 protein expression after
  transfection of pcDNA3.1-ARAF in response to the cowshed PM2.5 stimulation. (D)
  Detection of associated proteins after overexpression of ARAF. (E) Detection of
  apoptosis rate after overexpression of ARAF using flow cytometry. (F–H) Mitochondrial
  membrane potential (F), ROS (G), and calcium (H) changes after overexpression of
  ARAF. All groups were analyzed in comparison with control or pcDNA3.1 empty vector
  groups. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and values are shown
  as the mean ± SE of the three measurements. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
