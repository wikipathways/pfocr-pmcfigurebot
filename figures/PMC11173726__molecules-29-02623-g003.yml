  proteins.
caption: MS-based quantitative proteomics identified differentially expressed proteins.
  (a) Workflow of quantitative proteomics analysis. (b,c) Venn diagram (b) and volcanic
  map (c) of proteins identified in A549 cells treated with 8 μM DDP in the presence
  or absence of 1 μM TSA for 48 h. In the volcanic map (c), black points refer to
  proteins with a p-value of > 0.05 (i.e., −lg p < 1.3), while red, blue, and green
  points refer to proteins with a p-value ≤ 0.05 and a log2(FC) (DDP + TSA vs. DDP)
  of ≥ 0.26 (red points), a log2(AR) of <0.26 and >−0.26 (blue points), or a log2(AR)
  of ≤−0.26 (green points). (d) Top 10 upregulated (red) and downregulated (green)
  proteins identified in the cells treated with DDP and TSA compared with those in
  the cells treated with DDP alone. (e) IPA enriched canonical signaling pathways
  with which all differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with |FC| > 1.2 identified
  in A549 cells treated with DDP and TSA, compared with the proteins expressed in
  A549 cells treated with DDP only, are associated. (f) Diagrammatic representation
  of interferon-gamma (INF-γ) signaling pathway. (g) Histogram of the abundance ratio
  of selected DEPs expressed in A549 cells treated with DDP and TSA compared with
  the abundance of the same proteins expressed in the cells treated with DDP only.
  (h,i) Western blotting data showing the changes in the level of CD44 expressed in
  A549 cells treated under different conditions. GAPDH was used as an internal reference
  to calculate the relative abundance of CD44 (n = 3). The data in (g,i) are presented
  as means ± SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and **** p < 0.0001 (Student’s t test)
