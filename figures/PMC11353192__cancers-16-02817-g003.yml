figure_title: Lactate increased the association of RAS and PI3K signaling pathway
  proteins with HCAR1.
caption: Lactate increased the association of RAS and PI3K signaling pathway proteins
  with HCAR1. (A) IP of HCAR1 in MDA-MB-231 cell total protein lysates revealed the
  association of HCAR1 with RAS and PI3K signaling activators that was enhanced by
  lactate stimulation for 24 h (Western blot). (B) Quantification of the signal intensities
  of the protein bands shown in lane-2 and lane-3 of figure panel A. Error bars, mean
  Â± SD of 3 biological repeats. * p < 0.05. (C) Lactate stimulation (10 mM) time-dependently
  increased the expression of HCAR1, HCAR1-associated proteins in the RAS and PI3K
  signaling pathways, which were activated as indicated by ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation,
  and MCT1 and MCT4. (D) HCAR1-associated protein expression and RAS and PI3K pathway
  activation in response to increasing concentrations of lactate stimulation for 6
  h
