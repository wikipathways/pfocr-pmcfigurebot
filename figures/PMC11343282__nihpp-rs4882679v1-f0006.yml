figure_title: Foxl1-dependent telocyte signals are required for epithelial gene expression
caption: (A) UMAP plot of control epithelial cells from E15.5 embryos. The cells partition
  into two major clusters of secretory progenitors (red) and undifferentiated epithelial
  cells (blue).(B) Heatmap of the 255 genes differentially expressed between secretory
  progenitors and undifferentiated epithelial cells. Each row represents a gene, each
  column a cell.(C) Expression of key marker genes in secretory progenitors and undifferentiated
  epithelial cells(D) UMAP plot of control (green) and Foxl1null (orange) epithelial
  cells. Note that only very few Foxl1 null cells cluster with secretory progenitor
  cells.(E) Proportion of secretory progenitors and undifferentiated epithelial cells
  in control and Foxl1 null embryos.(F) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identifies
  critical pathways as Foxl1 dependent. The normalized enrichment scores (NES) were
  2.18 for the ‘response to BMP’, 1.97 for ‘negative regulation of epithelial proliferation’,
  and 1.90 for ‘establishment of planar polarity of embryonic epithelium.(G) Staining
  of the fetal (E15.5) small intestine with an antibody specific to Agr2 (Anterior
  gradient protein 2 homolog), a marker of the secretory lineage, was used to localize
  secretory progenitor cells. In control mice, these cells are distributed throughout
  the gut epithelium, while their number is dramatically reduced in the absence of
  Foxl1.(H) Staining of the fetal (E15.5) small intestine with an antibody specific
  to Muc2 (Mucin 2), a marker of the goblet cell lineage, was used to localize goblet
  cell progenitors. In control mice, these cells are distributed throughout the gut
  epithelium, while their number is dramatically reduced in the absence of Foxl1
