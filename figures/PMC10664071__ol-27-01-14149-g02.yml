figure_title: Screening and survival analysis of the overlapping genes.
caption: Screening and survival analysis of the overlapping genes. (A) Venn diagram
  of genes regulated by regulation of Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and TCGA-DEGs,
  with 8 intersection genes in the middle. (B-G) OS analysis on (B) IL1B, (C) JUN,
  (D) TLR2, (E) TLR4, (F) TLR8 and (G) TREM1 in lung cancer. The black line indicates
  low expression and the gold line indicates high expression. TCGA, The Cancer Genome
  Atlas; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; OS, overall survival; TREM1, triggering
  receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1

  regulating the Tollâ€‘like receptor signaling pathway
