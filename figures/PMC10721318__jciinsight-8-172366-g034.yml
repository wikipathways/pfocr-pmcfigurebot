figure_title: Transcriptomic profiling reveals HER2-low TNBC subgroups
caption: (A) Consensus empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves of
  K = 2–10. (B) Delta area changes with K = 2–10. (C) Consensus values of different
  K values. (D) Consensus clustering matrices of the 207 HER2-low TNBC samples with
  mRNA expression at K = 4. (E) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of primary immunodeficiency,
  T cell receptor signaling pathway, cytokine/cytokine receptor interaction, and NK
  cell–mediated cytotoxicity between C4 and other clusters based on the KEGG data
  set (permutation test). (F) Average stromal and intratumoral TIL scores in the 4
  subgroups (Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). (G)
  Relative abundance of 2 immune-activated cells in 4 subgroups based on CIBERSORT
  (1-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s t test). (H) Heatmap showing the top 2,000 variable
  mRNAs of 207 HER2-low TNBC samples; clinical and molecular features are annotated.
  (I) ssGSEA of 207 HER2-low TNBC samples based on KEGG and GO data sets are shown
  in the heatmap, and the FDRs are shown in the bubble plot. (J) Distribution of HER2-low
  TNBC mRNA subgroups in the FUSCC (top) and TCGA (bottom) data sets (χ2 test). The
  samples of A–I were from HER2-low TNBC based on the FUSCC data set. Statistical
  significance was set at P < 0.05
