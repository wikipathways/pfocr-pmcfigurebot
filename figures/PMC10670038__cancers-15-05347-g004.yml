  plot of differentially expressed proteins. (A): the negative control (DMSO) VS group
  A (CuET); (B): the negative control VS group B (GSK J4); (C): the negative control
  VS group A + B (CuET + GSK J4); (D): group A (CuET) VS group A + B (CuET + GSK J4).
  Red dots in the graph indicate upregulated proteins, and blue dots indicate down-regulated
  proteins. (E–G) GO enrichment bubble plot of upregulated proteins between different
  groups. (E): group A (CuET) compared to the control group. (F): group B (GSK J4)
  compared to the control group. (G): group A + B (CuET + GSK J4) compared to the
  control group. (H) GO enrichment bubble plot of down-regulated proteins between
  group A + B (CuET + GSK J4) compared to group A (CuET). A larger bubble area indicates
  that more genes are involved in the signaling pathway, and a redder bubble color
  indicates a smaller p-value and higher confidence. (I) Heat map of the distribution
  of proteins associated with the UPR pathway. A: group A (CuET); B: group B (GSK
  J4); Con: group C (DMSO); AB: group A + B (CuET + GSK J4). The color intensity of
  the squares indicated the protein expression level, red and blue for high and low
  expression, respectively. (J) Western blot assays detected the effect of different
  treatments (DMSO, 1 μM CuET, 20 μM GSK J4, and 1 μM CuET + 20 μM GSK J4) for 12
  h on the expression of ATF6, p-eIF2α, and p-IRE1 in TE10 cells (n = 3). Original
  images can be found in Figure S3. (K–M) Statistical analysis of the Western blot
  results in (J). (K): ATF6; (L): p-eIF2α; (M): p-IRE1. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01'
