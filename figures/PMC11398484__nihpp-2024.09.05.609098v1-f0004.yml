figure_title: Gastruloid stages and gene modules exhibit varying degrees of RNA-protein
  discordance
caption: (A) Histogram of correlations (rPearson) between protein and RNA expression
  for all genes detected at the transcript and protein level in our samplings of human
  and mouse gastruloid development. Dashed line indicates the mean rPearson across
  all genes. Representative genes with varying extents of correlation are highlighted.
  (B) GO term dotplot highlighting GO-defined biological processes exhibiting high
  RNA-protein correlation (rPearson >= 0.75) or anticorrelation (rPearson <= −0.75).
  (C) Boxplot depicting the distribution of protein-RNA correlation (x-axis) as a
  function of subcellular location (y-axis). Rank plots of median RNA-protein rPearson
  across (D) protein complexes or (E) biochemical pathways. Colors indicate databases
  from which the module sets were curated. (F) Representative examples of RNA-protein
  discordance profiles (for any given gene, mean across replicate is shown) for various
  stages. (G) Boxplot depicting the distributions of RNA-protein discordances (for
  any given gene, mean across replicates is shown) for various mouse stages. (H) Dotplot
  highlighting the biological processes significantly enriched in genes exhibiting
  protein-abundant (circles; discordance >=1) or RNA-abundant (triangles; discordance
  <=−1) RNA-protein discordance. Color scale indicates the p-value adjusted using
  the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and sizes of dots indicate the number of genes
  detected within each term. (I) Median RNA-protein discordances of members of protein
  complexes at each stage of mouse gastruloid development. (J) Comparison of the RNA
  and protein log2-scaled fold-changes between early vs. late mouse gastruloids in
  the Mediator complex (left), intraflagellar transport complex B (middle), and mitochondrial
  Complex I of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Significance testing on RNA
  and protein distributions was performed using a standard t-test
