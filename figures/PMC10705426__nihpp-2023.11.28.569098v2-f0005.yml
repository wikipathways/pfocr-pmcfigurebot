figure_title: Multivariate modeling uncovers pan-cancer gene vulnerabilities associated
  with Oxphos state
caption: (A) The top enriched biochemical pathways (from Reactome Pathway Database)
  associated with gene vulnerability features selected by elastic net regularization
  (FDR ≤ 0.05). Genes with positive and negative elastic net coefficients were used
  to infer vulnerabilities in OxphosHigh and OxphosLow cell lines, respectively. (B)
  Performance of the partial least squares (PLSR) model evaluated by variance in Oxphos
  state scores explained (R2) or predicted based on leave-one-out cross-validation
  (Q2) with increasing number of PLS components. (C) Comparison between Oxphos state
  scores and predicted scores by PLSR for the training set of 296 cell lines (left)
  and independent test set of 32 cell lines (right). Two-sided Pearson’s correlation
  analysis was performed between Oxphos state scores and PLSR predicted scores. (D)
  PLSR scores colored according to their Oxphos state score. (E) The list of pan-cancer
  gene vulnerabilities strongly associated with the OxphosHigh or OxphosLow state.
  For each gene, the median difference between dependency (Δ gene dependency) for
  OxphosHigh and OxphosLow subgroups of cell lines are shown
