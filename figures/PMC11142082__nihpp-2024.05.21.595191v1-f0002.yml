figure_title: Polysaccharide degradation pathway to monosaccharide products
caption: Shown are a) cellulose, b) xylan, c) mannan, d) xyloglucan, and e) chitin.
  Enzymes and their CAZyme IDs are noted above arrows connecting substrates and products.
  MAGs that possess genes for each enzyme are denoted beneath the arrow, where dark
  brown (left), green (center), and pink (right) font represent the piscivorous, herbivorous,
  and invertivorous treatments, respectively
