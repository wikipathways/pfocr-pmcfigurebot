caption: A core regulatory motif responsible for flowering activation by vernalization
  in (A) Arabidopsis and (B) legumes. (A) In Arabidopsis, the FT and SOC1 genes integrate
  regulatory inputs from multiple signaling pathways. In the non-inductive conditions,
  these integrators are repressed by the FLC gene. Cold treatment leads to FLC repression
  and activation of FT and SOC1, which in turn activate the meristem identity genes,
  including AP1 (PIM). This turns on floral transition. FT activates meristem identity
  genes both directly and via SOC1. The scheme is based on the pathway overview from
  the Flor-ID database (http://www.phytosystems.ulg.ac.be/florid/, accessed on 4 December
  2023) and a previously published summary on mechanisms of floral transition in Arabidopsis
  [19,20]. Arrows and T-bars show positive and negative regulatory interactions, respectively.
  Dashed lines correspond to indirect/putative mechanisms. GAs, Gibberellins; CKs,
  cytokinins. (B) In legumes, the mechanisms of vernalization-induced flowering have
  not yet been sufficiently studied. Each legume species has several FT genes, but
  often only one FT gene is involved in the vernalization response. Upon cold treatment,
  the FT gene activates SOC1 genes, which are present in two or three copies of the
  legume genomes. It is largely unknown whether the vernalization signal transduction
  from FT to the AP1 (PIM) is direct or indirect and whether the legume SOC1 genes
  perceive any vernalization signal directly. The blue snowflakes and arrows denote
  the vernalization signaling pathway, whose components are well characterized in
  Arabidopsis but remain unknown in legumes
