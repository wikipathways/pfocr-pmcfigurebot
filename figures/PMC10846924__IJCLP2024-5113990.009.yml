caption: Prediction of the therapeutic targets and agents for high PAN2RS AML patients.
  (a) The correlation between CERES score and PAN2RS was investigated based on AML
  cell lines, and 9 potentially druggable targets for the poor survival AML patients
  were finally identified. (b) The workflow of a comprehensive ex vivo drug sensitivity
  analysis for AML patients with PAN2RS based on existing transcriptomic data and
  corresponding drug sensitivity data from previous literature. (c) Three drugs including
  crenolanib, JNJ-7706621, and INK-128 were identified as the potential therapeutic
  agents for the patients with high PAN2RS. All of them showed lower AUC values in
  the high PAN2RS group compared to the low PAN2RS group and were significantly negatively
  correlated with PAN2RS. (d) GSEA result of the KEGG cell cycle pathway. (e) The
  workflow of the ridge regression analysis for selecting the potential drugs. (f,
  g) Ridge regression analysis identified 8 and 5 drugs with high PAN2RS and poor
  prognosis using the CTRP and PRISM datasets, respectively. (h) The workflow of the
  drug selection based on the XSum score and KS score. (i) Based on the XSum score
  and KS score, clofibrate and alvespimycin were identified as most likely to be clinically
  effective in the treatment of AML patients with high PAN2RS. The two-sided p value
  <0.05 was considered significant for all statistical analyses and shown as ∗p <
  0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001
