caption: 'Regulation profile of key cellular pathways and biological processes by
  N3a in the three lymphoma types: The scheme summarizes N3a-mediated alterations
  in eight core cellular pathways in cHL/NHL cells. Each panel demonstrates the regulation
  profile of a cellular pathway post-N3a-treatment. Venn diagrams are generated as
  in Figure 4. Bar-plot images in the right half of each panel demonstrate the differential
  regulation status of mRNAs/proteins relevant to every cellular pathway, in each
  lymphoma cell line of our study (red: up-regulation; green: down-regulation)'
