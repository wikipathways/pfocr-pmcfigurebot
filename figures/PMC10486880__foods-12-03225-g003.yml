figure_title: Potential mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effect of leeks.
caption: 'Potential mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effect of leeks. Under stressful
  conditions, leek extract offsets the inflammatory response by inhibiting the MAPK
  signaling pathway. MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB: nuclear factor
  kappa-B; STAT-1: signal transducer and activator of transcription 1; PPARγ: peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptors γ; AP-1: activator protein 1; TNF-α: tumor necrosis
  factor alpha; IL-6: interleukin 6; IL-1β: interleukin-1β; iNOS: inducible nitric
  oxide synthase; COX-2: cyclooxygenase 2; NO: nitric oxide'
