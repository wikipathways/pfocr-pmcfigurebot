caption: Diagram of the mechanism of action by which MNPs cause neurotoxicity. MNPs,
  which are derived from the degradation of plastic products, automobile tire wear,
  and industrial product degradation in the environment, can penetrate the blood-brain
  barrier. This penetration induces increases in the levels of miR-152-3p and miR-199a-5p,
  which target DNMT1, leading to neuronal death and apoptosis. Elevated miR-199a-5p
  levels can also target WNT2 and promote the progression of depression through the
  CREB/BDNF signaling pathway
