figure_title: Jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signaling are induced in fc2 under cycling
  light conditions
caption: The impact of singlet oxygen (1O2) on jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and
  signaling was assessed in constant light (24h) and 16h light/8h dark diurnal (cycling)
  light conditions. (a) Schematic illustration of the JA biosynthesis pathway, with
  relative expression (compared to wt in the same light condition) of 11 key JA biosynthesis
  and signaling genes. Expression data is from the DESeq2 analysis of the included
  RNA-seq data set. Error bars in the graph represent standard error (ifcSE) estimated
  by DESeq2 (**, padj < 0.01; ***, padj < 0.001). In chloroplasts, Defective In Anther
  Dehiscence 1 (DAD1) catalyzes the conversion of galactolipids into α-linolenic acid
  (α-LeA), which is converted into 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) by a series of
  enzymes; 13-Lipoxygenase (LOX), Allene Oxide Synthase (AOS), and Allene Oxide Cyclase
  (AOC). Subsequently, OPDA is exported out of the chloroplast via the channel protein
  JASSY. Inside the peroxisome, OPDA is reduced by the OPDA reductase 3 (OPR3) and
  shortened in the carboxylic acid side chain by β-oxidation enzymes (ACX1) into JA.
  In the cytosol, Jasmonate Resistant 1 (JAR1) conjugates isoleucine to JA converting
  it into JA-Ile. Jasmonate Transporter 1 (JAT1) transports JA-Ile into the nucleus.
  In response to stressed conditions, JA-Ile attach with the COI1-SCF (coronatine
  insensitive1- Skp1-Cul1-F-box), to promote ubiquitination and degradation of jasmonic
  acid repressors JAZ and JAV1, thereby activating JA response genes. (b) Graph showing
  JA content (ng/g fresh weight (FW)) measured in whole rosettes from plants grown
  for 19 days constant (24h) light conditions or 17 days in 24h light conditions and
  two days of 16h light/8h dark diurnal (cycling) light conditions. Values are means
  ± SEM (n = 3 biological replicates). Statistical analyses in b were performed using
  one-way ANOVA tests, and the different letters above the bars indicate significant
  differences within data sets determined by Tukey-Kramer post-tests (P ≤ 0.05). Separate
  analyses were performed for the different light treatments, and the significance
  of cycling light treatment is denoted by letters with a prime symbol (ʹ). (c) Heatmap
  showing relative expression of 58 genes from gene ontology term “JA mediated signaling
  pathway” (GO:0009867). The blue and red colors correspond to low and high gene expression,
  respectively
