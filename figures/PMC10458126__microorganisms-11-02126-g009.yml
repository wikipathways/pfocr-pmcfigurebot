figure_title: The effects of BA on PCN033-induced MAPK signaling pathways.
caption: 'The effects of BA on PCN033-induced MAPK signaling pathways. (A,D) The levels
  of phosphorylated ERK (8 h). (B,E) The levels of phosphorylated P38 (8 h). (C,F)
  The levels of phosphorylated JNK (8 h). Western blot results show that the levels
  of phosphorylated ERK, P38, and JNK increased significantly after being infected
  with PCN033 and were inhibited significantly after treatment with BA (## p < 0.01
  vs. control; ### p < 0.001 vs. control; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001)'
