caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism by which miR-552-3p alleviates
  liver fibrosis and inflammation. MiR-552-3p alleviates liver fibrosis and inflammation
  via inactivating hepatic stellate cells. miR-552-3p targets the 3'-UTRs of TGFBR2
  and SMAD3 to inhibit TGF-Î²1/Smad3 pathway and decrease the expression of fibrotic
  genes indirectly, and targets to the 3'-UTRs of multiple fibrotic and inflammatory
  genes to decrease their expression directly, thus suppressing HSC activation and
  proliferation
