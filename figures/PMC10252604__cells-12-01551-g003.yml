figure_title: Collagen VI is a new ligand of GPR126 with activating properties in
  the Gi-signaling pathway.
caption: 'Collagen VI is a new ligand of GPR126 with activating properties in the
  Gi-signaling pathway. (A) Concentration–response curves upon stimulation of wild-type
  GPR126 or vector control with collagen VI are shown as % of unstimulated vector
  control cAMP level (vc: cAMP level: 1.46 ± 0.3 nM = 100%). cAMP accumulation is
  displayed in the presence or absence of 2.5 µM forskolin co-stimulation in COS-7
  cells as means ± SEM of three independent experiments each performed in triplicates.
  (B,C) Pretreatment with PTX abolishes reduction in cAMP through incubation with
  collagen VI (2 µg/mL) in cells stimulated (B) with or (C) without Fsk (2 µM). Of
  note, stimulation with the agonistic peptide pGPR126 (1 mM) shows significant increase
  of cAMP in assay conditions without Fsk co-stimulation (C). Data are shown as fold
  over unstimulated vector control (vc: cAMP level: 4.76 ± 1.45 nM) as means ± SEM
  of four independent experiments each performed in triplicates. Statistics were performed
  using paired t-test; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. (D) COS-7 cells were transfected with
  wild-type, T841A Stachel mutant GPR126 or vector control. Accumulation of IP1 with
  Gqi chimera was measured after treatment of the transfected cells with or without
  collagen VI (2 µg/mL). Data are shown as fold over unstimulated vector control (vc:
  IP1 level: 6.37 ± 3.5 nM) as means ± SEM of three independent experiments each performed
  in triplicates. Statistics were performed using paired t-test; * p < 0.05'
