caption: (A)—Networking of ClueGO significant enrichment pathways analysis from KEEG
  and Reactome (term p-value corrected with Bonferroni step down, p < 0.05), which
  represent the terms enrichment of proteins from HepG2 control cells (red), HepG2
  cells exposed to F. vesiculosus (blue) and terms from both clusters (gray). (B)—Bar
  chart representing the percentage of gene by term of each enriched pathway from
  HepG2 control cells (B) and HepG2 exposed to F. vesiculosus (C). The red asterisk
  indicate that protein/gene can be part of multiple biological processes. The number
  next to * indicates how many additional term occurrences exist in other gene ontology
