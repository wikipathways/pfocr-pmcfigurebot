caption: Schematic of relevant pathways and their targeted inhibitors (in red) for
  the EC. Stimuli trigger VEGFA to bind and autophosphorylate VEGFR2, triggering both
  the PI3k/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/ERK pathways. Patients with HHT have germline mutations
  in the TGFB pathway that result in ALK1 activation by BMP9 and 10 ligands, which
  can trigger the TGFB canonical (SMAD 1/5/8) and non-canonical pathways (PI3K/AKT/mTOR).
  Patients with capillary malformation AVM syndrome harbour germline mutations in
  RASA1 and EPHB4, leading to the KRAS signaling pathway. Patients with sporadic AVMs
  harbour mostly KRAS mutations, alongside BRAF, MAP2K1, and RIT1. Activation of these
  pathways results in the expression of proteins important in angiogenesis, vascular
  migration, and maturity
