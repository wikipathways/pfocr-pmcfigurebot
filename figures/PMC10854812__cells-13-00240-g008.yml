caption: Proposed model for models of both non-receptor tyrosine kinase- (NRTKs) and
  receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways in tumor progression and drug
  resistance. (A) NRTK-mediated signaling pathways to tumor progression and drug resistance.
  NRTK Fyn stimulates Stat3, CD133 signaling to PI3K/AKT/mTOR, PI3K/PDK-1, PI3K/AKT/MDM2,
  and Grb2/Grb7/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways in melanoma by the phosphorylation of tyrosine
  kinase Tyr828 and Tyr852 residues located on the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of
  the CD133 protein to recruit both p85 and Grb2 proteins, respectively. P85 serves
  to mediate Fyn-stimulated CD133 signal to PI3K to enhance the activation of several
  pathways including PI3K/PDK-1/AKT/mTOR/S6K and/or PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K; PI3K/PDK-1/AKT/4E-BP1
  and/or PI3K/AKT/4E-BP1; PI3K/PDK-1/AKT/MDM2 and/or PI3K/AKT/MDM2; PI3K/PDK-1/AKT/MKP-1
  and/or PI3K/1/AKT/MKP-1. Meanwhile, Grb2serves to mediate Fyn-stimulated CD133 signal
  to enhance the activation of NRAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Finally, the biological
  consequences of Fyn-stimulated signal to CD133 in melanoma include the enhancement
  of protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, cell growth, survival, and drug resistance.
  (B) RTK-mediated signaling pathways to tumor progression and drug resistance. By
  binding RTKs to their corresponding receptors, tyrosine kinases (TKs) bind ligands
  to initiate the signaling pathway via intermediate molecule, insulin receptor substrate
  (IRS). Then, the activated PI3K becomes able to phosphorylate the phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a process
  that is reversed by PTEN. Meanwhile, at the cell membrane, proteins with pleckstrin
  homology domains are then phosphorylated via PIP3 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein
  kinase-1 (PDK1) and AKT). Also, PDK1 can phosphorylate critical residues on AKT.
  The tumor suppressor complex of TSC1/TSC2 normally inhibits mTOR activation via
  the brain-enriched Ras homologue (Rheb). Activated AKT prevents this inhibition
  and leads to activation of the mTOR/Raptor complex 1 (mTORC1). This complex can
  be inhibited by rapamycin and its analogues. Consequently, mTORC1 leads to the activation
  of downstream proteins involved in the initiation of protein synthesis, leading
  to cell growth. Also, activation of RTKs able to initiate MAPK pathway signaling,
  leading to tumor progression, proliferation, and drug resistance. Activation of
  the MAPK pathway may also enhance PI3K signaling. MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase
