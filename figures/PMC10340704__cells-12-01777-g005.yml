caption: 'ASIV mitigates EMT and G2/M arrest, promotes ALDH2 expression, inhibits
  autophagy, and activates AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in TGF-β1-stimulated HK-2 cells.
  (a) Protein expressions of fibronectin, vimentin, and α-SMA in HK-2 cells using
  Western blotting. (b) Quantitative analysis of the relative protein expressions
  of fibronectin, vimentin, and α-SMA. (c) Protein expressions of p-p53ser15, p53,
  p21, and p-H3ser10 in HK-2 cells using Western blotting. (d) Quantitative analysis
  of the phosphorylation level of p53 and the relative protein expressions of p21
  and p-H3ser10. (e) Protein expression of ALDH2 in HK-2 cells using Western blotting.
  (f) Quantitative analysis of the relative protein expression of ALDH2. (g) Protein
  expression of p-AKT, t-AKT, p-mTOR, t-mTOR, ATG7, SQSTM1, Beclin1, and LC3 I/II
  in HK-2 cells using Western blotting. (h) Quantitative analysis of the phosphorylation
  levels of AKT and mTOR in HK-2 cells. (i) Quantitative analysis of the relative
  protein expressions of ATG7, SQSTM1, Beclin1, and LC3 II/LC3 I in HK-2 cells. Representative
  images of immunofluorescence staining for (j) fibronectin, (k) F-actin, (l) Ki67
  (red)/p-H3 (green), and (m) LC3 I/II in HK-2 cells. Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM (n = 3, 100 µm scale bar). One-way ANOVA was followed by Dunnett’s multiple
  comparisons test. ### p < 0.001 vs. the control group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 vs. the TGF-β1 group'
