caption: 'Genistein Reduces Lysosome Formation and β-catenin Levels in Colon Cancer
  Cells(A) Genistein reduces multivesicular body formation (MVB) in SW480 cells.(B–B″)
  Untreated (control) SW480 cells have high levels of lysosomes visualized by MVB
  marker CD63 (green) and high levels of nuclear β-catenin (red).(C–C″) Cells with
  identical treatment as (B)-(B″) after the overnight genistein treatment (250 μM).
  Genistein treatment reduces both CD63 and β-catenin and CD63 levels.All experiments
  with cultured cells were repeated in at least 3 biological replicates. Blue: nuclei.
  Scale bar, 10 μm. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
