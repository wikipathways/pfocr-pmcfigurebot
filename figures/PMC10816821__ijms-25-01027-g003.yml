figure_title: Effect of NAR on APP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mice lung
  tissue.
caption: Effect of NAR on APP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mice lung tissue.
  (A) Effect of NAR on the expression of essential proteins in the NLRP3 inflammasome
  signalling pathway in lung tissue after APP infection. (B) Effect of NAR on the
  expression of critical genes in the NLRP3 inflammasome signalling pathway in lungs
  after APP infection. (C) Effect of NAR on the expression of IL-18 and IL-1β proteins
  in lung tissues, shown by ELISA assay. (Different lowercase letters indicate statistically
  significant differences between groups p < 0.05, while the same lowercase letters
  indicate no significant differences between groups p > 0.05)
