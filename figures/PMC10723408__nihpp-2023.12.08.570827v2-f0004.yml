figure_title: Transient de novo fluxes within the sphingolipid pathway network
caption: (A) A metabolic network map used for r-DMFA analysis, and upstream of the
  hydroxy-ceramides (hCer) metabolite junction. This highlights internal reactions
  of the sphingolipid pathway (B) Corresponding transient fluxes from the pathway
  shown in (A). (C) Transient fluxes for processes occurring after the hCer. Overall,
  the flux values, normalized to serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity, depict
  the branching of flux into different sphingolipid products. A predominant channeling
  of long chain bases (LCBs) (~93%) through class II ceramide synthase for the production
  of very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) containing ceramides, particularly with C24
  and t18:0-LCB, is observed
