figure_title: Metabolite changes in mice placed on dietary folate restriction late
  in life
caption: (A) Steady-state serum amino acid levels were measured at 120 weeks of age
  using an HPLC-based assay (see Materials and Methods). The measured amounts (in
  nmol/mL) are on the y-axis. The different diets are on the x-axis for each amino
  acid, as indicated. The boxplots were drawn as in the previous figures. Differences
  in glutamine (Gln) levels in male mice were significant (marked with a red asterisk;
  p=2.6E-05, based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test). (B) Steady-state levels of primary
  and biogenic amine metabolites from liver tissue collected at 120 weeks of age were
  measured by GC-TOF MS and HILIC-QTOF MS/MS, respectively. Changes in the indicated
  pairwise comparisons were identified from the magnitude of the difference (x-axis;
  Log2-fold change) and statistical significance (y-axis; based on robust bootstrap
  ANOVA tests), as indicated by the red lines (see Materials and Methods). (C) Metabolite
  enrichment analysis based on the MetaboAnalyst platform (Chong et al., 2019) for
  male mice from the data in (B), for metabolites present at significantly lower levels
  under folate-limitation (p<0.05 and >1.5-fold change). The corresponding metabolic
  pathways are on the y-axis, and the p values are on the x-axis. The size of each
  bubble on the chart reflects the relative number of ‘hit’ metabolites in each pathway.
  The color of each bubble reflects the enrichment ratio, which is the number of hits
  within a metabolic pathway divided by the expected number of hits. Only pathways
  with enrichment >2 and FDR values <0.05 are shown
