caption: PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related gene alterations involved in the pathogenesis
  of Endometriosis and Endometriosis-Associated Ovarian Cancer. Normal uterine epithelium
  harboring activating mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1, ERBB2, and PIK3R1 and is correlated
  with a higher tendency towards endometriosis development [30,32,33,34], while endometriotic
  epithelium carrying additional activating mutations in PIK3CA and inactivating mutations
  in PTEN and ARID1A is more likely to undergo malignant transformation [35]. Molecules
  depicted in green are components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. ARID1A,
  depicted in purple, does not actively participate in mTOR signaling, but closely
  interacts with it, in such a way that loss of ARID1A expression probably allows
  the function of the mTOR pathway, which is enhanced by the aforementioned genetic
  alterations, to induce carcinogenesis in ovarian endometriotic cysts. PIK3CA, Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha; AKT1, RAC-Alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase;
  ERBB2, Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; PIK3R1, Phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  regulatory subunit 1; PTEN, Phosphatase, and tensin homolog; ARID1A, AT-rich interaction
  domain 1A
