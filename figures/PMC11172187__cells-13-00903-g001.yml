caption: Gliogenic switch during brain development. (A) During early brain development,
  RGCs, depicted in blue, emerge as the predominant cell type. They possess the ability
  to generate neurons (depicted in pink) and astrocytes (depicted in purple) in a
  temporally segregated manner. Moreover, aside from astrocytes and neurons, RGCs
  also generate oligodendrocytes and NG-2 glia, which are not illustrated in this
  image. (B) Intrinsic cell programs during the initiation of the gliogenic switch
  in RGCs are in part controlled by the activation of JAK/STAT by IL-6 family cytokines
  (depicted in red dots) secreted by nascent neurons (depicted in pink) and NOTCH
  ligands (blue dots) activating the NOTCH signaling pathway in RGCs. Additional factors
  implicated in astrogenesis include SOX9, which is closely associated with NFIA activity.
