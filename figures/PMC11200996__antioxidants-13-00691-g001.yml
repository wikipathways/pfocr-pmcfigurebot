caption: Main factors that affect the bioavailability of nitric oxide. The bioavailability
  of nitric oxide (NO) can be influenced by various factors that impact the activity
  of the standard NO synthesis pathway, carried out by nitric oxide synthases (NOSs).
  These factors include reduced levels of its substrate, arginine, or its cofactor
  tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and increased expression of arginase and levels of asymmetric
  dimethylarginine (ADMA), which competes with arginine for interaction with the enzyme
  [31,32,33,34,35]. Drugs that inhibit enzymes with nitrite reductase activity, such
  as xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), can affect NO, as seen with febuxostat and allopurinol,
  which may inhibit nitrite-derived NO formation [36]. Elevated oxidative stress can
  deplete NO due to diffusion-limited NO reaction with superoxide producing peroxynitrite,
  thereby decreasing bioavailable NO levels. Chronic high blood pressure can lead
  to endothelial damage, and subsequently reduce NO production [37]. Similarly, other
  factors that diminish NO bioavailability may compromise physiological vasodilation
  and contribute to hypertension development. Bone morphogenetic protein receptor
  II (BMPRII) plays a role in endothelial cell survival and proliferation; reduced
  expression of this receptor has been linked to the development of endothelial dysfunction
  [31,32,33,34,35]. Factors that impair the enterosalivary nitrate cycle also decrease
  NO bioavailability, including ablation or dysfunction of salivary glands, which
  secrete nitrate into the oral cavity, and genetic disorders affecting the nitrate
  cotransporter in these glands (sialin) [38]. Reduced dietary intake of nitrate or
  nitrite, caused by decreased consumption of vegetables rich in these compounds,
  frequent use of mouthwash that reduces the commensal microbial population with nitrate
  reductase activity, and the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which attenuate
  non-enzymatic nitrite reduction to NO in the stomach, may reduce the NO bioavailability
  [39,40]. These mechanisms may compromise NO-mediated vasodilatory effects, increasing
  peripheral vascular resistance, and promote pro-atherosclerotic mechanisms that
  are associated with cardiovascular diseases. Parts of the figure were drawn using
