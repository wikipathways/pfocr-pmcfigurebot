figure_title: AMPK-ULK1 signaling pathway through the AR-A014418 induces autophagy.
caption: AMPK-ULK1 signaling pathway through the AR-A014418 induces autophagy. Bladder
  cancer cells were treated with 10 µM AR-A014418 at the indicated time (0, 3, 6,
  12, and 24 h). (a) Western blot analysis of phosphorylated ULK1 (p-ULK1), total
  ULK1 (ULK1), and β-actin as a loading control. The original blots are presented
  in Supplementary Figure S4m–p. (b) Relative protein intensity was quantified using
  ImageJ. (c) Western blot analysis of p-ULK1 and ULK1 in siGSK-3β-transfected bladder
  cancer cells. The original blots are presented in Supplementary Figure S4q,r. (d)
  The expression of phosphorylated AMPKα (p-AMPKα) and total AMPKα (AMPKα) proteins
  were determined using Western blot analysis. The original blots are presented in
  Supplementary Figure S4s–v. AMPK-ULK1 signaling pathway through the AR-A014418 induces
  autophagy. (e) Schematic illustration of the induction of autophagy by GSK-3β inhibitor
  through the AMPK-ULK1 signaling pathway
