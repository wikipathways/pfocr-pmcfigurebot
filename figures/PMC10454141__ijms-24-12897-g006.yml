caption: Activation of cytosolic CaMKII in T2D VSMCs mediates Erk1/2 activation. (A)
  Immunoblots for phosphorylated (active) CaMKII and total CaMKII protein in VSMCs
  isolated from NG and T2D mice of the WT and mtCaMKIIN genotypes (n = 5). (B) Representative
  immunoblot (upper panel) and quantification (lower panel) of co-IP between CaMKII
  and c-Raf in VSMCs from diabetic (T2D) mice of the WT and mtCaMKIIN genotypes. IP
  was performed with anti-cRaf and probed with anti-CaMKII (n = 5). (C) Representative
  immunoblots assessing upstream signaling components of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway
  in VSMCs from T2D mice of the WT and mtCaMKIIN genotypes. WT T2D cells were transduced
  with adenovirus expressing untargeted CaMKIIN for 72 h prior to treatment with PDGF
  (n = 3). (D) Number of VSMCs in T2D mice of the WT genotype following transduction
  with adenovirus expressing untargeted CaMKIIN or control virus for 72 h prior to
  treatment with PDGF (20 ng/mL) and counted 72 h later (n = 12). Analyses by Kruskalâ€“Wallis
  test (A,B,D)
