caption: IGJ is involved in the regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  process in breast cancer. (A) Bioinformatics data for predicting signaling pathways
  and biological processes involved in IGJ. (B and C) Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence
  staining were used to further verify the potential mechanism of IGJ affecting the
  biological behavior of breast cancer cells. **P<0.01. IGJ, joining chain of multimeric
  IgA and IgM (JCHAIN)
