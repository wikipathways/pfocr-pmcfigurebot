  cells.
caption: '6-Gingerol induced the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in A549 and H460 cells.
  (A) Cell death analysis via the MTT assay in A549 and H460 cells after treatment
  with increasing concentrations of 6-gingerol for 48 h. *** p < 0.001 (ANOVA test);
  # p < 0.001 vs. control. (B) 6-Gingerol induced nuclear aberrations in NSCLC cells.
  DAPI staining and phase-contrast microscopy images show abnormal nucleus formation
  induced by 48 h treatment with 200 µM 6-gingerol. Representative photographs are
  presented. Scale bar 200 μm. (C) Annexin V-FITC vs. PI staining analysis after incubation
  with 200 μM 6-gingerol for 48 h. (D) Western blotting of BAX, BCL-2, BCL-xL, and
  C-Casp9 proteins. (E) qRT-PCR showing illustrative BAX, BCL-2, and caspase-9 gene
  expression. Next, Cp values were normalized to GAPDH mRNA. Controls were set at
  100. *** p < 0.001 (ANOVA test); # p < 0.001 vs. control. (F) Flow cytometry analysis
  for mitochondrial membrane potential. (G) Plot of ATP concentration after treatment
  with 200 µM 6-gingerol. *** p < 0.001 (Student’s t-test). (H) Western blotting showing
  cytochrome c expression. (I) Western blotting of cytochrome c in cytosolic and mitochondrial
  fractions. GAPDH and COX IV were the controls for cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions,
  respectively'
