caption: KEGG pathway analysis of carnosic acid downregulated proteins associated
  with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. (A,B), Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway and its
  downregulated proteins. The mapping of significantly downregulated proteins onto
  KEGG pathways was performed by ShinyGO software. Downregulated proteins of the pathway
  were labeled blue
