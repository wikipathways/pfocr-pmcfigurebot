caption: S100a9hi macrophages transition to myofibroblasts through the activation
  of the Tgf-β/smad3 signaling pathway. (A) Representative TSNE plots from CyTOF data
  showing colored expression in arbitrary units (AU) of CD11b, F4/80, and α-SMA in
  cardiac macrophage in Sham and MIR group (n = 9). (B) Representative immunofluorescence
  images of S100a9, CD68, and α-SMA co-staining of day 3 and day 7 post injury heart
  tissues. n = 5 in each group. All scale bar, 50 μm. (C-D) Representative immunofluorescence
  images of CD68 and α-SMA co-staining and quantitative analysis in each group. n
  = 5. ns, no significance, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared to WT-MIR, Student's
  t test. All scale bar, 50 μm. (E) Representative immunofluorescence images of p-smad3
  and S100a9 co-staining of day 7 post injury heart tissues. n = 5 in each group.
  All scale bar, 50 μm. (F-G) Western blots of heart Tgf-β, p-smad3, t-smad3, and
  the quantification of expression on day 7 after MIR and Sham group. n = 5 in each
  group. ns, no significance, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared to WT-MIR group, one-way
  ANOVA. (H-I) Representative images of Masson staining of heart sections and quantitative
  analysis in each group. n = 5. ns, no significance, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared
  to MD group, one-way ANOVA. (J-K) Representative immunofluorescence images of CD68
  and α-SMA co-staining and quantitative analysis in each group. n = 5. ns, no significance,
  * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared to MD, one-way ANOVA. All scale bar, 50 μm. (L-M)
  Western blots of α-SMA, p-smad3, t-smad3, and the quantification of expression in
  each group. n = 5 in each group. ns, no significance, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared
  to WT-Tgfβ group, one-way ANOVA
