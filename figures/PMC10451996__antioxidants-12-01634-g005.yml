caption: VDR agonist suppresses endoplasmic reticulum stress, while stable knockdown
  of VDR stimulates endoplasmic reticulum stress through regulation of JAK/STAT3 signaling
  pathway in lung fibroblasts. (A,B) Hallmark analysis of GSEA reveals that the IL6-JAK-STAT3
  signaling pathway is enriched in lung fibroblasts obtained from IPF patients (A)
  and bleomycin-treated mice (B). (C) Mlg cells were treated with saline or bleomycin
  (5 μg/mL) in the presence of vehicle or paricalcitol (2.5 μM) for 48 h. Protein
  levels of phosphorylated JAK1, JAK1, phosphorylated STAT3, and STAT3 were determined
  by Western blot analysis. Representative protein bands were presented on the left
  of the histograms. Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 4). ** p < 0.01 vs. Control,
  && p < 0.01 vs. BLM. (D) Mlg cells were stably transfected with Lv-ShRNA-NC or Lv-ShRNA-VDR.
  Protein levels of phosphorylated JAK1, JAK1, phosphorylated STAT3, and STAT3 were
  determined by Western blot analysis. Representative protein bands are presented
  on the left of the histograms. Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 4). ** p <
  0.01 vs. Lv-ShRNA-NC. (E) Mlg cells were treated with saline or bleomycin (5 μg/mL)
  in the presence of vehicle or STAT3 inhibitor C188-9 (4 μM) for 48 h. Protein levels
  of phosphorylated STAT3, STAT3, Grp78, and CHOP were determined by Western blot
  analysis. Representative protein bands were presented on the left of the histograms.
  Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 4). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. Control,

  or Lv-ShRNA-VDR were treated with vehicle or STAT3 inhibitor C188-9 (4 μM) for 48
  h. Protein levels of phosphorylated STAT3, STAT3, Grp78, and CHOP were determined
