caption: 'miR-552-3p regulates TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway in LX-2 cells. (A) Relative
  mRNA levels of fibrotic genes in miR-552-3p (1 nM) or NC (1 nM)-transfected LX-2
  cells treated with 10 ng/mL TGF-β1 or not for 24 h. (B) Relative mRNA levels of
  inflammatory genes in miR-552-3p (1 nM) or NC (1 nM)-transfected LX-2 cells treated
  with 800 ng/mL LPS or not for 8 h. (C-D) The protein levels of Collagen Ⅰ, p-Smad3,
  t-Smad3 and α-SMA in LX-2 cells transfected with miR-552-3p (1 nM) for 48 h and
  then treated with 10 ng/mL TGF-β1 or not for 24 h. (E) Relative mRNA levels of SMAD3
  and TGFBR2 after the LX-2 cells were transfected with different concentrations of
  miR-552-3p (30, 10, 1, 0.1 nM) for 48 h. (F) MiR-552-3p level in LX-2 cells transfected
  with Anti-miR-552-3p or Anti-NC (50 nM) for 72 h. (G) Relative mRNA levels of SMAD3
  and TGFBR2 after the LX-2 cells were transfected with Anti-miR-552-3p for 72 h.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **
  P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. NC or Anti-NC; #P<0.05, ##P <0.01, ###P <0.001 vs. H2O'
