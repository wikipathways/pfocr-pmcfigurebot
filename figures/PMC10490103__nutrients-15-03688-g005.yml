figure_title: Lifestyle interventions effect on the modulation of miRNAs involved
  in the pathophysiology of AD.
caption: Lifestyle interventions effect on the modulation of miRNAs involved in the
  pathophysiology of AD. In relation to β-amyloid production, the healthy lifestyle
  will promote the non-amyloidogenic pathway, favoring the release of P3 peptide,
  which has neuroprotective effects. In relation to neuroinflammation, activation
  of microglia and astrocytes will be reduced, releasing fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines
  that preserve a healthy state for neurons. In this metabolic pathway, exercise can
  reduce miR-192-5p expression and increase miR-129-5p and miR-130a-3p expression,
  reducing neuroinflammation. In terms of β-amyloid clearance, lifestyle interventions
  can enhance autophagic activity and effectively clear the neuronal β-amyloid burden.
  Furthermore, they can increase phagocytosis of Aβ by microglia into soluble forms
  and promote outward transport of Aβ into the peripheral system at an increased rate
  due to increased expression of LRP1 transporters at the blood–brain barrier
