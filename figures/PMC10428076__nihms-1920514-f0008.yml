figure_title: Deletion of GPR44 worsens AML by activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
caption: (A–D) Expression of genes including PI3K (Pik3ca, Pik3cb, Pik3cd) (A), AKT
  (Akt1, Akt2) (B), PKC (Prkca, Prkcb, Prkcg) (C), and PKA (Prkacg) (D) assessed by
  qPCR analysis in WT or Gpr44−/− AML cells isolated from spleens of 2 AML-recipient
  mice. Data were normalized to WT AML cells and Gapdh expression (n = 8–10 biological
  replicates in each group).(E) Western blot showing the expression of Phospho-PI3K,
  PI3K, Phospho-mTOR, mTOR, Phospho-AKT, AKT, Phospho-P70-S6K, P70-S6K, and β-actin
  in purified 1° WT and Gpr44−/− AML cells.(F) Western blot showing the expression
  of Phospho-PTEN, PTEN, Phospho-4EBP1, 4EBP1, and β-actin in WT or Gpr44−/− AML cells
  isolated from spleens of 2° AML-recipient mice (n = 5 biological replicates in each
  group).(G) Viability of purified 1 Gpr44−/− AML cells treated with 150 μM ARN509,
  10 μM LY294002, 10 nM Wortmannin, 10 nM Sapanisertib, 250 nM Torin1 for 24 h. Data
  were normalized and compared with vehicle treatment.(H and I) Flow cytometric analysis
  of Phospho-P70-S6K (H) and Phospho-4E-BP1 (I) in CD45.1+ 1° Gpr44−/− AML cells treated
  with 10 μM LY294002, 10 nM Wortmannin, 10 nM Sapanisertib, 250 nM Torin1 for 24
  h. MFI was summarized (n = 4).(J) Counts of CFUs of purified 1° Gpr44−/− AML cells
  treated with 10 μM LY294002, 10 nM Sapanisertib, and 2.5 μM LY2584702 in methylcellulose
  medium (2,500 cells/well, n = 3 for technical replicate) CFUs were counted on day
  8.(K) Representative image of colony growth in (J). Scale bar, 100 μm.Data shown
  are mean ± SEM per group; *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
