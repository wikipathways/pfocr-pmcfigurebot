caption: A few of the common screening approaches for bioactive peptides. (a) Illustrative
  representation for bead array to identify peptides based on a protein-bead library
  with photocleavable mass tags; (b) process illustration of phage display involving
  recombinant antibody (rAB) phage pool for an extensive biased screening of peptides;
  (c) illustrative representation of reporter gene assay measuring gene expression
  level in response to an interference with cellular signalling pathway. Created with
