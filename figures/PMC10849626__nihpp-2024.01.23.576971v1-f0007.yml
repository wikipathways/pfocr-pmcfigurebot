caption: Biosynthesis of clavusporins. a, Workflow for in vivo reconstitution of peptide
  methylations by co-expression of MBP-tagged precursor peptide and the modification
  enzymes. b-g, HPLC-coupled HR-MS analysis of MpcA core peptides from MBP-peptide
  fusions after column-enrichment and trypsin digestion. Shown are extracted ion chromatograms
  of MpcA1â€“13 (core peptide) with or without methylation, as indicated. The traces
  are offset on the y axis for clarity. h, Proposed biosynthetic pathway of clavusporins
