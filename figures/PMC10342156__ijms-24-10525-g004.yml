figure_title: The dynamics of subpathways in follicles from primordial to preovulatory
  stages.
caption: The dynamics of subpathways in follicles from primordial to preovulatory
  stages. (A) Identification of subpathway by k-clique algorithm. The left histogram
  is the distribution of the number of genes among 725 subpathways ranging from 3
  to 399. The middle histogram is the number of subpathways among each pathway ranging
  from 1 to 20. The right table lists corresponding subpathways for a given pathway.
  (B) The difference between “Cell cycle”, “mTOR signaling pathway”, “ErbB signaling
  pathway”, and “FoxO signaling pathway” and their corresponding subpathways in follicles
  from primordial to preovulatory stages. Take “Cell cycle” pathway as example; the
  left heat map shows the ssGSEA score between “Cell cycle” pathway and 5 subpathways
  (04110_3, 04110_4, 04110_6, 04110_8, and 04110_9). The right line chart indicates
  the dynamic change in pathway specificity; red line represents the entire pathway,
  whereas other color lines represent corresponding subpathways
