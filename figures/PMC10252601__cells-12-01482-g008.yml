caption: 'Chronic kidney disease (CKD) reprograms the fibrogenic process in veins
  by transdifferentiating vein fibroblasts and upregulating 18 fibroblast genes and
  reprograms the fibrogenic process in veins by upregulating 6 fibrotic genes and
  primes CKD vein for AVF failure and multiple organ failure. (A) The gene expression
  changes of the fibroblast genes in the veins of CKD patients compared to non-CKD
  controls. CKD upregulated 18 and downregulated 34 out of 52 differentially modulated
  fibroblast genes in veins. The 461 fibroblast genes were collected from the HPA.
  (B) Metascape pathway analysis showed the top pathways of the 18 CKD-upregulated
  fibroblast genes. (C) The gene expression changes of the fibrogenic genes in the
  veins of CKD patients compared to non-CKD controls. CKD upregulated 6 and downregulated
  95 genes out of 101 differentially modulated fibrosis-related genes in veins. The
  959 fibrogenic genes in eight fibrotic diseases were collected from previous publication
  (PMID: 33519923). (D) Metascape analysis showed the top pathways of the 6 CKD upregulated
  fibrogenic genes'
