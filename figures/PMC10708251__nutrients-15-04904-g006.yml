figure_title: PAPS1 treatment inhibited NF-κB/STAT3-mediated inflammatory response
  in HFD-induced HLP mice.
caption: 'PAPS1 treatment inhibited NF-κB/STAT3-mediated inflammatory response in
  HFD-induced HLP mice. (A) PAPS1 treatment suppressed NF-κB/STAT3 signaling pathway
  and its related downstream proteins of liver in HFD-induced HLP mice. PAPS1 treatment
  down-regulated the hepatic levels of TNF-α (B), IL-1β (C), IL-6 (D), IL-17A (F),
  IL-22 (G), and IL-23 (H), and up-regulated the hepatic level of IL-10 (E) in HFD-induced
  HLP mice. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E.M. (n = 6). ## p < 0.01 and ### p
  < 0.001 vs. NCD group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 vs. HFD group;
  ^^ p < 0.01 vs. SV group. (I) PAPS1 treatment suppressed the hepatic level of P-NF-κB
  in HFD-induced HLP mice, as analyzed using IHC. NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB; P-NF-κB:
  phosphorylated NF-κB; STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3;
  P-STAT3: phosphorylated STAT3; Saa1: serum amyloid A protein; Hp: haptoglobin; IFN-γ:
  interferon-γ; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; IL-1β: interleukin-1β; HFD: high-fat
  diet; NCD: normal chow diet; PAPS1: Pleurotus abieticola polysaccharide; SV: simvastatin'
