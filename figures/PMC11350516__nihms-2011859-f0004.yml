figure_title: Both BAIBA enantiomers utilize the same receptor, MRGPRD
caption: (A) Immunoblotting analysis of MRGPRD in day-28 IDG-SW3 treated with 0–20
  μM L-BAIBA and D-BAIBA for 24 h.(B) Quantitative data for (A). Both BAIBA enantiomers
  significantly increased MRGPRD with a 4- to 6-fold greater amount compared to controls.
  MRGPRD expression levels were normalized by β-tubulin. Data are presented as mean
  ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, **p <
  0.01, ***p < 0.001) are calculated using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons.(C)
  50 μM MU6840, an antagonist against MRGPRD, blocked Fgf23 mRNA expression induced
  by 10 μM L-BAIBA (left), and 25 and 50 μM MU6840 blocked Sost mRNA expression induced
  by D-BAIBA in day-28 IDG-SW3. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological
  replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05) are calculated using two-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(D) Both BAIBA enantiomers elevated Fgf23
  and Sost mRNA in wild-type (WT) murine osteocyte-enriched bone fragments but not
  in Mrgprd-KO osteocytes ex vivo. There were no sex differences. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3–6 biological replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) are calculated using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons.(E) L-BAIBA elevated Fgf23 mRNA in WT bones but not in Mrgprd-KO bones
  in vivo. There were no sex differences. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3–8
  male or female animals per group), and p values (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001) are calculated
  using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(F) RT-qPCR analysis of Fgf23
  and Sost mRNA in day-28 IDG-SW3 pre-treated with 100 and 1,000 μM of one enantiomer
  before treatment with 10 μM of the opposite enantiomer. Neither enantiomer was blocked
  by the opposite enantiomer, even if 100-fold excess was used. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n =4 biological replicates per condition), and p values are calculated
  using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(G) BAIBA signaling pathway.
  L- and D-BAIBA utilize MRGPRD to regulate the transcription of Fgf23 and Sost, respectively.
  MU6840 is an antagonist against MRGPRD. Mrgprd-KO mice were also utilized in this
  study.See also Figure S6
