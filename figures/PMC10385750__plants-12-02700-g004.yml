  to GABA synthesis pathway.
caption: Differential metabolites and differentially expressed genes related to GABA
  synthesis pathway. In the box plot, the abscissa represents the sample and the ordinate
  represents the enrichment content for the differentially enriched metabolites. Blue
  is the test result of non-germinated seeds, and red is the test result of germinated
  seeds
