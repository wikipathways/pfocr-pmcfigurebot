caption: Leveraging patient-derived models to investigate intratumoral heterogeneity
  in colorectal cancer subtypes. Primary tumor tissues dissociated from colorectal
  cancer (CRC) patients serve as the starting point for generating diverse experimental
  models. Single-cell suspensions allow enrichment of adherent cancer cells while
  depleting non-malignant stromal components, maintaining intratumoral heterogeneity.
  The enriched cancer cells can be directly cultured as patient-derived cell lines
  or used to derive three-dimensional organoid cultures that recapitulate aspects
  of the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, these patient-derived cells can be
  modified through transfection with siRNA, shRNA, cDNA, or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
  before utilization in downstream applications. One key application is injection
  into immunocompromised mouse models to establish patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
  tumors. Sample collection from these in vivo models provides primary tumors, metastases,
  and liquid biopsy samples for comprehensive molecular analyses. Established CRC
  cell lines like HT-29 offer an alternative source for generating xenograft models
  and modified sublines. Multi-omics data acquisition through techniques like RNA
  sequencing, mass spectrometry proteomics, and identification of differentially expressed
  genes enables biomarker discovery, pathway analysis, and biological interpretation
  of distinct CRC subtypes. Potential therapeutic targets derived from these analyses
  are validated through antibody/drug treatment studies in the PDX and cell line xenograft
  models. This multifaceted strategy integrating patient-derived models, genetic modifications,
  organoids, xenografts, and multi-omics profiling facilitates investigations into
  the complexity of intratumoral heterogeneity underlying CRC. Figure created using
