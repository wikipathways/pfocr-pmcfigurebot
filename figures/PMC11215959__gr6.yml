caption: Trends in peripheral immune protein expression.A, relative expression levels
  of significantly changed proteins in CD4+ T cells at various stages of colorectal
  cancer (CRC). Red represents proteins with increasing expression, and blue represents
  proteins with decreasing expression. B, relative expression levels of significantly
  changed proteins in CD8+ T cells at various stages of CRC. C, relative expression
  levels of significantly changed proteins in monocytes at various stages of CRC.
  D, relative expression levels of significantly changed proteins in NK cells at various
  stages of CRC. E, Western blotting analysis of the extent of PTPRJ knockdown in
  Jurkat cells. F, PTPRJ knockdown does not affect T cell proliferation (n = 4 per
  group; mean ± standard error of the mean, Student’s t test). Non-significant (ns)
  p > 0.05, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001. G, biological process
  enrichment analysis of significantly changed proteins in sh-PTPRJ cells. H, heatmap
  of protein expression associated with the TCR signaling pathway in significantly
  changed proteins of sh-PTPRJ cells.
