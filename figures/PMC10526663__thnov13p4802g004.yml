  and attenuate HIR injury in mice.
caption: '5-ALA inhibits the RelA-CX3CR1 pathway to reprogram hepatic metabolism and
  attenuate HIR injury in mice. (A) Relative mRNA expression of chemokine receptors
  (Cx3cr1, Ccr1, Ccr2, Ccr5, Ccr7, Ccr8) in mouse macrophage cultures at indicated
  conditions (n = 6). The mRNA level of each gene is normalized to that of Actb. (B)
  Representative western blots of chemokine receptor proteins (CX3CR1, CCR1, CCR5)
  in mouse macrophage cultures 6 h after OGD/R (n = 3). Their signal intensity is
  normalized to that of ACTB. (C) Representative western blots of RelA (p65 NF-κB)
  and CX3CR1 in mouse primary hepatic macrophage cultures at indicated conditions
  (NF-κB activator: 8 μg/mL betulinic acid, 5-ALA: 1 mM, n = 3). Their signal intensity
  is normalized to that of ACTB. (D) Up: gross appearance of mouse livers following
  HIR (arrows denote areas of HIR injury); down: H&E staining of liver sections (areas
  of HIR injury are labeled by broken lines; scale bar = 0.1 mm) from WT and Cx3cr1
  KO mice at indicated conditions. (E) Suzuki''s score, AST, ALT and LDH levels in
  WT and Cx3cr1 KO mice 6 h after HIR (n = 6 for Suzuki''s score; n = 12 for AST,
  ALT and LDH measurements). (F) CX3CR1-GFP (green), TUNEL (red), and DAPI (blue)
  fluorescence in mouse liver sections at indicated conditions (n = 5; scale bar =
  10 μm). (G) Enrichment analysis on DEGs in WT and Cx3cr1 KO mouse liver samples
  following HIR. Orange, upregulated in Cx3cr1 KO mice; blue, downregulated in Cx3cr1
  KO mice. (H) Heatmap of DEGs related to metabolism of lipids (R-MMU-556833) at indicated
  conditions (n = 5 per group). Red, high relative expression; blue, low relative
  expression. Results are presented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
  by two-tailed Student''s t tests (B), (E) and (F) or one-way ANOVA (A) and (C)'
