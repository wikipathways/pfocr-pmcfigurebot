  of Akt1, PDK1, HIF-1α, TGF-β1, Smad2, Smad3, α-SMA, Bcl-2, VEGF-A, SphK1, Snail,

caption: 'Expression of genes related to PDK1 and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways in
  yellow cattle and yak PASMCs: (A–L) correspond to the relative mRNA expression of
  Akt1, PDK1, HIF-1α, TGF-β1, Smad2, Smad3, α-SMA, Bcl-2, VEGF-A, SphK1, Snail, and

  The results were normalized to the normoxic (control) group of yellow cattle; ns
  indicates the difference is not significant (p > 0.05), * indicates the difference
  is significant (p < 0.05), ** indicates the difference is significant (p < 0.01),
  *** indicates a highly significant difference (p < 0.001)'
