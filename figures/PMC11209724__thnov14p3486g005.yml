caption: The m6A modification governs NF-κB signaling in macrophage polarization.
  (A) m6A abundance of mRNA associated with TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS-treated
  RAW 264.7 cells detected by PCR array and MeRIP without RNA fragment procedure;
  n = 3 per group. (B) The protein levels of MyD88 and Traf6 of RAW264.7 cells after
  treatment with NC, LPS+NC, siM3&14, LPS+OE-M3&14. siRNAs or overexpression plasmids
  were transfected 24 hours before LPS treatment. (C) Quantification of MyD88 and
  Traf6 protein levels in the above cells of (B), normalized to GAPDH. n = 3 per group.
  (D) qRT-PCR analysis of MyD88 mRNA stability in RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS+NC
  or LPS+siM3&14 following treatment with actinomycin D (ActD, 2.5 μg/mL). n = 5 per
  group. (E) catRAPID fragments-based prediction of interaction between METTL3 and
  MyD88 mRNA and maps METTL3 interaction domains to nts 40-392 (5'-end). (F) Prediction
  sites of MyD88 mRNA m6A peaks as produced from SRAMP. (G) Schematic of MyD88 mRNA
  segments for MeRIP-qPCR primers. (H) MeRIP-qPCR was performed to detect the m6A
  abundance of MyD88 in LPS-treated cells. n = 3 per group. (I) Immunoblot for MyD88,
  p65, and p-p65 (Ser536) of total lysate, p65 and p50 of nuclear lysates, which were
  extracted from RAW264.7 cells treated with NC, siRNA of MyD88 (siMyD88), OE-M3&14,
  OE-M3&14+siMyD88. (J) Quantification of protein contents of MyD88, p-p65, p65 and
  p-p65/p65 of total lysate normalized to GAPDH, p65 and p50 of nuclear lysate normalized
  to Lamin B1. n = 4 per group. (K and L) Expression of the MyD88 mRNA and protein
  were measured in RAW264.7 cells transfected with siRNA of NC, YTHDF1 (siYF1), YTHDF3
  (siYF3) and YTHDC1 (siYC1), which were top 3 rated readers of predictive global
  scores for interaction with propensity between readers and mRNA of MyD88, according
  to catRAPID. n = 8 per group. (M) Immunoblot for MyD88, p65, and p-p65 (Ser536)
  of total lysate, p65 and p50 of nuclear lysates, which were extracted from RAW264.7
  cells treated with NC, siYF3, OE-M3&14, OE-M3&14+siYF3. (N) Quantification of protein
  contents of MyD88, p-p65, p65 and p-p65/p65 of total lysate normalized to GAPDH,
  p65 and p50 of nuclear lysate normalized to Lamin B1. n = 4 per group. (O) qRT-PCR
  analysis of MyD88 mRNA stability in RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS+OE-M3&14 and
  LPS+OE-M3&14+siYF3 following treatment with ActD (2.5 μg/mL). n = 4 per group. For
  (C), (D), (H), (J), (K), (N) and (O), n ≥ 3 per group. The data are expressed as
  the mean ± SD. P-values were determined by one-way ANOVA with Fisher's LSD post-hoc
  test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001.
