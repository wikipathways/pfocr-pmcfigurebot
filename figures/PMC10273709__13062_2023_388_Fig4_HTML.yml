caption: H19X-encoded miRNAs share target genes enriched in Wnt signaling pathways.
  A Analysis of shared target genes of H19X-encoded miRNAs using TargetScan. The numbers
  of overlapping target genes are presented in the table. B KEGG pathway analysis
  of genes that are downregulated by IL-4 and targeted by two or more miRNAs. C A
  functional module analysis for genes that are downregulated by IL-4 and targeted
  by two or more miRNAs. Among several cluster modules, a regulatory network of Wnt
  signalingâ€“related genes is shown
article_title: H19X-encoded microRNAs induced by IL-4 in adipocyte precursors regulate
  proliferation to facilitate differentiation.
