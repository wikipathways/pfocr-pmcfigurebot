caption: 'The concentrations of Mets-associated proteins in human serum can be used
  to evaluate SCI. Scatterplot of the concentrations of cf-DNA, CD68, and CitH3 in
  serum of healthy volunteers and patients at different SCI stages. Data are presented
  as Mean ± SD (n = 6).  ∗P < 0.05 vs. volunteer group; #P < 0.05 vs. acute SCI group;
   ∧P < 0.05 vs. subacute SCI group (one-way analysis of variance followed by the
  least significant difference test) (a, c, e). Linear regression analysis between
  ASIA score and the concentrations of cf-DNA, CD68, and CitH3 in serum of all subjects,
  respectively (b, d, f).r2 is the coefficient of determination. The value range of
  r2 is 0 to 1. P < 0.001 means a linear regression relationship between the X and
  Y variable.'
