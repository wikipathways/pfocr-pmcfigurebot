caption: Contribution of hypoxia to the heterogeneity of cancer epithelial cells (A)
  PCA of metabolic gene expression levels in different cell types. Top PCs accounting
  for 80% of the variance are highlighted in red (B) Dot plot of metabolic pathways
  enriched in genes explaining the heterogeneity between cells (C) Scatter plot of
  pathway activities involved in glycolysis, OXPHOS, and a response to hypoxia, based
  on single epithelial cell data. The color indicates the local density of the dots
  (D) Same as in (C) but for bulk STAD data from TCGA (E) Box plot of the expression
  levels of HIF1A among different cell types at a single-cell resolution (F) Box plot
  of the expression levels of HIF1A in STAD tumor samples and the corresponding normal
  samples.
