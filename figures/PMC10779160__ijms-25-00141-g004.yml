figure_title: Effects of KBL346 on immune signaling pathways in macrophage.
caption: Effects of KBL346 on immune signaling pathways in macrophage. (a) Schematic
  representation of cellular signaling pathway of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in macrophages.
  (b,c) After coculture of KBL346 and RAW264.7 cells at ratios of 10:1 and 100:1,
  phosphorylation and expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; blue in
  (a)) in MAPK signaling pathway or nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB; green in (a)) in the
  NF-κB signaling pathway were determined using immunochemical method. As a positive
  control group, treatment with 10 ng/mL concentration of LPS was used. β-actin was
  used as an internal loading control
