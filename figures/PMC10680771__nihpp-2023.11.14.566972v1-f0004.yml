figure_title: GCN2-mediated autophagy may release stored EAAs under EAA deprivation
caption: a) Starving GCN2-null flies of Phe shortens lifespan in comparison to GCN2-null
  flies fed all AAs and wildtype flies fed all AAs or no Phe (P < 0.001 in all comparisons).
  b) To test whether lifespan of GCN2-null flies under Phe deprivation can be rescued
  by ISR activation, we deprived flies of both Phe and Tyr and measured lifespan.
  Deprivation of Tyr partially rescued GCN2-null lifespan from the cost of Phe deprivation
  (P = 0.017). c) The ISR can also be activated via pharmacological inhibition of
  mTOR. Addition of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to the food partially rescues GCN2-null
  lifespan under Phe deprivation (P < 0.001). d) ISR activation ultimately results
  in an upregulation of autophagy. To test whether autophagy is required for survival
  under Phe deprivation, we expressed Atg1 RNAi in the fat body and gut then deprived
  the flies of Phe. Atg1 RNAi flies deprived of Phe had reduced lifespan compared
  to those fed all AAs (P < 0.001). e) These lifespan data suggest that under EAA
  deprivation, GCN2 may activate autophagy to release stored EAAs and thus sustain
  lifelong somatic maintenance. Our proposed model for this mechanism combines many
  individually well-characterised signalling events, from studies in an array of model
  systems, to form a pathway that connects AA deprivation to autophagy and encompasses
  the two major AA sensors (GCN2 and mTOR). Grey ovals represent proteins involved
  in the signalling pathway. Each protein interaction is accompanied by a reference
  in square brackets for a study in which the interaction has been observed, and these
  interactions are expanded upon in Table S2
