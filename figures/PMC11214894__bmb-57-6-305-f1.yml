caption: 'Effects of PLST upregulation on cell migration, invasion and morphological
  changes in H460 and H1299 cells. (A) The cells were transfected with EV or PLST
  OV, which is based on pcDNA6/V5-His B plasmid vector, using LipofectaminTM 3000
  reagent. Then, qRT-PCR was performed to examine the mRNA expression level of PLST.
  (B) Western blotting analysis was performed to examine the protein expression level
  of PLST. V5 was used as a protein tag of exogenous PLST. (C) Wound healing assay
  was performed to measure migratory ability by PLST overexpression in H460 and H1299
  cells. Wound healing process was observed using a microscope. Quantitative analysis
  of increase in wound-healing ability by PLST overexpression in H460 and H1299 cells.
  Scale bar: 100 μm. (D) Cell migration assay was performed to examine cell migratory
  ability by PLST overexpression using a Boyden chamber in H460 and H1299 cells. The
  migrated cells on the bottom surface of membrane were observed using a microscope.
  Quantitative analysis of increase of migrated cell number by PLST overexpression
  in H460 and H1299 cells. Scale bar: 100 μm. (E) Cell invasion assay was performed
  to determine cell invasive ability by PLST overexpression using a Boyden chamber
  in H460 and H1299 cells. The invaded cells on the bottom surface of membrane were
  observed using a microscope. Quantitative analysis of increase of invaded cell number
  by PLST overexpression in H460 and H1299 cells. Scale bar: 100 μm. (F) F-actin staining
  assay was performed to examine the cell morphological change of H460 and H1299 cells
  by PLST overexpression. Scale bar: 50 μm. These results are the average of three
  independent experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SD (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).'
