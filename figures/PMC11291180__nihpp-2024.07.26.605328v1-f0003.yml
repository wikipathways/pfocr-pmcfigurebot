figure_title: A second X chromosome influences protein expression across the genome
caption: '(a) Proteomics analysis of hippocampi from aged Gnx female mice (n=4 XO;
  n=6 XX) (age: 22–24 months). Volcano plot of protein expression comparing aged Gnx
  XO and aged Gnx XX females. Colored circles indicate significant differentially
  expressed proteins with a −log10(p-value) threshold of 2.8 which corresponds to
  an FDR value of 0.052. 103 significant proteins were detected, and the top eight
  differentially expressed proteins are labeled.(b) Chromosome map displaying the
  location of X chromosome genes corresponding to significant differentially expressed
  X proteins. Color indicates the genotype with higher protein expression.(c) Bar
  plot of the proportion of genes corresponding to significant differentially expressed
  proteins by chromosome number. A second X chromosome influences protein expression
  across the genome.(d) Ingenuity pathway analysis highlighting the top biological
  pathways that are significantly different between aging XX and XO females. A second
  X increases synaptogenesis signaling. Threshold indicates a −log10(p-value) of 1.3
  which corresponds to a p-value of 0.05. Color indicates the genotype with higher
  pathway expression'
