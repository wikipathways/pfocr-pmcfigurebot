caption: 'F3 promotes proliferation and migration of GBM cells through activating
  NF-κB pathway under hypoxia. (A) The results of EdU assays in hypoxic OE-F3-LN229
  and OE-F3-U87 cells treated with PDTC. Representative pictures are on left and quantitative
  data are on right. Scale bar: 100 μm. (B) Transwell assays of OE-F3-LN229 and OE-F3-U87
  cells treated with PDTC. Representative pictures are on left and quantitative data
  are shown on right. Scale bar: 100 μm. (C) Wound-healing assays show hypoxic OE-F3-LN229
  and OE-F3-U87 hypoxic cells treated with PDTC. Representative pictures are on top
  and quantitative data are shown on bottom. Scale bar: 100 μm. (D) Representative
  images of Western Blot show the protein levels of F3, NF-κB p65, phospho-NF-κB p65,
  Bcl-2 and EMT-related markers (E-cadherin and N-cadherin) in hypoxic OE-F3-LN229
  cells treated with PDTC. (E) Relative expression of NF-κB downstream genes in OE-F3-LN229
  and OE-F3-U87 cells after PDTC treatment validated by RT-qPCR. Data are shown as
  mean ± SEM (error bars) and were analyzed using ANOVA test (A-E)'
