caption: Untargeted metabolomics of Sphingomonas sediminicola in R2A medium. (a,b)
  Heatmap of differential metabolites in positive (a) and negative (b) ion modes.
  Each row corresponds to a differentially expressed metabolite, while each column
  represents a specific sample. The color gradient, ranging from green to red, indicates
  the abundance level of the differentially expressed metabolites, with green representing
  low abundance and red representing high abundance. (c,d) Volcano plot of differential
  metabolites in positive (a) and negative (b) ion modes. Each point represents a
  metabolite, horizontal coordinates indicate different multiplicities of differential
  metabolites (log2 values), vertical coordinates indicate p-values (−log10 values),
  grey indicates metabolites with no significant differences, red indicates up-regulated
  metabolites (Up), and green indicates down-regulated metabolites (Down). (e,f) bubble
  plots of metabolic pathway enrichment in positive (e) and negative (f) ion modes.
  The x-axis in the figure represents the ratio of differentiated metabolites in a
  specific metabolic pathway to the total number of identified metabolites within
  that pathway (RichFactor). A higher value indicates a greater enrichment of differential
  metabolites in the pathway. The color of the dots corresponds to the p-value obtained
  from the hypergeometric test. A smaller p-value indicates a more reliable test.
  The size of the dots represents the number of differential metabolites present in
  the respective metabolic pathway
