figure_title: Nuclear DNA is hypermethylated in IF1-KO cells regulating a mitochondrial
  gene expression program
caption: 'A) Heatmap of commonly differentially methylated and expressed genes (DMEGs).
  The color scheme is presented as a log2 fold change (log2FC). Shades of red represent
  upregulated and hypermethylated genes (log2FC > 0) and shades of blue represent
  downregulated and hypomethylated genes (log2FC < 0). Left track (mRNA) is gene expression
  from RNA-seq and right track (5meC) is IF1-KO UCP4 vs. IF1-KO. DMEGs were grouped
  in 4 clusters based on promoter methylation and gene expression change, respectively:
  1) hypermethylated and upregulated, 2) hypermethylated and downregulated, 3) hypomethylated
  and upregulated, and 4) hypomethylated and downregulated. B and C) GO analysis of
  DMEG of clusters 2 and 3, respectively. −Log10 FDR values on the y-axis, and combined
  score on the x-axis. D-F) Bar graph of ΔΨM as measured by ΔΨM-dependent dye TMRE
  normalized to the ΔΨM-independent dye MTG. Y axis depicts the TMRE/MTG ratio, black
  bar ΔΨM in WT cells, and red bar, ΔΨM in IF1-KO cells. D) Red-bordered bar, ΔΨM
  in IF1-KO cells treated for 3 days with DNP 25 μM. E) Blue bar, ΔΨM in IF1-RSC cells.
  F) Light blue bar, ΔΨM in IF1-KO UCP4 expressing cells. Statistical difference by
  One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test. G) Violin plot showing DNA methylation status
  across the entire genome in all 4 genotypes; the Y-axis depicts probe values; white
  lines indicate the median and dotted lines the quartiles. Numerical values below
  the violin plot are the median for each genotype. H) Heatmap of DMEGs in clusters
  2 and 3 from A. The color scheme is presented as average delta beta (AVGΔbeta, see
  methods). Shades of red represent hypermethylated genes (AVGΔbeta > 0) and shades
  of blue represent hypomethylated genes (AVGΔbeta < 0). The left track (KO) is IF1-KO
  vs. WT, the middle track (RSC) is IF1-RSC vs. IF1-KO, and the right track (UCP4)
  is IF1-KO UCP4 vs. IF1-KO. I) Heatmap of representative pathways as in Fig. 2H.
  KO is IF1-KO vs. WT, and UCP4 is IF1-KO UCP4 vs. IF1-KO. J) Heatmap of biological
  processes (as per Gene Ontology analysis) of mitochondrial genes from DMEG of each
  paired comparison. The color scheme is presented False Discovery Rate (FDR). Left
  track (KO) is IF1-KO vs. WT, middle track (RSC) is IF1-RSC vs. IF1-KO, and right
  track (UCP4) is IF1-KO UCP4 vs. IF1-KO'
