figure_title: Cardiac function was improved with MCOPPB administration
caption: 'A) Echocardiography results show longitudinal plot of changes in average
  ejection fraction (graph on left) and individual relative percent changes in ejection
  fraction (graph on right) associated with saline (black line) and MCOPPB (orange
  line) administration, started at day 21 after myocardial infarction induction. Ejection
  fraction significantly improved in the MCOPPB group (MCOPPB vs saline at 2 months
  follow-up, 58±3 vs 45±2, p<0.001, MCOPPB vs saline at euthanasia, 67±3 vs 43±2,
  p<0.001). Two-tailed ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used. n=6/group.B)
  Systolic wall thickness increased in MCOPPB group. LV wall thickness was measured
  by echocardiography with short axis M-mode image, at interventricular wall (left),
  and posterior wall (right). Both end-systolic interventricular septum (IVS) (left)
  and end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW) (right) were significantly
  greater in MCOPPB group compared to saline group at euthanasia (end-systolic IVS,
  MCOPPB vs saline, 2.2±0.5mm vs 1.1±0.3mm, p<0.01, end-systolic LVPW, MCOPPB vs saline,
  2.7±0.2mm vs 2.1±0.3mm, p<0.05). Two-tailed ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test
  was applied. n=6/group. Orange line: MCOPPB group, black line : saline group.C)
  End-systolic volume was significantly decreased in MCOPPB-received group at euthanasia.
  End-systolic volume was calculated with VenoLAB software: (7.0/(2.4+LVIDs))xLVIDs3,
  LVIDs=left ventricular internal diameter end systole). End-systolic volume was significantly
  decreased in MCOPPB-received group at euthanasia (MCOPPB vs saline, 140±30μL vs
  280±44 μL, p<0.001). Orange line: MCOPPB group, Black line: Saline group. Two-tailed
  ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test was used. n=6/group.D) MCOPPB decreased extent
  of left ventricular wall fibrosis. The percent of left ventricular wall fibrosis
  was determined by Masson-Trichrome staining of the sections of myocardial tissue
  harvested 3 months after the administration of MCOPPB or saline (Figure 1D). Fibrosis
  area significantly decreased in MCOPPB group (% fibrosis area, MCOPPB vs saline,
  14±2 vs 29±10, p<0.05). Two-tailed t-test was used.F) MCOPPB increased angiogenesis
  in infarcted heart. Myocardial angiogenesis was analyzed by immunohistochemical
  staining with CD31 antibody. The number of capillaries was counted with two slides
  per animal, most positive cells found in peri-infarct region (x200 magnification).
  MCOPPB group had significantly higher vessel counts in border zone (44±12 vs 16±4,
  p<0.01). The graph shows the number of vessels/field. n=6/group. Two-tailed t test
  was used. Photo-images are two representative slides from saline and MCOPPB groups.
  Scale bar=150μm.G) NPPA and NPPB were downregulated by MCOPPB. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes
  were treated with nociception agonist, MCOPPB (0.5mM), ET-1 (100nM) and anti-ORL1(ORL1
  antagonist, [Nphe1]Nociceptin(1–13)NH2]) (10mM). qPCR shows that NPPA and NPPB,
  which are downstream transcription genes of NFAT signaling pathway and related to
  pathological hypertrophy, were downregulated by MCOPPB. Significantly, those downregulations
  by MCOPPB were diminished by adding ORL1 antagonist. Two-tailed ANOVA with Bonferroni
  post hoc test was used. Primers for NPPA: forward, 5’-CGTATACAGTGCGGTGTCCAAC-3’.
  reverse, 5’-CATCTTCTCCTCCAGGTGGTCTAG-3’. Primers for NPPB: forward, 5’-AAGTCCTAGCCAGTCTCCAGAACA
  −3’. Reverse, 5’-TTGAGAGCTGTCTCTGAGCCATT-3’.H) ORL1 inhibitor increased nuclear
  dephosphorylated NFAT. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated with MCOPPB (0.5
  μM), ET-1 (100nM) and anti-ORL1 (10 μM). Nucler fractions of cells were extracted
  using NE-PER nuclear reagents kit and analyzed by western blotting with NFATc4 antibody(Santa
  Cruz Biotechnology- SC 271597). Lamin b (Santa Cruz Biotechnology- SC 374015) was
  used as a loading control. NFATc4 expression was significantly increased by adding
  ORL1 antagonist'
