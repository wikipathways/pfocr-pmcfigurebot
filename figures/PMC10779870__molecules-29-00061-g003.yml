figure_title: Fucoxanthin upregulated the mRNA expression of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  genes in TNF-α-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells.
caption: 'Fucoxanthin upregulated the mRNA expression of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  genes in TNF-α-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells. Fucoxanthin upregulated the expression
  of 3 genes in the TNF-α-stimulated PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells.
  These genes include forkhead box 1 (FOXO1) (A), Ras P21 protein activator (RASA1)
  (B), and Rho family protein A (RHOA) (C). Each data point represents the mean ±
  SEM, representing 4 treatments: control (cells + DMSO), fucoxanthin (6.25 µM), TNF-α
  (50 ng/mL), and fucoxanthin (6.25 µM) + TNF-α (50 ng/mL). A t-test was used to evaluate
  statistically significant differences between TNF-α and fucoxanthin + TNF-α. ns
