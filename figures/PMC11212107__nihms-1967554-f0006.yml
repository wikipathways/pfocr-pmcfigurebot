figure_title: The JAK/STAT pathway mediates the effect of dietary fat on sweet sensation
  and fatty acid perception
caption: (A) Gr64f-Gal4>dome-IR flies on control diet (CD) show decreased sugar PER
  (filled line) compared to genetic control flies (Gr64f-Gal4/+ and dome-IR/+ dotted
  lines). n = 20–40 flies per group.(B) Gr64f-Gal4>dome-IR flies on CD (gray line)
  and HFD (yellow line) show similar sugar PER. n = 20–40 flies(C) HFD-fed Gr64f-Gal4>dome-IR
  flies show lower sugar PER compared to the genetic controls (Gr64f-Gal4/+ and dome-IR/+);
  n = 20–40 flies.(D) Hexanoic acid PER of Gr64f-Gal4>dome-IR and genetic control
  (Gr64f-Gal4/+ and dome-IR/+) flies fed CD (gray), HFD, (yellow), and HSD (red);
  n = 20–40 flies.(E) Gr64f-Gal4>Stat92E-IR flies on CD show decreased sugar PER (filled
  line) compared to genetic control flies (Gr64f-Gal4/+ and Stat92E-IR/+ dotted lines).(F)
  Gr64f-Gal4>Stat92E-IR flies on CD (gray line) and HFD (yellow line) show similar
  sugar PER. n = 20.(G) HFD-fed Gr64f-Gal4>Stat92E-IR show lower sugar PER compared
  to the genetic controls (Gr64f-Gal4/+ and Stat92E-IR/+); n = 20.(H) Hexanoic acid
  PER of Gr64f-Gal4>Stat92E-IR and genetic control (Gr64f-Gal4/+ and Stat92E-IR/+)
  flies fed CD (gray), HFD (yellow), and HSD (red); n = 20–40 flies. Data are presented
  as means ± SEM. Median (midline) and 75% quantiles (dashed lines) are depicted (D
  and H). Statistical analysis was performed with two-tailed Mann-Whitney tests (B
  and F) or Kruskal-Wallis H tests (A, C–E, G, and H). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p
  < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. For more information, please see Figure S4
