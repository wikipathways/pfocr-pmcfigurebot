  The Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, and Notch signaling pathways are responsible for the
  regulation of cancer stem cells within a tumor. These pathways play a crucial role
  in the ability of cancer stem cells to undergo self-renewal and differentiate into
  various cell types [,108,109,110,111]. The regulation of cell cycle entry and exit
  is governed by several key factors, namely p16INK4a, p19ARF, RB, and p53 [113].
  These crucial components play a pivotal role in maintaining the delicate balance
  of cell division and preventing the onset of cancer. The genes that have been identified
  as the hub genes associated with the recurrence of AML are TNF, IL6, TLR4, VEGFA,
  PTPRC, TLR7, TLR1, CD44, CASP1, and CD68 [126]. The modulation of various biological
  entities, such as the transcription factor HIF-1α, the DNA-binding protein CTCF
  motif, the proto-oncogene MYC, LAMB3, RUNX2, and Oct4, is influenced by the presence
  of CpG-methylated recognition site sequences [129,130]. The miR-200, miR-9, and
  miR-200b-200a-429 molecules hold significant significance in the intricate mechanism
  of DNA methylation regulation within cancer stem cells [131,132,133,134,135]
