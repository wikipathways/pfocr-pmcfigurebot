figure_title: Characterization of two representative biased signaling pathways of
  dopamine D2 receptors.
caption: 'Characterization of two representative biased signaling pathways of dopamine
  D2 receptors. Receptor expression levels were between 1.7-1.9 pmol/mg protein. Knockdown
  cells of arrestin2 (Arr2-KD), arrestins3 (Arr3-KD), and arrestin2 and arrestin3
  (Arr2/3-KD) were described in our recent publication (Min et al., 2023). The knockdown
  efficiencies were about 90-95%. (A) HEK-293 cells were transfected with the cDNA
  of WT-D2R, D2G, or D2Arr, and reporter gene assay was conducted as described in
  the Materials and Methods. The CRE-luci values of the D2Arr group were significantly
  different from those of the other experimental groups at the concentration of quinpirole
  (Quin) between 10–10 M and 10–8 M (p<0.001, n=3). (B) HEK-293 cells expressing D2G
  or D2Arr were treated with 50 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) overnight. Cells were
  treated with either vehicle or 1 μM DA for 5 min. ERK assay was conducted as described
  in the Materials and Methods. **p<0.01 compared to corresponding vehicle groups
  (n=3). (C) Con-KD or Arr2/3-KD cells were transfected with D2Arr or D2G. Cells were
  treated with either vehicle or 1 μM DA for 5 min. **p<0.01 compared to corresponding
  vehicle groups (n=3). #p<0.05, ##p<0.01 compared to Veh/Con-KD/D2Arr group (n=3).
  (D) Con-KD, Arr2-KD, or Arr3-KD cells were transfected with D2Arr. Cells were treated
  with either vehicle or 1 μM DA for 5 min. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to corresponding
  vehicle groups (n=3). ###p<0.001 compared to Veh/Con-KD group (n=3)'
