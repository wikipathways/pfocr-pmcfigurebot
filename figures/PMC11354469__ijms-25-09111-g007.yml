caption: The integrative analysis of transcriptome and metabolome. (A) Joint Pathway
  Analysis between the upregulated DAMs and DEGs in S. algae versus E. coli OP50.
  (B) Joint Pathway Analysis between the downregulated DAMs and DEGs in S. algae versus
  E. coli OP50. Each circle represents a single metabolic pathway, with the size of
  the circle proportional to the pathway’s impact. The color indicates the pathway’s
  significance, ranging from highest (red) to lowest (yellow). The enrichment analysis
  was performed using a hypergeometric test, and the topology measure was assessed
  by degree centrality. (C) The network visualization of STITCH interactions was generated
  using Cytoscape. Interactions between significant DAMs (square) and DEGs (circle)
  are displayed, with the edge thickness proportional to the interaction score in
  the STITCH database. The orange and blue node color indicates the upregulated and
  downregulated DEGs/DAMs in S. algae compared with E. coli OP50. Green, red, and
  gray edges represent interactions between metabolite–gene, metabolite–metabolite,
  and gene–gene, respectively
