caption: A current model showing BES1/BZR1 family members are involved in several
  signal pathways. In a classical BR signaling pathway, BRI1-BR-BAK1 regulates gene
  expression mainly via the BES1/BZR1 transcription factors family, which have been
  well characterized within the past two-and-a-half decades. Genetic and biochemical
  analyses indicated that the EMS1-TPD1-SERK1/SERK2 regulates tapetum development
  through activating BES1 and its paralogs. BES1 and BZR1 directly regulate the expression
  of tapetum developmental genes, such as SPL, DYT1, and TDF1. The TDR-TDIF-BAK1 signaling
  pathway regulates xylem cell differentiation via BES1/BZR1 family members. A plasma
  membrane-associated OPS regulates phloem differentiation via activating BES1. However,
  it is unclear whether there is an undefined RLK which can interact with OPS. NILR1
  plays a role in seed germination and cell expansion. Co-receptor BAK1 is shared
  by NILR1, and downstream components may also be the same as those in the BRI1-BR-BAK1
  signaling pathway. Question marks represent unconfirmed steps.
