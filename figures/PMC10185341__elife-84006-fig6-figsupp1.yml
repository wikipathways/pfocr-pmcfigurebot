figure_title: 'Comparison of coordination spheres of different Mn2+-binding proteins:
  MntR, a Mn2+ regulator (PDB ID: 1ON1) (); PsaA, the solute-binding protein domain
  of Mn2+-transporting ATP-binding cassette transporter (PDB ID: 3ZTT) (); and the
  DraNramp WT•Mn2+ occluded structure (this work)'
caption: In all structures, Mn2+ binds in an octahedral coordination. The geometry
  is more distorted (RMSangle=25°) and bond distances are longer in DraNramp, perhaps
  to enable Mn2+ transport and the associated protein dynamics. In comparison, the
  geometry is close to ideal (RMSangle=8°) and bond distances shorter in MntR, where
  Mn2+ binding, but not transport, is essential for regulating downstream signaling.
article_title: High-resolution structures with bound Mn2+ and Cd2+ map the metal import
  pathway in an Nramp transporter.
