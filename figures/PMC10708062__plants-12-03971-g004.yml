  in leaves and roots in response to osmotic stress.
caption: Analysis of DEGs involved in carbohydrate metabolism and soluble sugars in
  leaves and roots in response to osmotic stress. (a) Major metabolism pathway and
  key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism. (b) The expression patterns of DEGs involved
  in carbohydrate metabolism. (c,d) Soluble sugar levels in leaves and roots in response
  to 50 h of osmotic stress. The dashed lines in pathway represent participation,
  the dashed boxes represent pathway, the solid lines in pathway represents synthesis.
  The color spectrum of heat map ranging from blue to red represents the log2 FC from
  low to high, |Log2FC| ≥ 1. The soluble sugars were measured after 50 h of treatment
  with 25% PEG. RCK and LCK indicate the control roots and leaves, respectively, while
  R-T50 and L-T50 indicate the samples of roots and leaves after 50 h of treatment
  with 25% PEG. All data are presented as means ± SE from three independent experiments.
  The asterisks * and ** indicate significant difference at p < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively
