caption: The differential expression profile of transcriptomics and metabolics in
  phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and isoflavonoid biosynthesis
  in three stages during E. ulmoides AR development. (A) Metabolic pathway map and
  differential expression profile of metabolite contents. The purple boxes, green
  boxes, and gray boxes represent significant up-regulation, significant down-regulation,
  and no significant change for metabolite contents in H6S1 vs. H8S1, H6S2 vs. H8S2,
  and H6S3 vs. H8S3, respectively. (B) The differential expression profile of genes
  in the pathways. The red boxes, blue boxes, and gray boxes represent significant
  up-regulation, significant down-regulation, and no significant change for gene expression
  in H6S1 vs. H8S1, H6S2 vs. H8S2, and H6S3 vs. H8S3, respectively. The color depth
  of boxes represents the size of log2 fold change
