figure_title: PI3K signaling in podocyte health and disease
caption: (A) PI3K signaling is vital for the maintenance of podocyte identity, structure,
  survival, and function. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and its downstream effectors
  regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics and survival signaling via slit diaphragm proteins
  such as CD2AP, Nephrin, NEPH1, and podocin. (B) Derangements of PI3K signaling can
  lead to podocyte dysfunction and the loss of slit diaphragm integrity. The somatic
  gain-of-function mutation, p.H1047R, drives hyperactivation of p110Î±, podocyte hyperplasia,
  dedifferentiation, loss of slit diaphragm protein expression, and the loss of glomerular
  integrity. (C) Yamaguchi et al. (21) demonstrated that BYL719 (alpelisib) effectively
  reduced podocyte PI3K activation and glomerular injury in a patient with proliferative
  glomerulonephritis caused by the p.H1047R mutation and in experimental models of
  proliferative glomerulonephritis
