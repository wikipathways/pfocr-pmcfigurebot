figure_title: Mechanisms of inflammation on NAFLD progression
caption: (A) TNF-α or LPS activates each receptor, such as TNFR and LPS4 or 9, leading
  to increase NF-κB phosphorylation through the activation of MAPK, STAT3, JNK, or
  AMPK expression. Additionally, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes
  to mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammasome activation, which in turn accelerate
  IL-1β maturation and secretion. (B) miR-34a inhibited MAPK-mediated NF-κB phosphorylation
  via activation of TLR4, which is triggered by LPS or high-glucose levels. Besides,
  NF-κB-mediated TNF-α induction activates its receptor and activated inflammatory
  signaling pathway. However, this signaling pathway is inactivated by miR-125b/TRNAIP3-mediated
  TNF-α receptor ubiquitination. In addition, IL-6 secretion by NF-κB activation increased
  phosphorylation of STAT3 and activated miR-233-enriched exosome which was source
  of IL-6 over production. Accelerated inflammatory signaling pathway induced PERK-mediated
  eIF2α phosphorylation suppressed by miR-26a and miR-26a suppressed eIF2α-activated
  NF-κB p65 translocation into nucleus. Moreover, high-glucose activated IRS-1/AKT
  signaling pathway and FOXO3 that suppressed by miR-122-5p activation. (C) The environment
  of the intestine and liver is closely linked to the disruption of gut microbiota,
  which can be induced by dysregulation of diets. Briefly, LPS secreted by disruption
  of gut microbiota increased gut inflammation through inactivating AMPK/PPARβ/δ mechanisms.
  Moreover, dephosphorylation of AMPK-mediated PPARα suppression caused by disruption
  of gut microbiota increased PGC1α-mediated lipid metabolisms and induced liver steatosis.
  In addition, activation of PPARγ stabilized cellular homeostasis through induction
  of IL-10 and iNOS mRNA expression. Furthermore, LPS comes from dysfunction of gut
  microbiota activated TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway in hepatocyte through
  blood flow in portal vein. NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; TNF-α, tumor
