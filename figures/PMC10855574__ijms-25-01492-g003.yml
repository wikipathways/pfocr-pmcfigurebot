figure_title: The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of DEGs.
caption: The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of DEGs. (A) A histogram of the GO enrichment
  analysis with the top 10 entries with the smallest p-value selected for each Biological
  Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), and Molecular Function (MF). The left bar
  is âˆ’log(p-value) and the right bar is the number of DEGs for the corresponding entry.
  (B) A bubble diagram of the KEGG enrichment analysis of differential genes. Pathways
  colored in red are closely related to plant disease resistance
