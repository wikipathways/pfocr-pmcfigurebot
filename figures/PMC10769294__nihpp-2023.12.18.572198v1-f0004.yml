figure_title: Pairwise K-mean clustering plots for different stress conditions
caption: A) Scatter plot of 24 hour of tryptophan starved (TRP24) and untreated (UTD24)
  CT; B) Scatter plot of 24 hour of iron starved (BPD24) and untreated (UTD24) CT;
  C) Scatter plot of 24 hour of tryptophan starved (TRP24) and 24 hour of iron starved
  (BPD24); D) Correlation of different scatterplots. These scatterplots and correlation
  between different stress conditions reveal CTL may behave similarly under different
  stress conditions; E) Scatter plot of 24 hour of iron starved (BPD24) and 16 hour
  of iron starved (BPD16) CTL; F) Scatter plot of 24 hour of tryptophan starved (TRP24)
  and 16 hour of tryptophan starved (TRP16) CT; G) Scatter plot of 16 hour of tryptophan
  starved (TRP16) and 16 hour of iron starved (BPD16); H) Correlation of different
  scatterplots. These scatterplots and correlation between different stress conditions
  reveals, CTL may have a global transcriptomics response; I) Pearson correlation
  matrix among different conditions. The correlation was calculated using two-tail
  test with 95% confidence interval; J) Heat map for number of reactions in each cluster
  for different conditions; K) Gene ontology enrichment chart for common genes in
  green cluster across all conditions; L) Hypothetical ppGpp pathway in CTL; M) Increased
  biomass growths for stress condition after introducing ppGpp pathway in CTL.
