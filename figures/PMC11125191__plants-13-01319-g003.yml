figure_title: GTGs regulate the ABA signaling pathway.
caption: GTGs regulate the ABA signaling pathway. GPCRs are a family of receptors
  with a seven-transmembrane helix (7TM) structure on the cell membrane. GPCR-type
  G proteins (GTGs) can bind the GTP-bound form of GTPase-accelerating protein 1 (GAP1),
  render the dephosphorylation of GTP-GAP1, and allow GDP-GAP1 to bind to and inhibit
  PLDα1. When ABA is present, PLDα1 is released, producing phosphatidic acid (PA)
  that induces stomatal closure and a series of physical processes [34]
