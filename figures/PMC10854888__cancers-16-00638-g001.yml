figure_title: Role of HSP in biochemical functions of cells.
caption: 'Role of HSP in biochemical functions of cells. (A) Chaperone activity: misfolded
  proteins that accumulate in the cytosol bind to HSPs to maintain homeostatic balance
  (A.1). For example, the HSP70/HSP40 complex guides the degradation of misfolded
  proteins into short peptides via proteasome (A.2). (B) Role of HSP in the autophagy
  pathway: the autophagy cycle begins by binding HSP70 to the protein (B.1). Regulation
  of Atg13, FIP200, and ULK1 complex induced by HSPs (B.2). The initiation of the
  VPS4, Atg14, and Beclin1 complexes is regulated by HSPs (B.3). Ultimately, phagosomes
  are formed using phagosomal markers (B.4). Finally, autophagosomes or amphisomes
  fuse with lysosomes (B.5). (C) Role of HSP in different apoptotic pathways: HSPs
  help in modulating pro-apoptotic signals through FasL at the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial
  levels. HSP70 and HSP27 appear to suppress the release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic
  proteins by activating Bax and tBid (truncated Bid), respectively (C.1). HSP27,
  HSP70, and HSP90 can interact with and recruit Apaf-1 (apoptosis protease-activating
  factor 1) by directly sequestering cytochrome C to prevent apoptosome oligomerization
  and activation (C.2). HSP27 can also inhibit apoptosis via inactivation of caspase
  3 and ASK (apoptosis signal-regulated kinase) (C.3). Furthermore, HSP60 and TLR-4
  interactions mediate the NF-kappaB (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway, resulting in the activation
  of caspases 3, 6, and 7 and DNase (C.4). Reprinted (adapted) with permission from
