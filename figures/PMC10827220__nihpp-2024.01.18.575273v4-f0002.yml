figure_title: Analysis of human and mouse datasets show significant enrichment of
  known Ca2+-regulated processes, proteins and pathways.
caption: 'Analysis of human and mouse datasets show significant enrichment of known
  Ca2+-regulated processes, proteins and pathways.(A,B) Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) of CRPs from human (A) and mouse (B) datasets show significant enrichment
  of molecular function terms related to Ca2+ binding and signaling (green text).(C)
  GSEA of proteins with a significant thermal stability change in response to Mg2+
  addition shows an enrichment for DNA, RNA and nucleotide binding molecular functions,
  and lack Ca2+-related processes.(D) Ion-induced thermal stability changes of Annexin
  proteins from human and mouse datasets show a Ca2+-specific response.(E) GSEAof
  human dataset using KEGG annotations enriches Ca2+ signaling.(F) Schematic representation
  of the Ca2+ regulated Gq signaling pathway. Proteins shown were quantified in the
  human lysates. Bolded proteins are identified as CRPs.(G) Ion-induced thermal stability
  changes of Gq pathway proteins, relative to EGTA condition. Dotted lines show log2(FC)
