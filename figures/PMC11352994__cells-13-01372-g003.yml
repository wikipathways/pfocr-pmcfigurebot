figure_title: B7-H4 downregulates the PI3K/Akt/STAT3 signalling pathway in SGHPL-5
  cells.
caption: 'B7-H4 downregulates the PI3K/Akt/STAT3 signalling pathway in SGHPL-5 cells.
  (A) SGHPL-5 cells were incubated with rhB7-H4 at various concentrations for 24 h,
  then the PI3K/Akt/STAT3 signal pathway-related proteins and actin were determined
  by immunoblotting. (B) SGHPL-5 cells were incubated with 0.1 μg/mL rhB7-H4 for 0,
  12, 24, 48 h, and the PI3K/Akt/STAT3 signal pathway-related proteins and actin were
  determined by immunoblotting. (C) Quantitative analysis of (A) to represent p-PI3K/PI3K,
  p-Akt/Akt, p-STAT3/STAT3. (D) Quantitative analysis of (B) to represent p-PI3K/PI3K,
  p-Akt/Akt, p-STAT3/STAT3. Data represent means ± SD of triplicate experiments. Significance:
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus control'
