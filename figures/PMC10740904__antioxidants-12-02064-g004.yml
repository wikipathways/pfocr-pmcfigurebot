caption: Effects of maternal SeY supplementation on the relative protein abundances
  involved in the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway in the duodenum (A), jejunum (B), and
  ileum (C) of suckling offspring piglets. Data are represented as means Â± SEM, n
  = 6 per group, * p < 0.05. CON = control group, sows fed basal diet containing 0.3
  mg/kg Se as Na2SeO3; SeY = SeY group, sows fed basal diet with 0.2 mg/kg Se as Se-enriched
  yeast (Se-yeast with 2000 mg/kg Se)
