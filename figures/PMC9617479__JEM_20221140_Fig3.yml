caption: Cellular metabolism and regulators in ILCs and Th cells. Glucose metabolism
  drives the differentiation of CD4+ Th cells, which is regulated by the mTOR signaling
  pathway. Activated Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells rely on glycolysis and express high
  levels of GLUT1, a critical regulator of glycolysis in Th1 and Th17 cells, predominantly,
  although subset-dependent specificities also exist. While HIF-1α promotes Th17 cell
  polarization, PPAR-γ expression in Th2 cells enhances glycolysis and drives IL-9
  production. In addition, ACC1-mediated de novo FAS is essential for the development
  of Th1 and Th17 cells in intestine as well as the pathogenic Th2 cells with high
  IL-33 expression and IL-5 production in lung and skin. ILC1 metabolism is largely
  unknown. However, NK cells can convert into ILC1-like cells mediated by TGF-β, which
  plays a role in the metabolic activity of cells. Thus, ILC1 metabolism could be
  linked to TGF-β–related metabolic activity changes, such as mTOR signaling and glucose
  and amino acid uptake. ILC2 preferentially metabolize fatty acids (FA) to fuel OXPHOS
  through FAO. Though glycolysis is not mainly utilized by ILC2, the level of glycolysis
  correlates with ILC2 function and is regulated by mTOR signaling, the glycolytic
  enzyme PKM2, and HIF-1α. Different from Th2 cells, the uptake of branched amino
  acids and arginine can also support OXPHOS in ILC2, which is required for ILC2 survival
  and IL-33–induced proliferation. Arg-1 is also a key metabolic checkpoint in ILC2,
  which promotes aerobic glycolysis and ILC2 proinflammatory function. Meanwhile,
  ILC2-derived IL-13 expression is mainly dependent on fatty acid uptake and FAO,
  through the upregulation of PPAR-α and fatty acid transport protein 6 (FATP6). ILC2
  can also uptake external lipids and store them in lipid droplets, mediated by PPAR-γ
  and DGAT1. Like Th17 cells, mTORC1-HIF-1α axis regulates ILC3 proliferation and
  cytokine secretion. Similarly, ACC1 contributes to both ILC3 and Th17 effector function.
  In contrast, the level of mROS production in ILC3s is much higher than the level
  found in Th17 cells. This accumulation of mROS drives ILC3 activation, proliferation,
  and functions. In addition, distinct from Th17 cells, glucose and fatty acid metabolism
  are both upregulated in ILC3 after activation. Furthermore, G-protein-coupled receptor
  (GPCR) expression and L-arginine cytoplasmic levels in ILC3 participate in mTOR
  activation and influence colonic ILC3 proliferation and IL-22 production.
