caption: Non-canonical Wnt/PCP and Wnt Ca2+ signaling and their implications in cancer.
  In Wnt/PCP, overexpression of the Vangl1/2 receptor can have activating effects
  on downstream GTPases and kinases, which ultimately lead to typical cancer characteristics,
  including cell migration, cell invasion, metastasis, and cell proliferation. The
  Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway frequently shows elevated Wnt5a levels in diverse cancer
  cells. Depending on the tissue type, elevated Wnt5a levels can either act as tumor
  suppressive (by inhibiting canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling) or as proto-oncogenic
  (by inducing cell motility, invasiveness, and cancer cell morphology).Black arrows
  indicate a direct influence of a protein on its downstream target. Green arrows
  indicate an increase in activity, while red arrows show a decrease in activity.
