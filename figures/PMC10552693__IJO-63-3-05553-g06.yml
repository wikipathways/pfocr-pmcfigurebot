caption: IGJ regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway in breast cancer. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that IGJ mainly affects the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (B) Western blot analysis detected the key molecules of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (C and D) Overexpression of IGJ inhibited the accumulation of p65 in the
  nuclear of MDA-MB-231 and YCC-B1 cells. IGJ, joining chain of multimeric IgA and
  IgM (JCHAIN); PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen
