caption: 'Overview of JA biosynthesis and signaling pathway in tea plants. In chloroplasts,
  polyunsaturated fatty acids are converted to 12-oxophytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) by
  the sequential activities of several enzymes including lipoxygenase (LOX), allene
  oxide synthase (AOS), and allene oxide cyclase (AOC). 12-OPDA is then transported
  to the peroxisome and reduced by OPDA reductase3 (OPR3) to 3-oxo-2-(2′(Z)-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic
  acid (OPC-8:0); OPC-8:0 undergoes β-oxidation by acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX) to yield
  JA; in the cytosol, JA is converted to JA-Ile by jasmonoyl-isoleucine synthetase
  (JAR1) and MeJA by JA methyltransferase (JMT). JA-Ile is transported to the nucleus
  and perceived by the COI1-JAZ co-receptor complex upon stimulation (high JA-Ile
  levels). Jasmonate ZIM domain proteins (JAZs) are recruited by COI1 and subjected
  to ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. Subsequently,
  bHLH transcription factor (MYC2) can activate the transcription of early JA-responsive
  genes such as those encoding JAZ and MYC2. SCF complex: complex consisting of Skp1,
  Cullin-1, and F-box protein; Ub: ubiquitin. See the explanations in the text. The
  enzymes reported to be involved in JA biosynthesis in the tea plant (blue) are shown'
