caption: Ehmt2-mediated transcriptional regulation during acute pancreatitis is model
  independent. (A) PCA based on DEGs from RNA-seq conducted on pancreas tissue from
  adult Ehmt2 +/+  and Ehmt2 fl/fl  mice with acute pancreatitis for both Pdx1-Cre
  and P48-Cre driven models is shown. Venn diagram illustrates the overlap in significant
  DEGs between pancreatitis-induced Pdx1-Cre and P48-Cre models with Ehmt2 inactivation
  compared to their Ehmt2 +/+  counterparts for (B) upregulated and (C) downregulated
  genes. (D) Heatmap displays the average expression of DEGs that were significant
  in at least one condition for Ehmt2 +/+  and Ehmt2 fl/fl  animals treated with caerulein
  in both Pdx1-Cre and P48-Cre models. (E) MSigDB Hallmarks pathway enrichment analysis
  is shown for significant DEGs between caerulein-treated Pdx1-Cre and P48-Cre models
  in both Ehmt2 +/+  and Ehmt2 fl/fl  animals for both upregulated and downregulated
  genes.
