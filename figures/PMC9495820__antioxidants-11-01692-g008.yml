caption: 'FPR2 signaling triggers metabolic reprogramming of lung cancer cells. FPR2
  stimulation increases the ribose 5-phosphate (Ribose-5P) concentration and stim-ulates
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), thus promoting NADPH generation. WKYMVm and
  ANXA1 binding to FPR2 also induce enhanced transketolase (TKT) ac-tivity in the
  non-oxidative phase of the PPP and increases in the citrate and malate concentrations.
  In the cytosol, citrate can be converted in acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, and the
  latter can be converted into malate through malate dehydrogenase (MDH). Malate may
  contribute to NADPH generation through a reaction catalyzed by the malic enzyme
  (ME). FPR2 signaling induces an increase in the expression of the gluta-mine transporter
  ASCT2 and enhances the concentration of aspartate and glutamine, the pyrimidine
  nucleotide biosynthesis precursors. CAD, the multifunctional enzyme that participates
  in the three initial speed-limiting steps of de novo pyrimidine nucleo-tide synthesis,
  is phosphorylated at the Ser1859 residue in a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner upon
  the binding of WKYMVm and ANXA1 to the receptor. Therefore, the FPR2-mediated activation
  of CAD and enhanced concentrations of Ribose-5P, aspar-tate, and glutamine contribute
  to an increased de novo biosynthesis of nucleotides. Glutamine can be converted
  into glutamate by glutaminase (GLS). Glutamate can be converted into oxoalacetate
  and fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) that, in turn, increases the mitochondrial
  membrane potential. ME: Malic enzyme; MDH: Malate dehydrogenase; TKT: Transketolase;
  TALD: Transaldolase; GLS: Glutaminase; CAD: Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate
