caption: Relationships between modules and traits revealed by WGCNA. (A) The relationships
  between modules and traits of mutations, tissues, and developmental stages. Module
  names are listed on the left and traits at the bottom. In the table, data are presented
  as correlation coefficients with p-values in brackets. (B) distribution of genes
  involved in APC-related ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and plant hormone signal
  transduction pathways among different WGCNA modules. APC, GA, auxin, BR, and CK
  represent the APC-related ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, gibberellin, auxin, brassinosteroid,
  and cytokinin pathways, respectively
