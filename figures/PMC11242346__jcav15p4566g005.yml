caption: The effect of JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480 on OTUB1 silencing in GBM cells. (A)
  Levels of expression of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT1, and STAT1 in GBM cells cultured with
  AZD1480 assessed using Western blot. (B) The effect of the JAK2/STAT1 pathway on
  the viability of OTUB1-silenced GBM cells assessed using the CCK-8 assay. (C-D)
  The role of the JAK2/STAT1 pathway on cell cycle and apoptosis of OTUB1-silenced
  GBM cells using flow cytometry. (E) BAX, Bcl-2, and cyclin D1 expression levels
  in GBM cells cultured with AZD1480 detected using Western blot. *p<0.05, **p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. Bcl2, B-cell lymphoma 2; BAX, pro-apoptotic factor Bcl-2-associated
  X protein; GBM, glioblastoma; Janus kinase, JAK; p-JAK, phosphorylated JAK; STAT,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription; phosphorylated, p-STAT
