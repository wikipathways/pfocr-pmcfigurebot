  may reduce total peripheral resistance by dilating skeletal muscle resistance vessels
  through β2-adrenergic receptors and might decrease arterial wall shear stress by
  lowering heart rate through β1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. This drug could also
  reduce vascular oxidative stress at the arterial wall level by stimulating nitric
  oxide production. Lastly, it might increase arterial stiffness by enhancing TGFβ-mediated
  pro-fibrotic mechanisms and promoting collagen synthesis via β1 antagonism and β2
  stimulation, respectively. By acting on angiotensin receptors, sartans could provide
  vascular protection either by inducing vasodilation or by limiting the adverse effects
  of angiotensin II on vascular remodeling. Targeting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
  via doxycycline might counteract collagen degradation, thereby increasing its content
  in the arterial wall and enhancing vessel stiffness. Inhibition of phospholipase
  C/inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate/protein kinase C/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (PLC/IP3/PKC/ERK) has been shown to prevent spontaneous fatal aortic rupture in
  a mouse model. Antiandrogen medications may also contribute by interfering with
  this signaling pathway. Future research should identify drugs capable of improving
  mechanisms of autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, and stress response,
  which are likely to contribute substantially in the natural history of vEDS. Red
