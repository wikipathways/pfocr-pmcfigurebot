figure_title: 'Move Your Body toward Healthy Aging: Potential Neuroprotective Mechanisms
  of Irisin in Alzheimer’s Disease'
caption: Irisin is a hormone produced in response to physical activity that has potential
  to treat Alzheimer’s disease by regulating synaptic function, modulating autophagy,
  inhibiting cell death pathways, and mitigating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation
  to promote neuroprotection and slow the progression of dementia
