figure_title: Graph representing the interaction networks of selected genes.
caption: 'Graph representing the interaction networks of selected genes. The GeneMANIA
  network indicates the direct interaction between the methylation complex genes and
  molecules involved in metabolism during the progression of EC [4]. The in silico
  analysis revealed that TRIM28 (blue circles) and DNMT1 (orange, dashed circles)
  interacted with genes engaged in central carbon metabolism in cancer (hsa05230)
  [4], limited to Homo sapiens (https://genemania.org/) [24]. The colors of the line
  suggest the type of interaction, that is, red—physical interactions; purple—co-expression;
  orange—predicted; blue—co-localization; light blue—pathway; green—genetic interactions;
  olive—shared protein domains. Selected genes are represented by circles with stripes.
