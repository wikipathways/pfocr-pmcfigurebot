  Hippo signaling pathway.
caption: PTCSC3 suppresses viability and promotes apoptosis of TNBC cell through Hippo
  signaling pathway. Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of PTCSC3 led
  to increased p-YAP/YAP and p-LATS1/LATS1, while overexpression of MIR100HG led to
  decreased p-YAP/YAP and p-LATS1/LATS1 levels in TNBC (A) BT-549 and (C) HCC70 cells.
  In addition, rescue experiments showed that overexpression of MIR100HG attenuated
  the effects of PTCSC3 overexpression on protein levels. Cell nucleus/cytoplasm fractionation
  and western blotting analysis were conducted to demonstrate the YAP translocation
  in (B) BT-549 and (D) HCC70 cells. Immunofluorescence assays showed the localization
  of YAP in TNBC cells after overexpression with PTCSC3 or MIR100HG in (E) BT-549
  and (F) HCC70 cells. Scale bars, 30 µm (**P<0.01; *P<0.05). TNBC, triple-negative
  breast cancer; p-, phosphorylated-; YAP, Yes-associated protein; C, control; NC,
  negative control
