caption: SVHRSP can inhibit the SIRT1/P53 signaling pathway, leading to enhanced nuclear
  translocation of NRF-2 and subsequently promoting the expression of antioxidants
  in SAMP8 mice. (A) Representative WB bands. (B,C) Quantitative analysis of SIRT1
  and P53 in vivo. (D) Representative WB bands. (E,F) Quantitative analysis of SIRT1
  and P53 in vitro. (G–J) Representative WB bands and quantification analysis of nuclear
  NRF2 and cytoplasmic NRF2. (K,L) Immunofluorescence images and quantification analysis
  of NRF2 cells/total cells (scale bar = 10 μm). (M) Representative WB bands. (N,O)
  Quantitative analysis of SOD 1 and HO-1 in vivo. (P–R) mRNA quantitative analysis
  of SOD 1, Hmox-1, and NQO1 in vivo. (S–W) Representative WB bands and quantitative
  analysis of SOD 1, HO-1, and NQO 1 in vitro. The bars represent the mean ± SD. ns
  = not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus the indicated groups
  (n = 3 for each group)
