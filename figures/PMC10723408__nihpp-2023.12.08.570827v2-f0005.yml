figure_title: Analysis of enzyme demand and relative cost distribution in the sphingolipid
  biosynthesis pathway
caption: (A) Distribution of relative enzyme costs, showcasing the energy and resource
  allocation within the metabolic network normalized to the SPT limiting enzyme. The
  analysis reveals significantly low activity levels of CS1 (LOH2), and GCS enzymes,
  indicating tight regulation in response to substrate availability and metabolic
  demands. The relative enzyme activity levels, in relation to the first and rate-limiting
  step catalyzed by SPT, suggest key roles for specific enzymes in maintaining pathway
  homeostasis and reaction rates. (B) Enzyme specificity investigation, representing
  the demand of each enzyme concerning each reactive sphingolipid species, highlighting
  the interplay of enzymes with various lipid species, and revealing potential regulatory
  hotspots. The figure highlights the variability in enzyme cost specificity, with
  notably high demands for FA2Hd and FA2Hh, enzymes involved in the conversion of
  t18:0-C16 and t18:1-C24 to their respective analogous hydroxyceramides (hCers),
  underscoring the pivotal role of FA2H in meeting the metabolic demands of t18:0/t18:1-hC24
