figure_title: GO and KEGG functional annotation analyses of the differentially expressed
  genes.
caption: GO and KEGG functional annotation analyses of the differentially expressed
  genes. The horizontal coordinate indicates the secondary classification term for
  GO, the vertical coordinate indicates the number of genes in that secondary classification
  of the ratio, and the three colors indicate the three major classifications (a).
  The horizontal coordinate represents the name of the KEGG metabolic pathway, the
  vertical coordinate represents the number of genes annotated to the pathway, and
  the seven categories of KEGG metabolic pathways are shown in different colors (b)
