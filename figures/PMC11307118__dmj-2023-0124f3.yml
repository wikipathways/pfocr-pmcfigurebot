figure_title: Differentially expressed genes in asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1)
  knockout cells were enriched in the insulin signal pathway.
caption: Differentially expressed genes in asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) knockout
  cells were enriched in the insulin signal pathway. (A) Heatmap shows hierarchical
  clustering of Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient based on sequencing. The score of
  1 (red) denotes perfect correlation. (B) Heatmap shows hierarchical clustering of
  significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ASGR1-/- HepG2 cells compared
  to the HepG2 cells. Values are column-scaled to show expression level. (C) Gene
  Ontology (GO) analysis identified molecular functions and biological processes of
  significant DEGs. (D) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis
  of significant DEGs. The enrichment score indicates the degree of enrichment of
  DEGs in the biological process or pathway. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT,
  protein kinase B; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor
