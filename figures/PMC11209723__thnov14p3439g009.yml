caption: Therapeutic effects and molecular mechanism of MPS-based individualized treatment
  in the established human NB cells models. (A) and (B), cell wound healing assays
  evaluated the migration ability of NB cells after treatment. (C) and (D), flow cytometry
  revealed the pro-apoptotic effects of MPS-based individualized treatment on their
  respective sensitive NB subgroup. (E) and (F), TUNEL assays confirmed the pro-apoptotic
  effects of MPS-based individualized treatment against MPS-stratified NB cells. (G)
  and (H), reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential of MPS-I and MPS-II NB cells
  after individualized treatment. (I) and (J), western blotting results demonstrated
  that the key pro-apoptotic proteins involved in mitochondrial pathway were upregulated,
  while the anti-apoptotic protein was down-regulated, in the treated MPS-I and MPS-II
  cells. Scale bars of (G) are 25μm, and others are 50μm.
