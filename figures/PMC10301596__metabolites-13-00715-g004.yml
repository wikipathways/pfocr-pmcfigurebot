caption: The KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment analyses were performed to compare
  the maternal urine metabolomes of the PE and non-PE cohorts. The resulting plot
  displays the âˆ’log10(p-value) of metabolic pathways on the vertical axis (y-axis),
  while the corresponding pathway enrichment is shown on the horizontal axis (x-axis).
  Pathways that achieved a p-value of <0.05 are highlighted as red circles
