caption: CDEs induce CREPT expression through ERK activation. (A) The luciferase reporter
  activity in CHO cells transfected with a luciferase gene driven by CREPT-promoter
  and treated with PBS, 4T1EXO or 231EXO. (B) KEGG analysis of the 195 differentially
  upregulated proteins (p-value < 0.05) in 231EXO compared with MCF10AEXO. The -Log10(p-value)
  is indicated. (C) The heatmap of relative levels of 14 proteins associated with
  RAP1 signaling pathway enriched in 231EXO. (D) Western blot of p-ERK, ERK, p-p38,
  p38 and CREPT in the protein extracts of MCF10A cells treated with PBS or 231EXO,
  and in protein extracts of NMuMG cells treated with PBS or 4T1EXO. The statistics
  analysis of p-ERK and p-p38 levels was present (E-F), n = 3. (G) Western blot of
  CREPT in protein extracts of MCF10A cells or NMuMG cells treated with PBS plus DMSO
  or treated with 231EXO plus DMSO, JNK inhibitor (SP600125, 10 µM), ERK inhibitor
  (SCH772984, 5 µM) or p38 inhibitor (SB203580, 10 µM). All inhibitors were dissolved
  in DMSO as the solvent. The statistics analysis of CREPT protein levels was present
  (H), n = 3. (I) The luciferase reporter activity in 293T cells transfected with
  the plasmid carrying a luciferase gene driven by CREPT-promoter plus the vector
  of pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1/flag-ELK1 treated with PBS or 231EXO
