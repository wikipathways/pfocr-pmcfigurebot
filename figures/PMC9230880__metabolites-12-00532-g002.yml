caption: Pathway map showing a selection of key metabolites analyzed by µCE-HRMS that
  track HGSC progression. Metabolites targeted in this study are shown as solid symbols
  and intermediates connecting the pathways are shown in grey text. Time-resolved
  serum metabolic trajectories for TKO mice are shown for select metabolites. For
  time-resolved plots, the x-axis shows the % lifetime, calculated as the ratio of
  the age of the mouse at a given serum sampling time point compared to the total
  lifespan of that specific animal. The y-axis shows the fold change calculated as
  the base 2 logarithm of the abundance in TKO/TKO control samples. Positive values
  indicate higher serum levels in TKO animals and negative values indicate lower serum
  levels in TKO animals compared to TKO controls. Error bars represent the standard
  error of the log2 fold change between TKO and control samples.
