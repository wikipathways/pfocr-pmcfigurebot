caption: Schematic illustration of the interaction between the PERK/ATF4 branch of
  endoplasmic reticulum stress response and mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism after
  ICH. ICH causes the accumulation of toxic byproducts in neurons, resulting in the
  accumulation of unfolded proteins and the subsequent initiation of the ERS. In response
  to these stresses, an adaptive response occurs through the PERK/ATF4 signaling pathway
  by increasing 1C metabolism to maintain cellular homeostasis. However, if the adaptive
  response is insufficient to alleviate ERS, ATF4 activates the CHOP apoptotic pathway.
  Furthermore, MTHFD2 may play a role in stabilizing GRP78 within the ER, forming
  a negative regulatory loop with the GRP78/PERK/ATF4 axis to maintain ER homeostasis.
  After ICH, interventions such as PERK blockade and exogenous NADPH supplementation
  may mitigate neuronal apoptosis
