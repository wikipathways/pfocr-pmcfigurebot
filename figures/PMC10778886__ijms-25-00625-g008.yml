caption: (A) Fragment of the scheme of molecular interactions during influenza A virus
  infection involved in the regulation of Jak-STAT signaling pathway. (B) Relative
  expression of genes involved in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway in influenza A infected
  WI-38 VA-13 cells at 24 h after influenza A virus infection, according to results
  of our transcriptomic analysis. Log2 fold change (LogFC) values were generated for
  transcriptome sequencing samples by comparing the average RPKM values of genes at
  24 of infection vs. uninfected cells. (C) Expression of genes involved in the Jak-STAT
  signaling pathway in original WI-38 VA13 cells and clones with mutations (F3, F5,
  E12) before infection (0 hpi) and at 24 h (24 hpi) after influenza A virus infection.
  The normalized counts of mapped reads averaged for two biological repeats are shown
