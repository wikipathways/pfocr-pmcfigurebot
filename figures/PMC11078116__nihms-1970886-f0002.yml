figure_title: Characterization of gene proliferation phenotypes
caption: '(A) Left: principal-component analysis (PCA) of all gene disruptions, with
  a 2D density overlay illustrating the distribution of proliferation-decreasing (blue),
  neutral (gray), and proliferation-increasing (green) phenotypes and individual gene
  disruptions (orange) with biological roles in the maintenance of NSCs or human neurodevelopment;
  see text for details. Right: temporal dynamics captured by PCA shown at 4, 8, and
  12 cell divisions.(B) Top: histogram of proliferation scores obtained from PCA for
  gene disruptions (black) and genomic background controls (gray). Bottom: partitioning
  of all gene disruptions that decrease proliferation into severe (top 25%) and strong
  (top 50%) categories.(C) Fold enrichment of GO biological processes and risk gene
  sets within the partitions shown in (B). n.s., not significant. Hypergeometric BH-corrected
  p values are as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005.(D) FGF signaling
  pathway (Reactome: R-HSA-1226099); see text for details. Genes disrupted within
  this pathway are shown in black, and a significant subset (BH-corrected p = 2.8
  × 10−2) results in proliferation phenotypes (red)'
