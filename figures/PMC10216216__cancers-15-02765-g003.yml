caption: (a) Dedifferentiation induction of CD44-CD24+ tumour cells of T47D and Bt-474
  lines without cisplatin exposure; arrows show mammospheres. (b) Cellularity changes
  dynamics of CD44-CD24+ T47D and Bt-474 cell cultures without chemo exposure; on
  the abscissa—time, days. (c) Differential-expressing WNT signalling pathway genes
  at 21 days incubation in CD44-CD24+ cells and wild type cells; red—CD44-CD24+ expression
  is higher than in wild type cells, green—vice versa
