caption: QUE alleviates the effect of ZEA in combination with LPS on the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway in IPEC-J2 cells. (A–D) Relative gene levels of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, and SOD2.
  (E–H) Relative protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1. The data are presented with
  mean ± SD (n = 3). Different letters indicate p < 0.05
