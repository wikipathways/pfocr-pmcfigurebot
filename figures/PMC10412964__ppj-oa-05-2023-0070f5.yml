figure_title: The metabolic pathway comparison of bacterial microbiota.
caption: The metabolic pathway comparison of bacterial microbiota. The figure shows
  the pathways that are more prevalent in the healthy apple tree twig endosphere.
  The pink-red bars represent the results from previous studies on the twig endosphere
  of healthy and unhealthy apple trees, while the cyan bars represent the results
  from our study on nine regions of the twig endosphere. The vertical axis values
  indicate the gene owned by the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) index (GOO [Gene
  Owned by OTUs] index), which is calculated by multiplying the relative abundance
  by the gene counts related to the pathway of each ASV. Each GOO index is evaluated
  using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, as depicted in the top left of the panel.
  The small letter above the bars depicts the Conover-Iman test
