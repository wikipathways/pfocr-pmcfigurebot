caption: 'Pin1 deficiency alleviates MCD diet-induced NAFLD progression. (A) Knockout
  of Pin1 improved MCD-induced lipid levels and liver function impairment in mouse
  serum (* p < 0.05, #p < 0.05). (B) Western blot detection and quantification of
  AMPK/ACC1 pathway protein expression in liver tissues of mice induced by MCD diet.
  (C) RT-qPCR was used to detect mRNA levels of related genes in AMPK/ACC1 pathway
  in liver tissue of mice induced by MCD diet (* indicates compared with WT-ND group,
  p < 0.05; ** indicates p < 0.01 compared with WT-ND group; # indicates p < 0.05
  compared with WT-MCD group; ## indicates p < 0.01 compared with WT-MCD group). (D)
  Immunohistochemical detection of p-ACC1, ACC1 and p-AMPK, AMPK protein expression
  levels in mouse liver tissues (200Ã—). (E) Immunohistochemical protein expression
  quantification plots (** indicates p < 0.01 compared with the WT-ND group; # indicates
  p < 0.05 compared with the WT-MCD group; ## indicates p < 0.01 compared with the
  WT-MCD group)'
