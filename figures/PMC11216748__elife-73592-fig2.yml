figure_title: VEGFA-FLT1-AKT1 axis controls apoptosis in MuSC in vitro
caption: (A) Experimental scheme for assessing apoptosis following thapsigargin induction
  in myoblast culture. (B) Decreased cell survival in myoblast in vitro as VEGFA is
  blocked using 100 ng/ml FLT1-FC (a VEFGA trap) following thapsigargin induction.
  This phenotype is partially rescued with exogenous VEGFA (50 ng/ml). Data show mean
  ± SD (n=3). (C) Graphical representation of the various tools used to interrogate
  the VEGFA pathway in this figure. This panel created with BioRender.com, and published
  using a TQ26O8B2M7 license with permission. (D) Following thapsigargin induction,
  apoptotic and necrotic cells are increased with inhibition of FLT1 via FLT1-FC or
  anti-FLT1 antibody (anti-FLT1 mAb) but not FLK1 (SU5402 and ZM306416) or NRP1-FLK1
  inhibition (EG00229) following exogenous VEGFA (50 ng/ml). Data show mean ± SD (n=3).
  (E) 4-OHT induced deletion of Flt1 in Pax7+/CreER:Flt1Loxp/Loxp myoblasts is sufficient
  to reduce cell survival in myoblast without induction of apoptosis. Data show mean
  ± SD (n=3). (F) Cell survival is decreased in vitro in myoblast with thapsigargin
  induction following 4-OHT mediated deletion of Flt1 in Pax7+/CreER:Flt1Loxp/Loxp
  myoblast that is not rescued by exogenous VEGFA. Blue indicates MuSC-Flt1+/+, red
  indicates MuSC-Flt1+/+ with 50 ng/ml VEGFA, green indicates MuSC-Flt1Δ/Δ and purple
  indicates MuSC-Flt1Δ/Δ with 50 ng/ml VEGFA. Data show mean ± SD (n=3). (G) Representative
  images of pAKT1 (red) in myoblast stained by MyoD (green) in MuSC-Flt1+/+ and MuSC-Flt1Δ/Δ
  myoblasts induced with exogenous VEGFA. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).
  Scale bar indicates 50 µm. (H) Quantification of pAKT1 in myoblasts stained by MyoD
  in MuSC-Flt1+/+ and MuSC-Flt1Δ/Δ myoblast induced w/wo exogenous VEGFA. VEGFA induction
  increases pAKT1 in MuSC-Flt1+/+ myoblasts but this response is lost in MuSC-Flt1Δ/Δ
  myoblasts. Data show mean ± SD (n=3). (I) Annexin V quantification of myoblasts
  transfected with myr-AKT1 and E4ORF1 to activate AKT1 showed increased cell survival
  of myoblasts following thapsigargin induction. Data show mean ± SD (n=3). (J) Representative
  model for VEGFA-FLT1-AKT1 axis-mediated MuSC survival. This panel created with BioRender.com,
  and published using a TQ26O8B2M7 license with permission. Figure 2—source data 1.Measurement
