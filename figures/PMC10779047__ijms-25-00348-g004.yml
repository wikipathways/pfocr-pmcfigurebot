caption: Screening and functional enrichment analysis of differential PANoptosis genes.
  (A) The upset plot shows the overlap between PANoptosis gene list and the same trend
  genes in the two training sets. (B) Heatmap representation of log2(Foldchange) of
  DEPGs in the two training sets. (C) GO functional enrichment analysis, including
  BP, CC, and MF, revealed the underlying functions of DEPGs. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment
  revealed the top 25 pathways enriched in DEPGs. (E) Reactome pathway analysis of
  the DEPGs
