figure_title: Neoplastic vs Hyperplastic growths exhibit different signaling pathway
  activity
caption: 'A) A basal hyperplastic protrusion (arrow) with a neoplastic-like mass at
  the tip (arrowhead) positive for MMP1. B,C) Accessory glands overexpressing RasV12
  in GFP-labeled cells exhibit di-phosphorylated MAPK (DP-MapK) and phosphorylated
  AKT (pAKT) in the absence of hyperplasia or neoplasia at ten days. Sample size:
  N = 6 DP-MapK, N=2 pAKT. D) Oncogenic expression leads to increased MMP1 in 20d
  samples. Sample size: Control N=12, Myc+E2f, DP N=12, Yki*+E2f, Dp N= 13. E) Oncogenic
  expression leads to increased phospho-4EBP (p4EBP) in 10 d samples. Sample sizes:
  Control N=12, Myc+E2f, DP N=8, Yki*+E2f, Dp N= 10. F,G,H) Neoplastic-like masses
  (arrowheads) are positive for DP-MAPK (F) and P-AKT, while hyperplastic growths
  (arrows) are not (G,H) at 20d. Sample size: N= 14'
