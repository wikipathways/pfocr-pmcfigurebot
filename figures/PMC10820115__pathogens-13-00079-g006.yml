caption: 'Trypanothione biosynthetic pathway and redox balance in trypanosomatids.
  Reduced trypanothione is a complex formed by two molecules of reduced glutathione
  bridged by their glycine residues with spermidine. Trypanothione can be oxidized
  by ROS to the oxidized form, establishing a sulfur redox balance enzymatically controlled
  by trypanothione reductase. The singularity of this ROS scavenger in trypanosomatids
  is an interesting druggable target for drug intervention in trypanosomatids. Abbreviations
  of the enzymes and transporters and their corresponding EC numbers are given in
  alphabetic order: γGCS, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (EC 6.3.2.2); GS, glutathione
  synthase (EC 6.3.2.3); GSS, glutathionyl spermidine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.8); TryR,
  trypanothione reductase (EC 1.8.1.12); TryS, trypanothione synthase (EC 6.3.1.9).
  Abbreviations for the metabolites are also given in alphabetic order: γGC, γ-glutamylcysteine;
  Gsp, glutathionylspermidine; GSH, reduced glutathione; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  T(SH)2, reduced trypanothione; TS2, oxidized trypanothione'
