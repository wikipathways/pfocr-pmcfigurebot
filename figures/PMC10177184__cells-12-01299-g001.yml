figure_title: Rank pairwise correlation between 11 gene evolutionary rate metrics
  related to NGRE and dN/dS.
caption: 'Rank pairwise correlation between 11 gene evolutionary rate metrics related
  to NGRE and dN/dS. (A) Correlations calculated using 10,890 gene profiles. (B) Correlations
  calculated using 710 gene profiles for six major cancer-related pathways. Upper
  matrix triangle and main diagonal are colored by rank correlation value, and asterisks
  denote p-value: * stands for p < 0.05 and *** for p < 0.001. Lower matrix triangle
  contains rank correlation coefficients in numeric format. The clustering method
  is Ward.D2 [43]'
