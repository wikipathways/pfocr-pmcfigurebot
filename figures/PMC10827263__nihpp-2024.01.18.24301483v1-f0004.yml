figure_title: Ruxolitinib ameliorates dysregulated and neuroinflammatory gene expression
  during murine CM-PIIRS
caption: Gene transcripts of brain homogenates from naïve, untreated/infected, and
  ruxolitinib-treated/infected mice at 21 dpi were analyzed using a NanoString multiplex
  neuroinflammation panel. a Principal-component analysis (PCA) of normalized read
  counts of the total of 757 transcripts associated with neuroinflammation. Untreated/Infected
  and ruxolitinib-treated/infected mice formed separate clusters with principal components
  1 and 2. Data from NanoString shown are from one experiment with n=4 mice per group.
  b Ruxolitinib treatment ameliorates all neuroinflammation pathway scores altered
  by CM-PIIRS in mice. In particular, adaptive immune response and cytokine signaling.
  c Volcano plot of NanoString gene expression analysis comparing brain homogenates
  from naive or ruxolitinib-treated/infected mice versus untreated/infected mice (N=4
  mice per group). Highlighted in orange are differentially expressed genes (DEGs;
  Log2 fold change (FC)<−1 and adjusted p-value<0.01) belonging to the adaptive immune
  response pathway (top) or cytokine signaling pathway (bottom). d Pathway analysis
  using DEG between untreated/infected mice and other groups was performed using IPA
