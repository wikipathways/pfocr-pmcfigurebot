caption: Binding of EPO to EPOR induces JAK-2 phosphorylation, dimerization, and subsequently
  activate STAT5/3, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3-K/Akt, and NF-κB pathways. JAK-2 phosphorylates
  STAT5 or STAT3, leading to the dimerization of STAT5 (STAT3). STAT5 (STAT3) and
  the last signaling molecule in the MAPK pathway translocate into the nucleus and
  upregulate the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Activation of PI3-k/Akt
  pathway increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and
  NO production, which could increase blood flow and attenuate regional injury. PI3-k/Akt
  pathway also phosphorylates transcription factor GATA-1 and Foxo3 A, which enhance
  the expression of antiapoptosis proteins. Activation of the IKK complex by Akt phosphorylates
  IκB, resulting in its ubiquitination, and degradation, and in the releases of bound
  NF-κB. Free NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and exerts its antiapoptosis activity
  through the expression of inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAPs). Furthermore,
  binding of EPO to EPOR/βcR activates Wnt signaling, which inhibits GSK-3β phosphorylation
  and allow β-catenin to stabilize and accumulate in the cytoplasm in a non-phosphorylated
  form. Free β-catenin translocates into the nucleus and trigger transcription of
  Wnt-target gene responsible for cell antiapoptosis and the development of nervous
  system. Activation of NMDA receptors allows the influx of Ca2+, which induces excitotoxicity
  via initiation of the μ-calpain/Bax/cytochrome c/caspase-9 pathway. The caspases
  result in DNA fragmentation and lead to cell apoptosis. Activation of PI3-K/Akt
  pathway could also inhibit caspase activity by preventing cytochrome c leakage from
  mitochondria, thus inhibiting DNA degradation.
