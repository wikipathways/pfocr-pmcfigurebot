caption: 'Comparative analysis of differentially methylated regions and differentially
  expressed genes in the metabolism pathways related to sink-source regulation. (A)
  auxin; (B) ethylene; (C) brassinolide (BR) biosynthesis and metabolism pathways.
  AUX1, auxin influx carrier (AUX1 LAX family); IAA, auxin−responsive protein IAA;
  ARF, auxin response factor; SAUR, SAUR family protein; GH3, auxin−responsive GH3
  gene family; ERF1, ethylene−responsive transcription factor 1; ETR, ethylene receptor
  [EC:2.7.13.−]; EBF1/2, EIN3−binding F−box protein; SIMKK, mitogen−activated protein
  kinase 4/5 [EC:2.7.12.2]; BRI1, protein brassinosteroid insensitive 1 [EC:2.7.10.1
  2.7.11.1]; BSK, BR-signalling kinase [EC:2.7.11.1]; BAK1, brassinosteroid insensitive
  1−associated receptor kinase 1 [EC:2.7.10.1, 2.7.11.1]; BZR1/2, brassinosteroid
  resistant 1/2; CYCD3, cyclin D3, plant; TCH4, xyloglucan: xyloglucosyl transferase
  TCH4 [EC:2.4.1.207]. (D) Sucrose metabolism pathway. SUS, sucrose synthase [EC:2.4.1.13];
  INV, beta−fructofuranosidase [EC:3.2.1.26]; TPS, trehalose 6−phosphate synthase
  [EC:2.4.1.15; 2.4.1.347]; TPP, trehalose 6−phosphate phosphatase [EC:3.1.3.12].
  (E) RFO synthesis pathway. GALE, UDP−glucose 4−epimerase [EC:5.1.3.2]; SPS, sucrose−phosphate
  synthase [EC:2.4.1.14]; SPP, sucrose phosphate phosphatase [EC:3.1.3.24]; GolS,
  galactinol synthase [EC:2.4.1.123]; RS, Raffinose synthase [EC:2.4.1.82]; STS, stachyose
  synthetase [EC:2.4.1.67]. Green boxes denote that the gene is modified by a DMR.
  The heatmap shows the expression levels of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  in NFNLs and FNLs in RNA−seq. Log2 (FNL/NFNL) represents the gene fold-change, where
  FNL/NFNL refers to the ratio of FPKM reads'
