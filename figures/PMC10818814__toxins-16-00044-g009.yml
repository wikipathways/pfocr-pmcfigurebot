figure_title: KEGG enrichment analysis of differential genes between the ZEA group
  and A2+ZEA group.
caption: 'KEGG enrichment analysis of differential genes between the ZEA group and
  A2+ZEA group. Note: The left coordinate indicates the specific name of the KEGG
  metabolic pathway, while the right coordinate represents the primary classification
  name related to the pathway. The horizontal coordinate denotes the number of genes
  annotated under this pathway and its proportion to the total number of annotated
  genes'
