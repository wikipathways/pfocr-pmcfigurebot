caption: IGJ affects the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer by regulating
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. A one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc test Tukey's
  test was used for comparisons between groups (*P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001).
  (A) Transwell assay indicated a decreased ability of IGJ to inhibit the invasion
  and metastasis of breast cancer cells following the addition of LPS. (B and C) CCK-8
  assay indicated that following the addition of LPS, IGJ inhibited the proliferation
  of breast cancer cells. (D and E) IGJ regulated the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  process mainly through the NF-κB signaling pathway. IGJ, joining chain of multimeric
  IgA and IgM (JCHAIN); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase
