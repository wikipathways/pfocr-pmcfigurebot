figure_title: PDCD4 knockdown mitigates KA-induced neurotoxicity of HT22 cells by
  blocking the MAPK/NF-κB pathway.
caption: 'PDCD4 knockdown mitigates KA-induced neurotoxicity of HT22 cells by blocking
  the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. (A) Levels of LDH in KA-induced HT22 cells transfected with
  sh-PDCD4 with or without PMA treatment were detected using an LDH assay. (B) Apoptosis
  was detected by flow cytometry. (C) Levels of caspase 3 were measured using the
  corresponding kit. (D) Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the expression
  levels of apoptosis-related proteins. Data are presented as the means ± SD. ***P<0.001
  vs. Control; ###P<0.001 vs. KA + sh-NC; $$$P<0.001 vs. KA + sh-PDCD4. KA, kainic
  acid; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NC, negative control; PARP, poly (ADP-ribose)
  polymerase; PDCD4, human programmed cell death 4; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate;
  sh, short hairpin'
