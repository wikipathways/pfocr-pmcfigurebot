figure_title: Mfn2 overexpression does not alter glutamine oxidation or reductive
  carboxylation in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells.
caption: Mfn2 overexpression does not alter glutamine oxidation or reductive carboxylation
  in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. An overview of the TCA cycle and linked
  glutaminolysis metabolic pathway (green arrow indicates reductive carboxylation
  pathway) (A). The levels of TCA cycle and TCA cycle-related metabolites, including
  glutamate, α-ketoglutarate, isocitrate, citrate, succinate, malate, oxaloacetate,
  and aspartate, were unchanged upon Mfn2 overexpression (B–I). Mfn2 overexpression
  did not affect the levels of GLUD (J), ACO2 (K), IDH2 (L), and OGDH (M). Data are
  mean ± SEM; n = 4
