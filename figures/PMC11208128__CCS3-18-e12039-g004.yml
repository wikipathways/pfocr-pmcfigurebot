caption: The complexity and interconnected nature of crucial signaling pathways that
  mediate signals either promoting or counteracting obesity. There are numerous pathways
  involved in promoting or counteracting obesity, which impact appetite, thermogenesis,
  lipolysis, adipose tissue metabolism, glucose and fat homeostasis, adipogenesis,
  and energy expenditure. Key pathways include MAPKs, PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, TGF‐β, AMPK,
  and Wnt/β‐catenin. These pathways are interconnected and can have both stimulating
  and inhibiting effects. For example, the AMPK pathway directly affects lipolysis
  while also promoting insulin resistance and inflammation in adipose tissue. Another
  example is the JAK/STAT pathway, which has anti‐obesity effects by impacting thermogenesis,
  lipolysis, and hypophagia, while also promoting the pathogenesis of obesity by impacting
  adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. The various activities and interconnection
  of the pathways depicted make it highly difficult to develop suitable drugs. This
  figure has been redrawn in a modified form from the work of Wen and colleagues.
