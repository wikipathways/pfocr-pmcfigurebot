caption: Lung cancer differentially expressed gene enrichment analysis and PPI network
  analysis of 13 dark biomarker genes. (a) The left side of the figure displays the
  top ten pathways from the KEGG enrichment analysis results. Specifically, we selected
  54 genes in the TNF signaling pathway. (b) On the right side, the proteinâ€“protein
  interaction (PPI) analyses yield results indicating that seven dark biomarkers have
  node interactions with lung cancer significant difference genes
