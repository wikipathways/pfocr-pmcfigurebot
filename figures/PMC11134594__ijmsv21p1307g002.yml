caption: 'The TGF-β signaling pathway: Integrins release TGF-β by binding to LLC on
  ECM. TGF-β activates receptor-regulated Smad (Smad2/3) by recruiting the receptor(TβRI/II)
  and then binds to co-mediator Smad (Smad4) to activate the expression of target
  genes, while inhibitory Smad (Smad6/7) inhibits this process. TGF-β can also activate
  different signaling pathways to participate in the signaling pathway modification,
  including the PI3K/AKT pathway, the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and the Erk1/2 pathway.
  Additionally, non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs, MicroRNAs, and CircRNAs) can also participate
  in the TGF-β signaling pathway by regulating the expression of TGF-β transcription
  factors'
