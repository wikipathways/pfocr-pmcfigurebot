caption: Comparing similarities and differences between the five identifiable structures
  of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) in a table-like Figure. 1. Lacunes (a footprint
  of stroke); 2. enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) (a biomarker of glymphatic (GLY)
  system pathway dysfunction (dys)); 3. white matter hyperintensities (WMH) (footprint
  of ischemia); 4. cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) (biomarkers of SVD/stroke with hemorrhage
  or ischemic infarct); 5. recent small subcortical infarcts (historical or MRI findings
  of recent infarction similar to lacune parameters but with greater flair suggesting
  recent occurrence, not presented in this table-like Figure). The location of CMBs
  has further clinical importance in that lobar/cortical CMBs are CAA-related and
  deep, basal, infratentorial CMBs are hypertension-related. Revised table-like Figure
