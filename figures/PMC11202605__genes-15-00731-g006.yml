caption: Heatmaps of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with plant–pathogen
  interactions and the MAPK signaling pathway. (a) Heatmaps of the DEGs associated
  with calcium-binding proteins; (b) heatmaps of the DEGs associated with pathogenesis-related
  proteins; (c) heatmaps of the DEGs associated with disease resistance; (d) heatmaps
  of the DEGs associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 18
