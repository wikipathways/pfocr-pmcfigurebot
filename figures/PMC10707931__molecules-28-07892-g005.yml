figure_title: Functional GO and KEGG pathway classification of differentially expressed
  genes.
caption: Functional GO and KEGG pathway classification of differentially expressed
  genes. (A) The horizontal axis represents the enriched GO term, and the vertical
  axis represents the number of differentially expressed genes. (B) The three main
  categories of the directed acyclic graphs are displayed in the thumbnail view. The
  node colors are based on the q-values. The GO terms appear at the horizontal node
  locations; the darker the color, the higher the confidence level
