caption: Synergism between TMEM16A and EGFR in mediating the proliferation of tumors.
  There is a reciprocal exchange of Ca2+ between TMEM16A and EGFR. The two signaling
  pathways that mainly affect the proliferation of tumor cells are indicated by blue
  and green lines in the figure. The blue line indicates that upon activation, TMEM16A
  further activates the CAMK and AKT signaling pathways in succession, to act on CCND1
  and cause proliferation of the tumor. The green line indicates the MAPKK signaling
  pathway, in which phosphorylated MEK activates CCND1 and the ERK and AP-1/STAT-3/NF-κB
  signaling pathways, both of which finally act on the nuclear genes to cause tumor
  cell proliferation. EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; CCND1, cyclin D1; Grb2,
  growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; SOS, son of sevenless; CAMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase. Created with BioRender.com
