caption: Cellular mechanisms involved in the development of retinopathy of prematurity
  (ROP). During hyperoxic conditions, phase 1, nitro-oxidative stress induces apoptosis
  in retinal capillary endothelial cells by disrupting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
  During hypoxic conditions, phase 2, astrocytes and Müller glial cells secrete VEGF,
  while microglia secrete IL-1β, TNF-α, and metalloproteinases, promoting neovascularization
  by endothelial cells
