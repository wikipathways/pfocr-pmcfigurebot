figure_title: Pathways crosstalk illustration through in silico protein–protein interactions
  (PPI).
caption: 'Pathways crosstalk illustration through in silico protein–protein interactions
  (PPI). Lists of proteins belonging to each signaling pathway were obtained though
  the GESEA—Gene Set Enrichment Analysis—available at https://www.gsea-msigdb.org
  accessed on 13 April 2024. Then, PPI between each pathway and NF-κB subunits were
  assessed through STRING v12 (available at https://string-db.org/ accessed on 14
  April 2024). The parameters evaluated were co-occurrence, experiments, and databases,
  and the minimum required interaction score was 0.700, considered high. Chord plots
  to show individual interactions with RELA/p65, RELB, REL/c-REL, NFKB1/p52, and NFKB2/p50
  were generated through the SRplot online platform for data analysis and visualization
  (available at http://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/srplot accessed on 14 April 2024),
  and the percentage of proteins involved in PPI are expressed in pie charts. As an
  example, there are 233 proteins involved in the WNT pathway; from these, 82 (35.2%)
  interact with NF-κB subunits distributed as follows: 30 proteins with RELA/p65,
  8 with RELB, 10 with REL/c-REL, and 28 with NFKB2/p50. Similar patterns are seen
  for other pathways which, as expected, show more interactions with RELA/p65 and
  NFKB1/p52'
