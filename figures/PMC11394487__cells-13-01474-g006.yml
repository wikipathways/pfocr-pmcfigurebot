figure_title: ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.
caption: 'ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. Description: MAP2K1/2 activates ERK1/2 via phosphorylation.
  ERK1/2 activates Cpla2, ion channels, MAPKAPK5, and MKNK and inhibits SOS via phosphorylation,
  whereas the ERK1/2 dimer activates ELK1, ESR1, ETS, MSK1/2, STAT1/3, and c-Myc/N-Myc
  and inhibits PPARG via phosphorylation. Transcription is induced by ATF1, c-Myc/N-Myc,
  CREB, ELK1, ESR1, ETS, FOS, Histone H3, NFATC1, PPARG, SRF, Stat1/3, and EIF4E'
