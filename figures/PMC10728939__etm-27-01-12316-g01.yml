caption: 'Schematic of BAMBI structure. BAMBI is a 261-amino acid transmembrane protein
  involved in the regulation of the TGFβ and Wnt signaling pathways. The structure
  of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of BAMBI is similar to that of TGFβRI/BMPRI,
  whereas BAMBI lacks an equivalent intracellular Ser/Thr kinase domain. From left
  to right: red box, signal sequence; white box, seven conserved cysteines (vertical
  lines) and the putative extracellular domain of the cysteine box (gray); black,
  transmembrane domain; green and yellow, GS and Ser/Thr kinase domains, respectively,
  of TGFBRI/BMPRI; blue, intracellular domain of BAMBI. TGFβ, transforming growth
  factor β; BAMBI, BMP and activin receptor membrane-bound inhibitor; BMPR1, bone
  morphogenetic protein receptor type 1; GS, glycine- and serine-rich sequence; Ser/Thr,
  serine/threonine'
