caption: 'The ASFV-induced necroptosis signaling depends on the TNF-α-RIPK1 pathway
  in PAMs and BMDMs. PAMs (A, B) or BMDMs (C, D) were infected with ASFV at 1.0 MOI
  for 24 h to induce necroptosis, while cells without treatment (MOCK) were used as
  the negative control. PAMs (A, B) and BMDMs (C, D) were pretreated with IFN-β (1,000
  U/ml) for 8 h to induce the expression of RIPK3 and then were cotreated with TSZ
  (T: 100 ng/ml recombine porcine TNF-α; S: 50 nM SM-164; Z: 50 μM Z-VAD-FMK) for
  16 h to activate the TNF-α-RIPK1 pathway-dependent necroptosis as the positive control.
  During infecting with ASFV or treatment with TSZ, cells were treated with RIPK3
  inhibitor GSK''872 (1 μM) or MLKL inhibitor GW806742X (1 nM) to inhibit the necroptosis
  signaling. RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1 (50 μM) was used to inhibit the necroptosis signaling
  dependent on the TNF-α-RIPK1 pathway. (A, C) The protein expression and protein
  phosphorylation level of RIPK3 and MLKL in cell lysates (Lys) were examined by western
  blot. (B, D) The relative LDH release in the supernatants was determined by cytotoxicity
  assay. Data shown are means ± SD. Statistical significance was analyzed by Student''s
  t-test. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.'
