figure_title: ATX/LPA signaling pathway in different inflammatory diseases.
caption: 'ATX/LPA signaling pathway in different inflammatory diseases. ATX/LPA signaling
  pathway mediates various inflammatory diseases through LPA receptors. LPA1 promotes
  MS by activating M1 macrophages; LPA2 worsens DSS-induced IBD; LPA2 causes asthma
  by enhancing IL-13 expression via activating PKA signaling pathway; LPA1 and LPA3
  promote BPD by producing IL-6 via activating NF-κB signaling pathway; LPA1 and LPA3
  activate ERK signaling pathway, which promotes BPD and worsens RA via producing
  MMP; and LPA3 mediates the pathogenesis of RA by activating p38 MAPK signaling pathway.
  (Abbreviations: LPL—lysophospholipid; ATX—autotaxin; LPA—lysophosphatidic acid;

  cAMP—cyclic adenosine 3,5-monophosphate; PKA—protein kinase A; IL—interleukin; NIK—NF-κB-inducing
  kinase; IKK—IκB kinase; NF-κB—nuclear factor κB; ERK—extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase; MMP—matrix metalloproteinase; TAK—transforming growth-factor-β-activated
  kinase; MKK—mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; BPD—bronchopulmonary dysplasia;
