figure_title: TSA enhances ferroptosis induced by cisplatin.
caption: TSA enhances ferroptosis induced by cisplatin. (a) Fluorescence images of
  ROS probe DCFH-DA showing the ROS level of A549 cells treated with DDP (8 μM), TSA
  (1 μM), or DDP (8 μM) and TSA (1 μM) for 48 h. (b) ROS level in A549 cells measured
  by the fluorescence intensity of randomly selected single cells shown in (a). (c)
  Fluorescence images of liperfluo probe showing the level of lipid peroxidation in
  A549 cells treated under different conditions. (d) Lipid peroxidation level in A549
  cells measured by the fluorescence intensity of randomly selected single cells shown
  in (c). (e) Diagrammatic presentation of ferroptosis pathway induced by SLC3A2 and
  TFAM. In panels (b,c), the data are presented as means ± SD; and **** p < 0.0001
