caption: Model of the MAPK signaling pathway functions in regulating the integrity
  of the HTB and spermatogenesis in E. sinensis. ERK and p38 MAPK modulate the expression
  of es-MMP14, which can degrade junctional proteins, such as ZO-1. In addition, es-CREB
  may regulate the transcription level of ZO-1 as a transcription factor downstream
  of ERK. JNK participates in the maintenance of the HTB integrity via the distribution
  of junctional proteins, which is decided by cytoskeleton. Normal MAPK signaling
  pathway is critical for the functional HTB and spermatogenesis in E. sinensis
