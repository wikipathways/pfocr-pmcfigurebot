figure_title: Natural products that modulate specific proteins in the molecular pathway
  of inducing and inhibiting ferroptosis.
caption: 'Natural products that modulate specific proteins in the molecular pathway
  of inducing and inhibiting ferroptosis. This pathway is drawn by considering the
  information from many literature reports [173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189].
  Natural products that target these specific proteins have been described in Table
  1. The ferroptosis-inducing and inhibiting natural products are indicated in black
  and red, respectively. Although these natural products potentially target the ferroptosis
  signaling pathway, their potential impact on ferroptosis still warrants detailed
  investigation. The ferroptosis-inducing and inhibiting targets (as described in
  Section 1.3.1 and Section 1.3.2) are indicated in blue and red, respectively. Natural
  products that may induce the targets are indicated by an arrow line, while natural
  products that may inhibit the targets are indicated by a “T” line. Abbreviations
