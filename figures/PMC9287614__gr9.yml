caption: Schematic representation of the measured mechanisms regulating NF-κB signalling
  in human skeletal muscle in response to exhaustive exercise in normoxia and severe
  hypoxia. Extracellular and intracellular signals such as Ca2+, lactate, H+, Pi,
  AMP and RONS evoked by an incremental exercise to exhaustion largely activated CaMKII.
  CaMKII activation reduces the inhibitory action of IκB proteins via phosphorylation,
  which targets them for proteasomal degradation by a direct or indirect mechanism
  (through CaMKIIδD-mediated activation of IKKβ). This was accompanied by an increase
  in the total levels of IKKα, which should favour the nuclear translocation of the
  p65-p50 heterodimer and transcriptional regulation of NF-κB-responsive genes. The
  phosphorylation levels of the RONS-sensitive upstream kinases ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK
  were not elevated by the exhausting exercise test. Overall, the activation in NF-κB
  signalling was associated with increased and decreased GR and Trx1protein content,
  respectively. No changes were found for Gpx1 and TrxR1 after incremental exercise.
  Several key markers increased by exercise were rapidly downregulated within 60 s
  when the leg recovered with free circulation, demonstrating a fast regulation of
  NF-κB at exercise cessation which depends on muscle reoxygenation. None of the proteins
  studied were differentially modulated by performing exercise either in normoxia
  or severe hypoxia. Stimulating/inhibiting effects are represented by blue/red connecting
  lines (dashed if the effect is indirect). Known actions not observed in the present
  investigation are shown in grey (dashed if the effect is indirect). Changes in cellular
  locations are depicted with black dashed lines. The arrows in yellow shown beside
  the specific markers, illustrate the magnitude of the overall protein expression
  changes (increase/decrease) in this investigation. (For interpretation of the references
  to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
  article).
