caption: Up-regulation of miRNA 5101 on LPS-induced autophagy in Kupffer cells. (A,B)
  WB results pertaining to the expressive levels of pertinent proteins within the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and cell autophagy process after overexpression
  of 5101. (C,D) WB results pertaining to the expressive levels of pertinent proteins
  within the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and cell autophagy process after knockdown
  of 5101. (E,F) Immunofluorescence co-localization assay conducted to detect the
  autophagic flux after overexpression and knockdown of 5101 (*, p < 0.05; **, p <
  0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001; ns, not significant)
