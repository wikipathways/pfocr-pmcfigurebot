caption: Inhibitory effect of NXC736 in RILF via the Smad signaling pathway. (A) Representative
  immunohistochemical images and quantification of irradiated lung tissues using anti-Smad4
  and anti-pSmad2/3. Magnification, 100×, 400× (n = 3~6). (B) Western blot analysis
  of pSmad2/3, Smad2/3, and Smad4 expression in L132 cells exposed to 6 Gy IR (n =
  3, triplicate). A statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of
  variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Tukey’s test was
  utilized to assess significant differences between individual groups. Data are expressed
  as mean ± standard deviation (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01)
