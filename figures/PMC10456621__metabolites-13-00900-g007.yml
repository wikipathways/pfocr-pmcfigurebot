caption: Metabolite pathway analysis showed the 12 most enriched metabolic pathways
  between the PM-related CNV and PM control groups. In this plot, “GeneNumber” refers
  to the number of genes associated with each metabolic pathway. The Enrichment Score
  represents the degree of enrichment for a specific pathway and is calculated based
  on statistical analysis, taking into account the relative abundance of metabolites
  and their association with the pathway. The higher the Enrichment Score, the more
  significantly enriched the pathway is in the PM-CNV group compared to the PM control
  group
