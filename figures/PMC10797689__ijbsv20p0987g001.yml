caption: Glutamine catabolism is involved in the activation of renal fibroblasts.
  (A) We used TGF-β1 to stimulate rat renal fibroblasts (NRK-49F) to construct a model
  of fibroblasts transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. Untargeted metabolomics
  showed changes in metabolites during fibroblast activation. (B) Further metabolic
  pathway analysis of differential metabolites was assessed. (C) A targeted analysis
  focusing specifically on glutamine metabolism was performed. (D) and (E) NRK-49F
  were treated with TGF-β1 for 0h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h. The protein level of GLS1 was
  detected by Western blot analysis. (F) Real-time PCR showed the mRNA level of GLS1.
  (G) Immunofluorescence staining showed the expression of GLS1. Scale bars are 50
  µm. (H) Serum and renal biopsy specimens from IgA nephropathy patients with mild,
  moderate, and severe fibrosis. The levels of glutamine were examined by ELISA. (I)
  Immunofluorescence staining detected the expression of GLS1 in renal biopsy specimens.
  Scale bars are 50 µm. *p < 0.05
