caption: 'Genes of the TLR signaling pathway observed in chicken thrombocytes. TLR:
  toll-like receptor; MD2: myeloid differentiation protein 2; CD14: cluster of differentiation
  14; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MyD88: myeloid differentiation primary-response protein
  88; TIRAP: Toll/Il-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein; TRIF: Toll/Il-1
  receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β; IRAK: IL-1 receptor-associated
  protein kinase; TRAF: tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; NF-κB-nuclear
  factor κB; TANK-TRAF-family-member-associated NF-κB activator; MAPKs: mitogen-activated
  protein kinases; AP-1: activator protein; IRF: interferon regulatory factor; IKK-IκB
  kinase; and ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Created with BioRender.com
