caption: 'ZEA and DON can inhibit TLR2/NFκB the signaling pathway in mice infected
  with L. monocytogenes. (A,B) The mRNA and protein expression of TLR2 and MyD88 were
  measured by qPCR and western blotting. (C) Protein expression and phosphitylation
  levels of TRAF6, p-TAK1, p-IκBα/IκBα, and p-NFκB/NFκB. Values are the mean ± SD
  of three individual experiments. ## p <  0.01, indicate significant differences
  between the L. monocytogenes group and control groups; * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01,
  indicate significant differences between toxin treated groups and the L. monocytogenes
  group'
