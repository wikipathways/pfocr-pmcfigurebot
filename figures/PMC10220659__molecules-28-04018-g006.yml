caption: Network pharmacology analysis revealed possible targets and molecular mechanisms
  by which TFPS regulated the polarisation of TAMs. (A) Venn diagram showed the target
  interaction between TAMs and TFPS. PPI network of 193 intersected targets (B) was
  generated by STRING, and the top 20 targets (C) were presented. GO terms (D) and
  KEGG pathway (E) of 193 intersected targets were visualized
