caption: The immune control mechanism in plants by miPs (lncRNA, circRNA, and miPEPs).
  Receptors on the host surface detect the PAMPs or MAMPs associated with the pathogen.
  The successful recognition reaction leads to respiratory burst oxidase (RBOH) activation,
  leading to cellular redox alteration and subsequent calcium channel activation.
  ROS and calcium influx perpetuate a mutual activation cycle. The redox alteration
  and calcium influx readily activate transcription modulators, e.g., MAP kinases
  (MAPKs) and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). The consorted internal signaling
  leads to disease resistance by varied defense-responsive gene expression. The microRNAs
  (miRNAs) have an intricate relationship with defense response in plants. There are
  many miRNA targets in the plant defense response pathway, which can modulate resistance
  response in multitier control modules. The lncRNA, circRNA, and miPEPs can alter
  or mimic the targets of these miRNAs and, hence, have multifaceted control over
  plant immunity. Some studies report the direct correlation of lncRNA with miRNA
  and mRNA networks in plant defense response. The regulatory action of other forms
  of miPs is urgently required to decipher the complete scenario of the control mechanism
  of these small regulators in plant immunity. These non-coding RNAs also control
  the balance between healthy and diseased conditions in plants
