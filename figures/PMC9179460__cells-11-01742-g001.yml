  are according to [,,] with some modifications. Non-hydroxy acyl sphingosine (NS);
  Non-hydroxy acyl 4-hydroxydihydrosphingosine (NP); Non-hydroxy acyl dihydrosphingosine
  (NDS); Non-hydroxy acyl 6-hydroxydsphingosine (NH); Non-hydroxy acyl 4,14-sphingadiene
  (NSD); 2-hydroxy acyl sphingosine (AS); 2-hydroxy acyl 4-hydroxydihydrosphingosine
  (AP); 2-hydroxy acyl dihydrosphingosine (ADS); 2-hydroxy acyl 6-hydroxy sphingosine
  (AH); 2-hydroxy acyl 4,14-sphingadiene (ASD); ß-hydroxy acyl sphingosine (BS); ω-hydroxy-N-non-hydroxy
  acyl sphingosine (OS); ω-hydroxy-N-non-hydroxy acyl 4-hydroxydihydrosphingosine
  (OP); ω-hydroxy-N-non-hydroxy acyl dihydrosphingosine (ODS), ω-hydroxy-N-non-hydroxy
  acyl 6-hydroxydsphingosine (OH); ω-hydroxy-N-non-hydroxy acyl 4,14-sphingadiene
  (OSD); ω-O-acyl-N-non-hydroxy acyl sphingosine (EOS); ω-O-acyl-N-non-hydroxy acyl
