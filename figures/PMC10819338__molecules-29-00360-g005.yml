caption: The canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. The canonical pathway
  is triggered by TLRs, TNFRs, and IL-1R, leading to the phosphorylation and degradation
  of the inhibitory protein IκB. NF-κB is activated by its release from the IκB-containing
  complex and translocates into the nucleus. The non-canonical pathway depends on
  the activation of p100/RelB complex by BAFFR, CD40, and RANK. This cascade involves
  the phosphorylation of NIK, which in turn phosphorylates IKKα. Subsequently, the
  p52-RelB heterodimer is activated and translocates to the nucleus
