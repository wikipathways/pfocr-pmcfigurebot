caption: The mechanism by which mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (MSCs-Exos)
  promotes angiogenesis and regulates blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) integrity.
  MSCs-Exos can promote angiogenesis by promoting the expression of vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) via the PKA signaling pathway. BMSC-Exos can suppress pericyte
  pyroptosis and inhibit pericyte migration by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway
  to maintain BSCB integrity. MSCs-Exos could increase the expression of cell junction
  proteins via the TIMP2/MMP pathway to attenuate the destruction of the BSCB. MSCs-Exos
  could reduce BSCB permeability by targeting M2 macrophages to upregulate TGFβ and
  TGFβ receptor expression
