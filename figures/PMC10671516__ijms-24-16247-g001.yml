figure_title: Paracrine-mediated signaling between granulosa cells and oocytes.
caption: Paracrine-mediated signaling between granulosa cells and oocytes. Oocytes
  mainly secrete the paracrine factors BMP15 and GDF9. BMP binds to a dimer composed
  of the TGFβ receptor ALK6/BMPRII and activates SMAD1,5,8. GDF9 binds to a dimer
  composed of ALK5/BMPR8 and activates SMAD2,3. SMAD controls a variety of biological
  processes by regulating gene transcription. These include the upregulation of PTX3
  and HAS2 expression to promote hyaluronan synthesis and COC expansion; inhibition
  of CX43 to reduce TZP; inhibition of StAR to reduce progesterone production; regulation
  of apoptosis-related genes such as BAX, CASP9, TP53, and BCL2 to achieve apoptosis
  inhibition; and regulation of granulosa cell KITL1 protein levels. KITL is a granulosa
  cell paracrine factor that activates KIT in response to FSH stimulation and activates
  the P13K-AKT-FKHRL1 pathway to regulate oocyte survival, activation, and apoptosis.
  BMP15 promotes the expression of KITL1/2 and is inhibited by high concentrations
  of KITL. GDF9 inhibits KITL expression. BMP15—bone morphogenetic protein 15; GDF9—growth
  differentiation factor 9; SMAD—Sma- and Mad-related proteins; PTX3—pentraxin 3;
  HAS2—hyaluronan synthase 2; CX43—connexin 43; StAR—steroidogenic acute regulatory
  protein; KITL—stem cell factor (also known as Kit ligand); FSH—follicle-stimulating
  hormone; FKHRL1—Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1)
