figure_title: ACE2 transcription is regulated by the Wnt3a/β-catenin pathway.
caption: ACE2 transcription is regulated by the Wnt3a/β-catenin pathway. (A) Tissue
  transcriptional expression of ACE2 and Wnt3a in the lungs from the Genotype-Tissue
  Expression (GTEx) Project. TPM, transcripts per million. (B) Spike Vpp infection
  in Wnt3a and ACE2-transfected cells. H1650 cells transfected with the indicated
  plasmids were transduced with Spike or VSV-G Vpp at 24 hpt, and luciferase accumulations
  were measured at 48 hpi. (C) Summary of computer-assisted search for the putative
  binding sites of selected transcription factors (LEF-1, TCF-4, and TCF-4E) in the
  promoter regions of human ACE2 using Alggen Promo software, V 3.0.2. (http://alggen.lsi.upc.es;
  accessed on 14 September 2022). Factor name—transcription factor with its TRANSFAC
  (V 8.3) database accession number. Putative binding sites—number of predicted binding
  sites. (D) ACE2 RNA expression in Spike Vpp-infected cells. ACE2 RNA expression
  was measured in Spike Vpp-infected cells (MOI 0.5) at 24 hpi by qRT-PCR and compared
  to mock-infected cells. (E) ACE2 RNA levels in Wnt3a KD cells. ACE2 RNA expression
  was measured in Wnt3a KD cells by qRT-PCR and compared to shLacZ. (F) ACE2 RNA levels
  in Wnt3a-CM-treated cells. ACE2 RNA levels were measured in H1650 cells treated
  with the indicated concentrations of control or Wnt3a-CM for 24 h. (G) Effect of
  disruption of β-catenin pathway on ACE2 RNA levels. H1650 cells were treated with
  the indicated concentrations of iCRT14 for 24 h and were subsequently harvested
  for qRT-PCR. The levels of ACE2 RNA were normalized by GAPDH RNA. Values represent
  the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***,
  p < 0.001 compared with controls (n = 3)
