caption: Pathway categories containing significantly enriched signaling pathways in
  vehicle or BIO 300 treated mice with TBI. Bubble chart depicting the signaling pathways
  within specific pathway categories. (A) Enriched pathways on Day 1 in BIO 300 (200
  mg/kg, BID) treated mice with TBI compared to vehicle-treated animals with TBI.
  (B) Enriched pathways on Day 1 in vehicle-treated mice with TBI compared to unirradiated,
  vehicle-treated mice. Each bubble represents a different signaling pathway, blue
  bubbles are inhibited pathways and orange bubbles are activated pathways with darker
  shading indicating higher absolute z-scores. The size of each bubble is based on
  the ratio of enriched genes in the data set compared to the total number of genes
  associated with the pathway. The larger the bubble, the higher the ratio. The signaling
  pathways within each pathway category are provided in Supplementary Tables S1 and
  S2 for panel A and B, respectively
