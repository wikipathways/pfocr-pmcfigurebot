caption: Major signaling pathways and functions of S1P. S1P can act intracellularly
  to induce either apoptosis or proliferation. S1P can also be exported and can bind
  S1P receptors in autocrine or paracrine ways. In the circulation, S1P is transported
  bound to albumin and/or HDL S1P regulates many normal and pathophysiological processes.
