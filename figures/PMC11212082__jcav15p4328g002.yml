caption: IFN-γ strengthens the suppressive effect on cell growth of AT-II in CRC cells.
  (A) HT29 and (B) HCT15 cells were administrated with increasing dosages of AT-II
  and IFN-γ alone or in combination. Then, the cell viability of HT29 and HCT15 cells
  was measured using CCK-8 assay after 24h. Data was expressed as mean ± SD. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, vs. Control (0) group.
article_title: Atractylenolide II combined with Interferon-γ synergistically ameliorates
