caption: Visualization of dynamic pathways of primary and phenolic metabolites. (a)
  Yellow fills indicate enzymes that cause changes in the pathway, while green fills
  indicate metabolites with significant changes in the pathway. The flavanone metabolic
  pathway is represented by pink boxes, the flavonol metabolic pathway by green boxes,
  and the monolignol metabolic pathway by blue boxes. In the heat map, the color pink
  denotes that UV-B duress has almost no impact on the enzyme, the color light purple
  denotes that UV-B radiation inhibits the enzyme’s activity, and the color dark purple
  denotes that UV-B radiation increases the enzyme’s activity; likewise, a metabolite’s
  light brown hue suggests that UV-B radiation is downregulating it, whereas a metabolite’s
  dark brown color indicates that UV-B radiation is upregulating it. (b–d) L-phenylalanine,
  naringenin chalcone, and Trans-5-O-(p-Coumaroyl) shikimate all show significant
  alterations. Significant difference (* p < 0.05)
