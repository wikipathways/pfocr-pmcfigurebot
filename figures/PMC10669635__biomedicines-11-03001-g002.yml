figure_title: PI3K-Akt signalling pathway.
caption: PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. Upon ligand binding, conformational changes
  occur in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), the PI3 kinases are then activated
  by RTK and translocate to the plasma membrane. Activated PI3K then converts PIP2
  to PIP3. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain containing protein, Akt then translocate
  to the membrane, bind to PIP3, and phosphorylate at the Threonine 308 residue by
  PDK1. Akt translocates back to the cytoplasm and is phosphorylated further at Serine
  473 and Threonine 450 residues by mTORC2. Activated Akt is responsible for initiating
  various cellular activities such as proliferation, protein synthesis, autophagy,
  cell survival, etc
