caption: RT-qPCR of 6wpf zebrafish (D. rerio). Comparisons between wild-type and scoliotic
  kif7co63/co63 (A), wild-type and non-scoliotic kif7co63/co63 (B), and scoliotic
  kif7co63/co63 and non-scoliotic kif7co63/co63 (C) was performed for genes in the
  shh signaling pathway and the keratin genes observed in the RNA sequencing data.
  Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates
