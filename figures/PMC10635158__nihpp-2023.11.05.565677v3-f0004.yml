figure_title: The FXR1 network is required for RhoA signaling-induced actomyosin reorganization
caption: A. All mRNAs expressed in HeLa cells are grouped based on their FXR1 binding
  pattern. mRNAs not bound by FXR1 (N=6574), bound by FXR1 but network-independent
  (N=1104), bound by FXR1 and network-dependent (N=1223). Boxes represent median,
  25th and 75th percentiles, error bars represent 5–95% confidence intervals. Mann-Whitney
  test, ***, P<10−53.B. As in (A), but mRNA length is shown. Mann-Whitney test, ***,
  P<10−14.C. As in (A), but AU-content of mRNAs is shown. Mann-Whitney test, ***,
  P<10−54.D. Gene ontology analysis for FXR1 network-dependent mRNA targets. Shown
  are the top functional gene classes and their Bonferroni-corrected P values.E. Schematic
  of RhoA signaling pathway-induced actomyosin remodeling. The critical signaling
  event for actomyosin dynamics is RLC phosphorylation of NM II. Protein symbols with
  black outlines are FXR1 mRNA targets. ELC, essential light chain. P, phosphorylated
  residue.F. Phalloidin staining of filamentous actin in A549 cells expressing the
  indicated shRNAs after serum starvation and stimulation with thrombin for 30 minutes.
  DAPI staining visualizes the nucleus. Representative images are shown. Scale bar,
  40 μm.G. Quantification of the experiment in (F) shown as mean ± std obtained from
  at least three independent experiments. For each experiment and each sample at least
  150 cells were counted, except for the ROCK2 KD experiment, where 34 cells were
  counted. One-way ANOVA, ****, P<0.0001.H. As in (F), but A549 clonal cells with
  heterozygous N202S mutations in endogenous FXR1 were used. Shown are representative
  images.I. Quantification of the experiment in (H) shown as mean ± std obtained from
  at least three independent experiments. For each experiment and each sample at least
  28 cells were counted. One-way ANOVA, ****, P<0.0001.J. As in (F), but A549 clonal
  cells with heterozygous G266E mutations in endogenous FXR1 were used. Shown are
  representative images.K. Quantification of the experiment in (J) shown as mean ±
  std obtained from three independent experiments. For each experiment and each sample,
  at least 70 cells were counted. One-way ANOVA, ****, P<0.0001
