caption: Sema7A/PlxnC1 signaling implicates in TRIM67-regulated synapse development
  of mitral cells. (A) RT-qPCR reveals that the expression level of Sema7A mRNA was
  decreased in the OB of KO mice compared with WT mice (n = 4). (B) RT-qPCR reveals
  that the expression level of PlxnC1 mRNA was decreased in the OB of KO mice compared
  with WT mice (n = 4). (C) RT-qPCR reveals that the expression level of CDC42 mRNA
  was reduced in the OB of KO mice compared with WT mice (n = 4). (D) RT-qPCR reveals
  that the expression level of NMDA-R mRNA in the OB of KO mice was reduced compared
  with that of WT mice (n = 4). (E,F) Western blot and quantification show reduced
  protein expression of CDC42 in the OB of TRIM67 KO mice (n = 3). (Gâ€“I) RT-qPCR quantifications
  show increased expression of genes related with the Sema7A/PlxnC1 signaling pathway
  in TRIM67 overexpressed 293T cells (n = 4). Error bars represent SEM. * p-value
  < 0.05; ** p-value < 0.01
