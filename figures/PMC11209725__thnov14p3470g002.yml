caption: GPAT3 is highly expressed in sorafenib resistance cells of HCC. (A) Enrichment
  analysis of “lipid biosynthetic process” pathway in CN- and SR-MHCC97H cells. (B)
  De novo TAG synthesis-related mRNA expression in CN- and SR-MHCC97H and Hep3B cells.
  (C) Seven significantly differentially expressed mRNA genes related to de novo TAG
  synthesis were observed in CN-, SR-MHCC97H, and Hep3B cells. (D) De novo TAG synthesis-related
  mRNA and protein expression in CN- and SR-MHCC97H cells. (E) GPAT3 is involved in
  de novo synthesis pathway diagram of TAG. (F) Protein levels of GPAT3 in CN- and
  SR-MHCC97H and Hep3B cells were detected by WB. (G) Expression analysis of GPAT3
  in parental and sorafenib-resistant cells xenograft tumor mouse model (GSE121153).
  (H) Expression of GPAT3 in HCC patients with or without RFS response treated with
  placebo or sorafenib (GSE109211). Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 3). (I)
  Kaplan Meier Plotter database analysis of prognosis in female patients with high
  or low GPAT3 expression. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. ns represents no significant
  difference.
