caption: Role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in MPP8-mediated regulatory effects
  on the malignant phenotypes of HCC cells. (A) Western blotting was used to detect
  the effect of MPP8 knockdown on the PI3K/Akt pathway, and to confirm the validity
  of IGF-1 as the agonist of this pathway. Rescue experiments with activation of the
  PI3K/Akt pathway were performed to determine whether this pathway was involved in
  MPP8-mediated regulation of the proliferation assessed by (B) CCK-8 and (C) colony
  formation assay, (D) migration was assessed by wound-healing assay (scale bar, 200
  µm), and (E) invasion was assessed by Transwell invasion assay (scale bar, 50 µm)
  in HCC cells. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. corresponding control. MPP8, M-phase phosphoprotein
  8; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; siRNA, small interfering RNA; p-, phosphorylated;
  t-, total; CCK-8, Cell Counting Kit-8; OD, optical density; IGF-1, insulin-like
  growth factor-1
