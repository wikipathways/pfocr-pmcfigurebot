caption: Activation of intracellular apoptotic signaling pathways by naringenin in
  HepG2 cells. (A) The proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins expressed by HepG2
  cells exposed to different concentrations of quercetin were tracked with Western
  blotting. (B) Bands were quantified, and results are expressed as a percentage of
  control; Î²-actin was used as the loading control. Bars with different characters
  are statistically different at * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and **** p < 0.0001
