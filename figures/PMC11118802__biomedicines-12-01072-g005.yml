caption: The sGC signaling pathway is required for NO-mediating ACC-ACC synaptic potentiation.
  (a) Averaged frequency and amplitude of sEPSC before and after the LFS applied through
  the ACC-ACC connection in the ACSF containing ODQ, the inhibitor of sGC. The LFS
  was applied 10 min after the baseline recording (shown in arrow). (b) Averaged frequency
  and amplitude of sEPSC in the ACSF containing Rp-8-pCPT-cGMP, the inhibitor of PKC.
  (c,d) Summarized results of the frequency and amplitude of sEPSC applying ODQ or
  Rp-8-pCPT-cGMP
