figure_title: Isoalantolactone combined with cisplatin regulates the survival signaling
  pathways in A2780cisR and SNU-8cisR OC cells.
caption: 'Isoalantolactone combined with cisplatin regulates the survival signaling
  pathways in A2780cisR and SNU-8cisR OC cells. Cells were treated with cisplatin
  2 µg/mL (A2780cisR) and 5 µg/mL (SNU-8cisR) or in combination with 10 µM isoalantolactone
  for 24 h: (A) The combined effect of isoalantolactone–cisplatin on the MAPK signaling
  pathway. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK was confirmed using Western
  blotting. (B) The combined effect of isoalantolactone–cisplatin on AKT and AMPK
  signaling. The phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK was confirmed using Western blotting.
  (C) The combined effect of isoalantolactone–cisplatin on MEK signaling. Cell lysates
  from A2780cisR and SNU-8cisR OC cells were confirmed using Western blotting. (D)
  The attenuation of cisplatin resistance by isoalantolactone in A2780cisR and SNU-8cisR
  OC cells. Cells were treated with 10 μM isoalantolactone, followed by cisplatin
  (0–40 µg/mL) for 48 h. Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 assay. IC50 values
  are shown'
