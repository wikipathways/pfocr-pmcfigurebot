caption: Signaling pathways that connect mTORC1 activity with ferroptosis regulation.
  mTORC1 is activated by growth factor signaling through the RTK-PI3K-Akt axis, of
  which one downstream outcome is the elevated MUFA production mediated by SREBP1
  and SCD1. Growth factor signaling also promotes glucose uptake, which antagonizes
  AMPK activity. AMPK increases, while mTORC1 decreases, ULK1 activity that is required
  for autophagy initiation. Autophagic degradation of ferritin, a process termed ferrotinophagy,
  promotes ferroptosis by releasing iron from the intracellular iron store. The p53
  tumor suppressor promotes expression of Sestrin2 that inhibits mTORC1 activity.
  On the other hand, p53 represses the expression of SLC7A11 required by the system
  xc− plasma membrane antiporter, thereby promoting ferroptosis. Both these anti-mTORC1
  and pro-ferroptosis roles are key components of the p53-mediated tumor suppressive
  function. mTORC1 promotes NRF2 activation by increasing KEAP1 degradation. NRF2
  acts as a transcription factor that promotes the expression of enzymes involved
  in glutathione biosynthesis for ferroptosis suppression. Besides mTORC1, the Hippo
  pathway is another mechanism of cell size and growth regulation. The Hippo pathway
  effector proteins YAP and TAZ promote ferroptosis partly by increasing the expression
  of transferrin receptor and the acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4).
  Intercellular contact mediated by cadherin proteins led to NF2 activation and subsequently
  nuclear exclusion of YAP, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis. RTK, receptor tyrosine
  kinase. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase. PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog. GLUT1,
  glucose transporter 1 (encoded by SLC2A1). AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase. ULK1,
  unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1. KEAP1, kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1. NRF2, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2. SREBP1, sterol regulatory element binding
  protein 1. SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1. MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid. NF2,
  also known as MERLIN. LATS1/2, large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2. YAP, Yes1 associated
  transcriptional regulator. TAZ, also known as WWTR1, WW domain containing transcription
  regulator 1.
