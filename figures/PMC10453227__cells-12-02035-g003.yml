figure_title: Attenuation of SIRT6 expression with age.
caption: 'Attenuation of SIRT6 expression with age. (A) Canonical pathway enrichment
  analysis was calculated based on the protein expression fold change between the
  youngest-aged rats (2 ms, n = 4) and the oldest-aged rats (15 ms, n = 4) in this
  study. (B) Volcano plot of the pairwise comparison between the youngest-aged rat
  (2 ms) and the oldest-aged rat (15 ms) group proteomes. Expression fold changes
  were converted to log2 from the ratio value. The dotted line indicates the significance
  threshold (p < 0.05) by ANOVA statistical analysis, and the dark purple circle represents
  a protein related to the sirtuin signaling pathway. (C) Sirtuin protein levels were
  analyzed from the rotator cuff of rats aged 2 months, 7 months, and 15 months. (D)
  Representative immunohistochemical staining of SIRT6 in rotator cuff of rats. The
  bottom figures are enlarged figures of the black box above (black scale bars = 50
  μm, blue scale bars = 10 μm). (E) Number of SIRT6-positive cells out of total cell
  count in the rotator cuff of rats (n = 3). (F) mRNA level of Sirt6 from the rotator
  cuff of rats aged 2 months, 7 months, and 15 months (n = 6–8). (G,H) SIRT6 protein
  levels were analyzed from human subjects in their 20 s and 30 s, 50 s and 60 s,
  and 70 s and 80 s (n = 4–6). The band intensities were determined by densitometry
  and normalized to those of GAPDH. (I) mRNA level of SIRT6 from the rotator cuff
  of human subjects in their 20 s and 30 s, 50 s and 60 s, and 70 s and 80 s (n =
  4–6). ** p < 0.01 versus 20–30 s; ## p < 0.01 versus 50–60 s. The values are the
  mean ± SEM. ## p < 0.01 versus 7 ms; ** p < 0.01 versus 2 ms'
