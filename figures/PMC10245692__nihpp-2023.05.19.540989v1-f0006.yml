figure_title: Hepatic transcriptome from mice fed a NASH diet for 30 weeks
caption: Effect of feeding male mice either a control diet (10% kcal from fat) or
  NASH diet (40% kcal from fat, 20% kcal fructose, and 2% cholesterol) for 30 weeks
  on hepatic gene expression. Heat map of the top 40 differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs; A). Pathways related to fibrosis and immune response, including Hepatic Fibrosis
  Signaling Pathway, Pulmonary Fibrosis Idiopathic Signaling Pathway, and IL-8 signaling,
  are activated in the liver of animals fed a Western-style diet for 30 weeks compared
  to a control diet (B). Orange bars denote activated pathways (positive z-score >
  2), whereas blue bars denote inhibited pathways (negative z-score <âˆ’ 2.0). Putative
  upstream regulators of the DEGs at this time point include fibrosis- and immune-related
  molecules such as TGFB1 and TNF (C). In the liver of mice fed a NASH diet, the gene
  set for cytokine secretion is significantly enriched (D), including genes in the
  inflammasome pathway. Genes related to the inflammasome, including Aim2, Casp1,
  and Nlrp3, are upregulated in an animal-dependent manner. Other inflammasome-related
  genes, including Pycard, Tlr4, and Tlr9, are significantly upregulated in the liver
  of mice fed the NASH diet for 30 weeks compared to the control diet (E). Statistical
  significance was determined by t-test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. * p
  < 0.05, ** p <0.01
