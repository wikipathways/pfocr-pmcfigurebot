figure_title: PTEN restrains cysteine metabolism, and PTEN loss increases cystine
  uptake by xCT and promotes GSH synthesis
caption: (A) EC50 values of Pten WT and Pten KO MEFs subjected to 72-h cystine starvation.
  Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test.(B) Percent cell death in Pten WT and Pten
  KO MEFs treated with DRAQ7 subjected to cystine starvation titration. Unpaired two-tailed
  Student’s t test.(C–E) Relative metabolite abundance in Pten WT/Pten KO MEFs (liquid
  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS]). Unpaired two-tailed Student’s
  t test.(F) Relative percent accumulation of 13C into cystine and GSH synthesis pathway
  metabolites in Pten WT/Pten KO MEFs (LC-MS/MS). Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t
  test.(G) Cysteine metabolism overview.(H) Percent cell death in Pten WT and Pten
  KO MEFs treated with DRAQ7 and 125 nM erastin alone or in combination with 3 mM
  BSO or 125 mM GEE for 48 h. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test.(I) LD50 values
  of Pten WT/Pten KO MEFs treated with DRAQ7 and dose titrations of erastin alone
  or in combination with 3 mM BSO or 125 mM GSH ethyl ester (GEE). Fisher’s LSD statistical
  test. (J) Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) LD50 in Pten WT and Pten KO MEFs. Unpaired
  two-tailed Student’s t test.Met, methionine; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosyl
  homocysteine. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Each experiment
  was conducted with 3 technical replicates and repeated twice unless otherwise noted
