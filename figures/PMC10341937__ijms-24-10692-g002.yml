caption: Schematic representation of the canonical Wnt signal transduction pathway.
  (Left) The destruction complex of Axin, APC, GSK-3β, CK1α, and β-catenin is formed
  when the Wnt ligands are not present in the cytosol, and β-catenin is phosphorylated
  by CK1α and GSK-3β. (Right) In the presence of Wnt ligands, the signalling pathway
  is stimulated by recruiting Dvl and Axin proteins to the cell membrane and binding
  to the receptors (Fzd) and co-receptors (LRP5/6) consecutively. This process allows
  for stabilisation of β-catenin in the cytosol and translocation into the nucleus
  for signal transduction
