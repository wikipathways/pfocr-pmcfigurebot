figure_title: PARP1 regulates p65 protein stability through the ubiquitination-dependent
  pathway.
caption: PARP1 regulates p65 protein stability through the ubiquitination-dependent
  pathway. Summary of the proteomic GO enrichment analysis of downregulated genes
  (A) and upregulated genes (B) in Cal-62 cells treated with niraparib. (C) GSEA determined
  significant enrichment for NF-κB signaling genes correlated with niraparib treatment.
  (D) GSEA determined significant enrichment for NF-κB targets up genes correlated
  with niraparib treatment. (E) Heatmap from the proteome data showing the differentially
  expressed genes involved in the positive regulation of NF-κB signaling. (F) Western
  blot of phosphorylated p65, p65, and p21 of Cal-62 cells treated with niraparib.
  (G) Cal-62 cells were transfected with either scrambled or PARP1 siRNAs for 48 h,
  and protein levels were detected by western blot with the indicated antibodies.
  (H) Cal-62 cells overexpressing flag-PARP1 were treated with MG132 (10 uM) for 4
  h, and proteins were detected by western blot with indicated antibodies. (I) Cal-62
  cells treated with niraparib or DMSO were incubated with 10 ug/ml cycloheximide
  (CHX) for the indicated times. Lysates were harvested and analyzed by western blot.
  (J) Cal-62 cells were lysed with RIPA buffer, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation
  using either anti-IgG, anti-PARP1, or anti-p65 antibodies, and analyzed by western
  blot with indicated antibodies. (K) Cal-62 cells treated with niraparib or DMSO
  and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-p65 and analyzed by
  western blot with indicated antibodies. (L) Cal-62 cells were transfected with either
  scrambled or PARP1 siRNA for 48 h, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation
  using anti-p65 and analyzed by western blot with indicated antibodies. The data
  are presented as the mean ± SD. All *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
