caption: NCBP2 and c-JUN/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are significantly upregulated
  in PDAC patients. (A) The expression level of NCBP2, c-JUN, and p-ERK was determined
  by IHC analysis in tissue microarray. (B) The IHC scores of NCBP2, c-JUN, and p-ERK
  between PDAC and para-carcinoma tissues. (C) The correlation analysis results between
  NCBP2, c-JUN, and p-ERK based on their IHC scores in PDAC tissues. (D) A schematic
  model of NCBP2 function in PDAC. NCBP2 upregulates c-JUN-mediated MEK/ERK signaling
  activation in an m7G methylation-dependent manner, *** p < 0.001
