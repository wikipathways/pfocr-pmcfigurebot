figure_title: Cell-cell communication in the developing human neocortex
caption: a, Spatial transcriptomic analysis of six neocortical samples. Cells are
  color-coded by types or the niches to which they belong. b, Proportion of different
  cell types in individual niches. Niche numbers correspond to the legend in panel
  a. c, Heatmap showing neighborhood enrichment scores of the PFC sample at infancy.
  The row and column annotations are color-coded by cell types, the legend of which
  can be found in panel a. d, Heatmap showing the percentage of significant intercellular
  communication determined by NCEM identified across all datasets. The row and column
  annotations are color-coded by cell types, the legend of which can be found in panel
  a. e, Left, a circular plot showing the direction of cellular interactions mediated
  by neuregulin signaling. Right, a dotplot showing communication probability of example
  ligand-receptor pairs in the neuregulin signaling pathway from EN-IT-Immature to
  other cell types. Empty space means the communication probability is zero. P-values
  were calculated by one-sided permutation test. f, Left, a circular plot showing
  the direction of cellular interactions mediated by somatostatin signaling. Right,
  a dotplot showing communication probability of example ligand-receptor pairs in
  the somatostatin signaling pathway from IN-MGE-SST to other cell types. Empty space
  means the communication probability is zero. P-values were calculated by one-sided
  permutation test
