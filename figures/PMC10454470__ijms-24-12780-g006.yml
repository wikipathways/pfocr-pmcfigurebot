  of ETC III/IV genes through ERK- and Akt-related signaling pathways.
caption: Galectin-3 inhibited the nuclear translocation of NRF-1 and the transcription
  of ETC III/IV genes through ERK- and Akt-related signaling pathways. (A) The expression
  of ETC complexes III and IV genes in CD8+ T cells co-cultured with A549-3a cells.
  The TD-139 group was treated with the galectin-3 inhibitor TD-139 for 48 h. (B)
  CD8+ T cells were examined by confocal microscopy for the localization and expression
  of NRF-1 (red). Nuclei were visualized using DAPI counterstain (blue). All scale
  bars correspond to 5 Âµm. (C) Quantification of nuclear fluorescence intensities
  of NRF-1. (D) Phosphokinase production of CD8+ T cells co-cultured with A549-3a
  cells for 24 h in the presence or absence of TD-139 was compared using a commercial
  protein array kit. After quantification, 25 differentially expressed proteins were
  identified and visualized in heatmap. The color bar on the left represents the relative
  expression levels. (E) Bar diagram of the enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed proteins involved in (D). Color indicates the number of genes involved
  in a specific signaling pathway. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
