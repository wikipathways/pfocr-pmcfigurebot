figure_title: Single-cell cell cycle transitions analysis.
caption: Single-cell cell cycle transitions analysis. In panel a, the HeLa S3 cell
  line is processed using Seurat, with the cells being aggregated to create metacells
  from which four networks are being generated using hdWGCNA. The four networks correspond
  to the cell cycle phases G1, S, G2, and M (panel a). The two transitions that are
  being analyzed are G1 to S (green) and G2 to M (purple). In panel b, gene set enrichment
  analysis with the Reactome database and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is performed to
  study the G1 to S transition, showing the top 30 results ranked by adjusted p-values
  that pass FDR 0.1 cutoff (equivalent to −log padj = 1). For this, we used the function
  prerank of GSEApy. The x-axis represents the normalized enrichment score, and color
  the −log padj value. The size of the points indicates the overlap of the leading
  gene sets with the pathways. Bold color indicates common top pathways that DeDi
  found on the same networks. The pathways that explicitly mention terms related to
  the G1 to S transition are placed in green boxes. The same procedure with purple
  boxes for the G2 to M transition is displayed in panel c. Long pathway names have
  been trimmed. In panel d, we plot the average scaled and normalized expression for
  the top 20 genes in the ranking of the G1 to S transition according to each method
  (n2v2r top, DeDi bottom). The x-axis represents the cell cycle pseudotime ordering
  of the cells using Revelio. The vertical lines represent the 0.9 quantile of pseudotime
  for G1 (left, green) and G2 (right, purple, dotted) cells, acting as proxies for
  the time the transitions occur. The black curve is a 5-th order polynomial fit to
  the data. Similarly, in panel e for the G2 to M transition
