caption: The seven different expressed miRNAs validated in LACC are associated with
  inflammation-related pathways. (a) Leptin, androgen receptor, gastrin, and TGF-beta
  signaling pathways were the most enriched according to the Wikipathway database.
  (b) PDGFR-beta, IL-6, and IL-1 were the most enriched according to the Wikipathway
  cancer database. The x-axis represents the enrichment ratio
