figure_title: SFN may directly inhibit pyroptosis by impeding activation of the NLRP3
  signaling pathway.
caption: 'SFN may directly inhibit pyroptosis by impeding activation of the NLRP3
  signaling pathway. Pre-treatment of the primary peritoneal macrophages from NRF2−/−
  mice with 10 μM of SFN for 1 h, followed by infection with Mtb for 24 h at an MOI
  value of 10. (A–C) qRT-PCR analyzed the expression of NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1β mRNA
  in Mtb-infected primary peritoneal macrophages from NRF2−/− mice (n = 3); (D–H)
  WB analyzed the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, and IL-1β in Mtb-infected primary
  peritoneal macrophages from NRF2−/− mice (n = 3); (I) the Lacate Dehydrogenase (LDH)
  Activity Assay Kit was used to analyze the effects of SFN on LDH in Mtb-infected
  24 h (J) (n = 3); (J,K) Hoechst 33342/PI double staining analyzed pyroptosis in
  Mtb-infected primary peritoneal macrophages from NRF2−/− mice infected for 24 h
  (J) (100×, scale bar: 10 μm) and 72 h (K) (10×, scale bar: 100 μm) (n = 3). Means
  ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 represents significant difference'
