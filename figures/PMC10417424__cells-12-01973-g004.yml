caption: Bioinformatics analysis of functions, pathways and proteins dysregulated
  following DCUN1D1 knockdown in PCa cells (a) Enriched functions dysregulated in
  DU145 cells expressing the DCUN1D1 shRNA. (b) Top 10 pathways dysregulated following
  DCUN1D1 knockdown in DU145 prostate cancer cells. The list of genes up- and downregulated
  in DU145 cells expressing the DCUN1D1 shRNA was imported into the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis tool and canonical pathways were determined. Output represents dysregulated
  functions or pathways expressed as −log (p-value). (c) Bar chart of Panther pathway
  output from DU145 cells expressing DCUN1D1 shRNA
