figure_title: Mesenchymal Stem Cells Accelerate Recovery of Acetic Acid-Induced Chronic
  Gastric Ulcer by Regulating Ekt/Akt/TRIM29 Axis
caption: 'The hUC-MSCs may activate Erk/Akt signaling pathway via TRIM29 axis: (a)
  knocking down TRIM29 affects MSC-CM in improving cell apoptosis; (b) quantify the
  number of living cells and the total number of apoptotic cells; (c) knocking down
  TRIM29, detect the expression level of PARP and TRIM29 protein; (d) the quantitative
  results of cleaved PARP and TRIM29 protein; (e) overexpression and knockdown of
  TRIM29 in GES-1 and HGC27, detection of related protein expression'
