figure_title: KEGG pathway analysis of nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.
caption: 'KEGG pathway analysis of nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. (A) Enzymes
  in red have increased expression in the opioid specimens compared to the naïve.
  Expression of the enzymes in blue is decreased. Values are log2-transformed fold-change
  values between the opioid specimens compared with the naïve specimens. (B) Boxplots
  representing the mRNA expression of selected members of nicotinate and nicotinamide
  metabolism (AOX1: aldehyde oxidase 1; CD38; NMRK2: nicotinamide riboside kinase
  2; NNT: nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase; NT5C1B: 5′-nucleotidase, cytosolic
  IB; QPRT: quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase). * indicates that the gene is significantly
  regulated between the 2 groups (p < 0.05)'
