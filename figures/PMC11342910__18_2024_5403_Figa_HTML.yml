figure_title: (A) We quantified proteomic profiles of breast cancer cells (BCCs) and
  breast cancer-derived exosomes (BCDEs) samples from four breast cancer cell lines
  representative of common breast cancer subtypes – Her2-positive (Her2, MDA-MB-453),
  Luminal A (LA, MCF7), Luminal B (LB, ZR-75), and triple-negative (TN, MDA-MB-231).
caption: (A) We quantified proteomic profiles of breast cancer cells (BCCs) and breast
  cancer-derived exosomes (BCDEs) samples from four breast cancer cell lines representative
  of common breast cancer subtypes – Her2-positive (Her2, MDA-MB-453), Luminal A (LA,
  MCF7), Luminal B (LB, ZR-75), and triple-negative (TN, MDA-MB-231). (B) We independently
  performed four comparisons for BCCs and BCDEs, comparing each cell line against
  the remaining three. (C) We identified differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs)
  for BCCs and BCDEs, defined protein signatures, and functionally analyzed resulting
  networks. Through pathway inference analysis (PIA), we identified Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of genes and genomes (KEGG) subpaths and biological Gene Ontology (GO) terms that
  displayed differential activation. (D) We validated our proteomic signature using
  the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) databases, verified
  that differentially-activated pathways in BCDEs caused a corresponding response
  in receptor cells, and confirmed that the BCDE proteomic signature reflects their
  cell-of-origin and identifies candidate disease biomarkers in liquid biopsies
