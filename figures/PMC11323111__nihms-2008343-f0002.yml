caption: Phage Small Proteins Inhibit Host Quorum Sensing (QS). (A) In the presence
  of autoinducer, P. aeruginosa LasR upregulates the PQS biosynthetic pathway, which,
  in turn, promotes activation of genes encoding anti-phage defense systems. The consequence
  is protection of the bacterial population against phage infection. (B) The Pseudomonas
  phage small protein Aqs1 binds to and inhibits host LasR activity, which decreases
  PQS production and prevents upregulation of anti-phage defense systems, protecting
  the phage. (C) The Pseudomonas phage small protein PfsE binds to and inhibits host
  PqsA to block PQS production and enable enhanced phage virion production
