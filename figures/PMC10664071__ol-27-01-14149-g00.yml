figure_title: Identification and bioinformatics analysis of DEGs.
caption: Identification and bioinformatics analysis of DEGs. (A) Volcano plot of 235
  upregulated DEGs and 1,040 downregulated DEGs, with the gray area in the middle
  representing unchanged genes. (B) Cluster heatmap of DEGs in GSE165934. In the heatmap,
  the color gradient from green to orange represents the expression levels of DEGs,
  with green indicating lower expression levels and orange indicating higher expression
  levels. Blue denotes the control group and red denotes the asthmatic group. (C)
  Protein-protein interaction network of DEGs, where nodes represent genes (pink diamonds
  represent upregulated DEGs, gray arrowheads represent downregulated DEGs) and edges
  represent interconnectedness between genes. (D) Bar graph of GO analysis. BP enrichment
  result (pink), CC enrichment result (blue), and MF enrichment result (green). (E)
  WikiPathway analysis on 460 node genes. The larger the node, the more genes are
  enriched on this pathway. DEGs, differentially expressed genes; GO, Gene Ontology;
  BP, biological process; CC, cellular component; MF, molecular function
