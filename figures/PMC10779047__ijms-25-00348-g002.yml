figure_title: GSEA analysis of differential genes between UC and CON groups in two
  training sets.
caption: 'GSEA analysis of differential genes between UC and CON groups in two training
  sets. (A) Volcano plot representation of differential gene expression in GSE193677
  and GSE20285. The red points represent up regulated genes and the blue points represent
  down regulated genes. (B) Ridgeline plots show immune-related pathways of GSEA based
  on the RRA-sorted rank gene. (C−H) Gene set enriched in the Toll-like receptor pathway
  (NES = 2.072, FDR = 5.82 × 10−6), gene set enriched in TNF signaling (NES = 2.236,
  FDR = 4.77 × 10−9), gene set enriched in the neutrophil extracellular traps formation
  (NES = 2.061, FDR = 3.82 × 10−7), gene set enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor
  interaction (NES = 2.231,FDR = 4.13 × 10−9), gene set enriched in IL-17 signaling
  (NES = 2.665, FDR = 4.13 × 10−9), gene set enriched in Chemokine signaling pathway
  (NES = 1.989, FDR = 1.88 × 10−7). NES: normalized enrichment score'
