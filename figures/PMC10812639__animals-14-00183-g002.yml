caption: GO and KEGG Analysis of Differently Expressed Target Genes. (A) The histogram
  shows number of mRNA. Green and yellow represent total mRNAs and novel mRNAs; red
  and blue represent increased and decreased mRNA abundance. (B) GO annotation functional
  classification of differentially expressed genes. (C) KEGG pathways with significant
  enrichment of differentially expressed genes. (D–F) GO and KEGG analysis difference
  expression genes for immunity response to stimulus, biological adhesion, development
  process and cell junction
