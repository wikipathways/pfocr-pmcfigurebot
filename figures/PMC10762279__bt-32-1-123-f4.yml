figure_title: Piceamycin (PCM) induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in gemcitabine-resistant
  AsPC-1 cells.
caption: Piceamycin (PCM) induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in gemcitabine-resistant
  AsPC-1 cells. (A, B) Gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells were treated with piceamycin
  (at 0, 1, 2, and 5 μM concentration) for 24 h, stained with PI, and cell cycle arrest
  was detected by flow cytometry. All data are presented as mean ± SD (n=3, *p<0.05,
  **p<0.01, ***p<0.001). (C) Heatmap of the genes related to the cell cycle signaling
  pathway. Z-score comes from RNA-sequencing data treated with piceamycin (1.25 μM)
  for 48 h in gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells. The color represents z-score (yellow;
  positive score; upregulation, blue; negative score; downregulation). The column
  indicates z-score (–2≤z≤2) related with cell cycle signaling pathway. Normalized
  value (mRNA level) of CDK2 and Cyclin D1. All data are presented as mean ± SD (n=3).
  (D) The effect of piceamycin on the G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest was confirmed
  by observing the cell cycle regulatory proteins by western blotting. Piceamycin
  was treated with indicated concentrations in the gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells.
  α-Tubulin was used as an internal control
