caption: KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analysis of potential targets for anti-inflammatory
  improvement. The Sankey plot on the left represents the core targets included in
  each pathway, and the conventional bubble plot is on the right, where the bubble
  size indicates the number of potential targets to which the pathway belongs, and
  the bubble color indicates the p-value
