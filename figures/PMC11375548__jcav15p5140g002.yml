  the WNT pathway in melanoma.
caption: Anoectochilus roxburghii extracts inhibit the expression of METTL3 and the
  WNT pathway in melanoma. (A) This figure quantitatively depicts the gene expression
  levels of various RNA m6A modification regulators. Among them, METTL3 was significantly
  different, suggesting that Anoectochilus roxburghii extracts may specifically downregulate
  METTL3 expression. (B) Here, we compared the total RNA m^6A levels in melanoma cells,
  highlighting the impact of the extract on these epigenetic markers. (C) The diagram
  illustrates the changes in the expression levels of genes associated with the WNT
  signalling pathway, a critical pathway implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation
  and differentiation. An asterisk (*) indicates statistical significance with a p
  value of less than 0.05, underscoring that the changes in gene expression are non-random
  and could be attributed to the effects of the Anoectochilus roxburghii extracts
