figure_title: RNA-seq analyses of the MPXV-infected HaCaT cells.
caption: RNA-seq analyses of the MPXV-infected HaCaT cells. (A) The location of MPXV
  transcript in viral genome. (B) The volcano plot of DEGs regarding uninfected and
  24 h post-infected HaCaT cells (Log2 (fold change) > 1, adjusted p < 0.05). The
  red dots represent upregulated genes while the blue dots represent downregulated
  genes. (C) The heat map of DEGs, in which the genes associated with interferon and
  IL17 signaling pathways were marked. (D) KEGG analysis of the DEGs. (E) DEGs were
  categorized based on their gene ontology (GO) terms related to biological process
  (BP), cell component (CC), and molecular function (MF). (F) Gene set enrichment
  analysis of specified gene sets, including lupus erythematosus signaling pathway,
  body assembly, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and retinoid metabolism
