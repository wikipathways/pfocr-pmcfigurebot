figure_title: Ferroptosis as a vulnerability in cancer
caption: a. Therapy-resistant cancer cells with specific cellular states are vulnerable
  to ferroptosis, for example cancer cells with a mesenchymal phenotype that are enriched
  in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) owing to high expression of zinc finger E-box
  binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), elongation of very long-chain fatty acid protein 5 (ELOVL5)
  or fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1). Similarly, dedifferentiated subtypes of melanoma
  cells are characterized by PUFA accumulation and a deficiency of reduced glutathione
  (GSH), which render these cells vulnerable to ferroptosis. In addition, certain
  cancer cells, such as clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), non-neuroendocrine
  (NE) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells
  are inherently susceptible to ferroptosis owing to their unique metabolic features,
  such as high levels of PUFA-containing ether phospholipids (ePLs).b. Mutations in
  certain tumour suppressors or oncogenes render cancers vulnerable to ferroptosis.
  Inactivating mutations in any constituent of the tumour-suppressive E-cadherin–
  neurofibromin 2 (NF2)–Hippo pathway confers a vulnerability to ferroptosis by upregulating
  Yes-associated protein (YAP)- or transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif
  (TAZ)-mediated transcription of ferroptosis-promoting factors, such as acyl-coenzyme
  A synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4), transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and
  NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). In ccRCC, mutation or loss of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) promotes
  hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-dependent expression of hypoxia-inducible, lipid
  droplet-associated protein (HILPDA), rendering ccRCCs vulnerable to ferroptosis.
  Non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  mutations are vulnerable to ferroptosis because of their high dependence on cystine.
  In another example, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-mutated cancer cells with
  increased levels of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) are sensitive to
  ferroptosis owing to their decreased glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) levels. * indicates
  either a mutation or loss of the gene, dependent on the gene.c. Vulnerability to
  ferroptosis is triggered by an imbalance between GPX4-dependent and GPX4-independent
  ferroptosis defence systems. Cancer cells with low expression of components of GPX4-independent
  systems (such as ferroptosis suppressor protein-1 (FSP1), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
  (DHODH) or GTP cyclohydroxylase-1 (GCH1)) depend on GPX4 for survival and therefore
  are vulnerable to GPX4 inhibition. Conversely, cancer cells with low expression
  of GPX4 are sensitive to inactivation of components of GPX4-independent systems.
  The dashed lines indicate that the function of the indicated protein is diminished
  or blocked in the corresponding context. PLs, phospholipids.
