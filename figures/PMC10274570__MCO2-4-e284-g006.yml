caption: Targeting canonical and noncanonical signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) signaling pathways by WB737 in STAT3Mut natural killer/T‐cell lymphoma
  (NKTL). (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in NKYS cells treated
  with WB737 (50 nM) compared to control cells. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database revealed the significantly
  up‐ and downregulated pathways in NKYS cells after WB737 treatment. (C) GSEA using
  the Hallmarks pathway database showed that the Myc‐Targets‐V1 pathway was significantly
  enriched in the downregulated genes (left panel). Heatmap reveals the top 20 downregulated
  genes of Myc‐Targets‐V1 pathways in NKYS after WB737 treatment (right panel). (D)
  RT‒qPCR analysis of MYC in STAT3 Mut (NKYS, SNK6, and YT) and STAT3 WT (MEC04) cells
  treated with WB737. (E) Immunoblotting analysis of the indicated proteins in STAT3
  Mut (NKYS, SNK6, and YT) and STAT3 WT (MEC04) cells treated with WB737 for 24 h.
  (F) GSEA using the Hallmarks pathway database revealed that the oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) pathway was significantly enriched in the downregulated genes (left panel).
  The heatmap indicates the top 20 downregulated genes of the OXPHOS pathway in NKYS
  cells treated with WB737 (right panel). (G) RT‒qPCR analysis of MTND1, MTND2, MTCYB,
  MTCO3, and MTATP6 in STAT3 Mut (NKYS, SNK6, and YT) and STAT3 WT (MEC04) cells treated
  with WB737. (H) Top five significantly enriched compartments in genes related to
  the OXPHOS pathway downregulated by WB737 in NKYS. (I) Complex I activity of STAT3
  Mut (NKYS, SNK6, and YT) and STAT3 WT (MEC04) cells in the absence or presence of
  WB737. Complex I activity is normalized to the control (DMSO) and presented as the
  mean ± standard deviation (SD). (J) Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in STAT3 Mut (NKYS,
  SNK6, and YT) and STAT3 WT (MEC04) cells treated with the indicated concentrations
  of WB737. Data are representative of three independent experiments with similar
  results. Error bars represent the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  two‐tailed Student's t‐test (D, G, and I). NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR,
  false discovery rate (B, C, and F). Z‐score denotes the deviation from the mean
  by standard deviation units. Red color indicates upregulated expression, whereas
  blue color indicates downregulated expression (C and F).
