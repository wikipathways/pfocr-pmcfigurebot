figure_title: Cdc42 regulates the Pak1/JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway and inhibits TGF-β1
  autocrine signaling.
caption: Cdc42 regulates the Pak1/JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway and inhibits TGF-β1
  autocrine signaling. (A) Relative expression levels of Tgfb1 mRNA in MCFs with or
  without Cdc42 overexpression. **P<0.01 vs. NC-OE. (n=4). (B) Relative expression
  levels of Tgfb1 mRNA in MCFs with or without Cdc42 knockdown. **P<0.01 vs. siNC.
  (n=4). (C) MCFs were transfected with the Tgfb1 luciferase plasmid and siCdc42 for
  24 h, after which a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed. *P<0.05 vs. Tgfb1-luciferase
  + siNC. (n=3). (D) MCFs were divided into the NC-OE, Cdc42-OE, siNC, TGF-β1 + siNC,
  siCdc42-1 and siCdc42-2 groups, and representative immunoblots showing changes in
  Cdc42, Pak1, JNK, c-Jun, TGF-β1 and GAPDH expression in the cells are presented.
  (E) Quantification analysis of each protein level of NC-OE and Cdc42-OE groups.
  *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. NC-OE. (F) Quantification of each protein level of siNC,
  TGF-β1 + siNC, siCdc42-1 and siCdc42-2 groups. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. siNC (repeats,
  n=2; replicates, n=3). TGF-β1 + siNC group received TGF-β1 treatment. This group
  was used as a control for the siCdc42-1 and siCdc42-2 groups to observe whether
  Cdc42 silencing had the same effect as TGF-β1 treatment. The data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant
  difference. Cdc42, cell division cycle 42; Luc, luciferase; MCF, mouse cardiac fibroblast;
  NC, negative control; OE, overexpression; Pak1, p21 (RAC1)-activated kinase 1; siCdc42,
  small interfering RNA targeting Cdc42; siNC, negative control small interfering
  RNA
