figure_title: Disease-specific alterations in the nucleoside metabolism.
caption: 'Disease-specific alterations in the nucleoside metabolism. (A) Heatmap of
  the detectable nucleosides and their metabolites in liver tissues 7 weeks after
  induction of ASH or NASH. Data are shown as fold changes compared to healthy mice
  (n = 8). Student’s t-test vs. healthy mice, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  **** p < 0.0001. (B,C) Schematic illustration of the purine (panel B) and pyrimidine
  (panel C) nucleoside metabolic pathways. Metabolites in the dashed and continuous
  boxes are regulated in ASH and NASH, respectively. Metabolites shown in blue are
  significantly downregulated, whereas metabolites in red are significantly upregulated.
  Metabolites indicated in black show no significant changes and metabolites in grey
  were not detected. (D–F) Levels of ascorbic acid (panel D), ascorbic acid 2-sulfate
  (panel E) and reduced glutathione (panel F) in liver tissue from healthy mice and
  mice with induced ASH or NASH after 7 weeks. Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 8).
  One-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
  IMP: inosine monophosphate; UMP: uridine monophosphate'
