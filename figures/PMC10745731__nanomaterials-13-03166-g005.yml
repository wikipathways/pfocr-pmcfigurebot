caption: 'Increased protein expression of important players of the NF-κB pathway in
  the liver of animals with low-grade persistent inflammatory state at 7 weeks after
  intravenously injected PEI-MNP. Experimental groups: “+/+”: animals with low-grade
  persistent inflammation state (subcutaneous injection of zymosan, 3 times 18 µg/kg
  body weight) and with intravenous injection of PEI-MNPs (50 µmol Fe/kg body weight,
  700 µg PEI per mg iron); “−/−”: animals without low-grade persistent inflammation
  state and without intravenous injection of PEI-MNPs; “−/+”: animals without low-grade
  persistent inflammation state but with intravenous injection of PEI-MNP. Protein
  expression normalized to the housekeeping cellular protein β-actin. NF-κB nuclear
  factors in red, regulators in green and effector proteins in blue. Data are plotted
  as mean and standard deviation of the mean, n = 5 animals per group. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 (Mann–Whitney U test)'
