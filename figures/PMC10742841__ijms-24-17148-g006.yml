figure_title: Comparison of the Metabolomics of Different Dendrobium Species by UPLC-QTOF-MS
caption: 'The key differential metabolites of DN and different species of Dendrobium
  were mapped to metabolic pathways, and the results of metabolic pathway analysis
  are shown as KEGG pathway results: (A,D) galactose metabolism; (B,F) flavonoid biosynthesis;
  (C) cysteine and methionine metabolism; (E) flavone and flavonol biosynthesis'
