figure_title: iMSC and iAAT-MSC modulate oxidative stress and regulate mitochondrial
  respiration and glycolysis
caption: '(A-C) iMSC and iAAT-MSC modulate oxidative stress and regulate mitochondrial
  respiration and glycolysis. (A-C) Total mRNA from TNBS treated-AR42J cells in all
  groups was analyzed by qRT-PCR for the major molecules in the apoptosis signaling
  pathway: (A-B) Chop, p53, Bcl-2, Bip; and (C) ZO-1. Expression is presented as a
  ratio of cytokine/GAPDH. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 vs. TNBS group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001,
  ####P < 0.0001 vs. CTR group; SP < 0.05, SSSP < 0.001, SSSSP < 0.0001 vs. iMSC group.
  (D-G) After 24h, AR42J cells were co-cultured with iMSCs or iAAT-MSCs, treated with
  TNBS at 0.15% concentration for another 24h, and the dynamics of OCR and ECAR were
  measured. (D) Graphical representation of the OCR measurement over time; A respiratory
  function stress test was carried out using sequential additions of oligomycin (Oligo,
  5 µM), FCCP (5 µM), and rotenone/antimycin A combined (Rot/AA, 2.5 µM) injected
  seque€ally. (E) The effects of co-culture with iMSCs and iAAT-MSCs on the ATP-linked
  OCR and spare respiratory capacity-linked OCR were calculated from the OCR curves.
  Data presented as the mean ± standard deviation. *P<0.05; **P<0.01. (F) Graphical
  representation of the ECAR measurement over time; A glycolytic function stress test
  was carried out using sequential additions of Glucose (10 mM), oligomycin (Oligo,
  5 µM), and 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG, 50 mM). (G) The effects of co-culture with iMSCs
  and iAAT-MSCs on the glycolytic capacity-linked ECAR and glycolytic reserve-linked
  ECAR calculated from the ECAR curves'
