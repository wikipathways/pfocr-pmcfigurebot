caption: Therapeutic effects of propionate in SS. Propionate (200 mg/kg) was administered
  intraperitoneally to 12-week-old NOD mice, which were monitored for 24 weeks. Salivary
  glands and the spleen were harvested. A Saliva flow rate at 12, 16, 19, and 23 weeks.
  B Salivary glands were stained with H&E. Bar graphs show the histological score
  (left) and inflammation area (right). C Salivary gland tissue stained for IL-6,
  IL-17, and TNF-α and numbers of cells positive for IL-6 (left), IL-17 (center),
  and TNF-α (right). D Salivary glands were visualized by confocal microscopy. Representative
  images of Th17 (CD4+IL-17+; top) and Treg (CD4+CD25+FOXP3.+; bottom) cells are shown.
  Bar graphs show numbers of Th17- and Treg-positive cells. Data are means ± SD (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.001)
