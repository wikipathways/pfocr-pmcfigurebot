caption: IL17RB signaling may contribute to acamprosate treatment response. (A) A
  schematic outline of the IL17RB signaling pathway. (B) Basal mRNA expression levels
  of IL17RB were negatively correlated with the expression of TRAF6, TRAF3IP2 (also
  known as ACT1) and several NF-κB subunits. (C) IL17RB mRNA expression was significantly
  lower in AUD patients who relapsed to alcohol use during three months of acamprosate
  treatment. In contrast, the mRNA expression of TRAF6, TRAF3IP2, and NF-κB subunits
  (NFκB1, RELA, RELB, REL) in the relapse group were significantly higher than those
  observed in the non-relapse group. *p < 0.05
