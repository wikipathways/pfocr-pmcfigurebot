figure_title: The tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 is required for Mdm2-mediated GKR2
  ubiquitination upon the stimulation of the D2R β-arrestin-dependent pathway.
caption: The tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK2 is required for Mdm2-mediated GKR2 ubiquitination
  upon the stimulation of the D2R β-arrestin-dependent pathway. (A) HEK 293 cells
  were transfected with plasmids encoding [βarr]D2R, GRK2, and FLAG-Mdm2. The pretreatment
  of cells with 10 μM PP2 for 30 min was followed by a 2-min treatment with 10 μM
  DA. The immunoprecipitation of cell lysates using FLAG beads. Co-IP/Lysate and IP
  were immunoblotted, respectively, with antibodies against GRK2 (1:2000) and FLAG
  (1:1000). (B) HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding [βarr]D2R, HA-Ub,
  and FLAG-GRK2. Cells were pretreated with 10 μM PP2 for 30 min, followed by 10 μM
  DA treatment for 2 min. The immunoprecipitation of cell lysates using FLAG beads.
  Co-IP/Lysate and IP were immunoblotted, respectively, with antibodies against HA
  (1:1000 dilution) and FLAG (1:1000 dilution). ** p < 0.01 compared with the Veh
  group (n = 3). (C) HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding [βarr]D2R,
  HA-Ub, and FLAG-GRK2-WT or FLAG-GRK2-3YF. The cells were treated with either a vehicle
  or 10 μM DA for 2 min. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates using FLAG beads. Co-IP/Lysate
  and IP were immunoblotted with antibodies against HA (1:1000 dilution) and FLAG
  (1:1000 dilution), respectively. ** p < 0.01 compared with the Veh group (n = 3).
  (D) HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding [βarr]D2R, HA-Src, and
  FLAG-GRK2-WT or FLAG-GRK2-4KR. Cells were treated with either a vehicle or 10 μM
  DA for 2 min. The immunoprecipitation of cell lysates using FLAG beads. HA (1:1000
  dilution) and FLAG (1:1000 dilution) antibodies were used to immunoblot Co-IP/Lysate
  and IP, respectively. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared with corresponding Veh
  group (n = 3). (E) GRK2-KD cells producing [βarr]D2R were transfected with plasmids
  encoding GRK2-WT or GRK2-3YF. Serum-starved cells were incubated in the presence
  of 10 μM DA for 10 min. Antibodies against p-ERK1/2 (1:1000 dilution) and ERK2 (1:1000
  dilution) were used to immunoblot lysates. ** p < 0.01 compared with the corresponding
  Veh/WT group (n = 3)
