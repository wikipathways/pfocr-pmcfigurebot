caption: Cellular senescence pathways affected by Tax. Schematic representation of
  different physiological processes associated with induction of cellular senescence.
  While cellular division is associated with telomere shortening and replicative senescence,
  Tax can reactivate hTERT expression and stimulate its activity. These effects are
  sufficient to prevent telomere-induced foci (TIF) and activation of the DDR. Tax
  expression is associated with rapid cell proliferation and various metabolic stress
  progression, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In turn, ROS
  induces DNA damage and activation of ATM/p53 response. Tax expression impairs DNA
  replication fork, resulting in stalling and fallout, creating an accumulation of
  double DNA strand breaks and activation of the DDR. Activation of the DDR can stimulate
  ATM/p53 or p16INK pathways, leading to irreversible cellular senescence
