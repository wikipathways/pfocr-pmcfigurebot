caption: Mechanism by which p53 promotes the apoptosis of human colon cancer cell
  lines by releasing and transferring AIF into the nucleus after the formation of
  the PAR polymer. This death signaling pathway is inhibited by p53 deletion or mutation
  and protective autophagy is increased by inhibition of AKT. *1, No binding between
  PAR and AIF; *2, binding between PAR and AIF [AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; AKT,
  protein kinase B; NAD, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; p53, protein-53; PAR,
  poly (ADP-ribose); PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase]
