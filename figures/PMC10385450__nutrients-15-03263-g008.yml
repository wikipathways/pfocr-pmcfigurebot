figure_title: SIRT1/NF-κB and SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway in the placenta.
caption: 'SIRT1/NF-κB and SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway in the placenta. (A) The protein
  expression of SIRT1. (B) The protein expression of the SIRT1/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (C) The protein expression of the SIRT1/ Nrf2 signaling pathway. Data are represented
  as means ± SD (n = 3). A significant difference (p < 0.05) is denoted by different
  letters: a vs. the CON group; b vs. the FA group; c vs. the HFD group'
