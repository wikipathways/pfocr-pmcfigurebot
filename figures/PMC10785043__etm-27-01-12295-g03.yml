caption: Butorphanol inhibits ferroptosis by blocking the JNK/p38 signaling pathway.
  (A) Expression levels of the JNK/p38 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected
  using western blotting. (B) Expression levels of TBARS were detected using the corresponding
  assay kit. (C) Levels of Fe2+ were detected using the iron colorimetric assay kit.
  (D and E) The expression levels of the ferroptosis-related proteins were detected
  using western blotting analysis. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal
  kinase; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances; p-, phosphorylated; t-,
  total; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; FTH1, ferritin heavy chain 1; ACSL4, long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA
  ligase 4
