  macrophages.
caption: 'The Hippo signaling pathway is suppressed in fibrotic kidney-derived macrophages.
  (a) KEGG enrichment pathway bubble diagram of macrophages derived from the spleen
  and IRI (n = 3). (b) Heatmaps from RNA-seq analysis showing differentially expressed
  genes in CD115 magnetic bead-sorted monocytes/macrophages from fibrotic kidneys
  after IRI (n = 3). The expression of Yap, Taz, and Tead in the Hippo signaling pathway
  was significantly increased. (c) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the Hippo
  signaling pathway in IRI model mice kidneys. (d–k) The mRNA abundance of Yap1 (d),
  Taz (e), Tead1-4 (f–i), ANKRD1 (j), and CTGF (k). (l) Western blotting showing the
  expression level of Mst1, Yap, Taz, and Tead1 in CD115 magnetic bead-sorted monocytes/macrophages
  from fibrotic kidneys after IRI. (m, n) Representative immunofluorescence images
  (left) and quantitative analysis (right) showing the induction of Tead1 or Taz in
  F4/80-positive macrophages within the fibrotic kidneys after IRI (n = 5; scale bar,
  100 μm). Each point represents the analysis from a randomly selected visual field
  within a biological sample. CTL, control; IRI, ischemia–reperfusion injury; #p <
  0.05. The data are presented as the means ± SDs'
