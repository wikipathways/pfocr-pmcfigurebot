figure_title: Neuroprotective effects of KBs and KD by providing energy source and
  improving mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain.
caption: Neuroprotective effects of KBs and KD by providing energy source and improving
  mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain. (A) KBs serve as energy fuel for the brain.
  KBs promote ATP production by decreasing the NAD+/NADH ratio and increasing the
  coenzyme Q/QH2 ratio and ΔG’ of ATP hydrolysis. KBs exert neuroprotective effects
  through its use as an energy fuel. (B) KBs exert beneficial effects by improving
  mitochondrial function. KBs and KD improve mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing
  mitochondrial biogenesis through SIRT1/2/3, AMPK, PGC1α, and FOXO1/3a pathways after
  increasing NAD+ production. KBs and KD also increase mitochondrial respiration through
  PGC1α, complex I/II. The signaling pathways mediated by KBs and KD improve mitochondrial
  quality control and increase ATP production, resulting in neuroprotection. All arrows
  indicate activation
