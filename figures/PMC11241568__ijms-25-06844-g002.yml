figure_title: 'Effects of IL-7 and TLSP on the JAK–STAT signaling pathway and the
  action of selected inhibitors of pathway components: IL-7 leads to the activation
  of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3, as well as STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, which are translocated
  to the cell nucleus, regulating gene expression.'
caption: 'Effects of IL-7 and TLSP on the JAK–STAT signaling pathway and the action
  of selected inhibitors of pathway components: IL-7 leads to the activation of Janus
  kinases JAK1 and JAK3, as well as STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, which are translocated
  to the cell nucleus, regulating gene expression. TSLP, through heterodimerization
  of IL-7α with CRLF2, activates JAK1 and JAK2, as well as the effector STAT5, which
  translocate to the cell nucleus and influences gene expression. Fludarabine is an
  inhibitor of STAT1, while ruxolitinib and fedratinib are JAK2 inhibitors. By preventing
  the activation of their target molecules, these drugs exert inhibitory effects on
  the JAK–STAT pathway'
