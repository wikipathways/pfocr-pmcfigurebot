caption: A schematic representation of the TIA pathway. Enzyme abbreviations are written
  in capital letters next to the arrow, indicating the reaction that was catalyzed
  by each enzyme. Red colored enzymes are up-regulated by either, or both, ORCA2 and
  ORCA3. The inhibition of the enzyme by CR1 are directly indicated. The metabolites
  resulting from different enzymatic conversions are indicated by the appropriate
  arrows. The solid arrows represent single enzymatic conversions, whereas dashed
  arrows indicate multiple-step or uncharacterized enzymatic conversions. AsÎ± (anthranilate
  synthase); TDC (tryptophan decarboxylase); CPR (cytochrome P450 reductase); G10H
  (geraniol 10-hydroxylase); STR (strictosidine synthase); T16H (tabersonine 16-hydroxylase);
  MAT (minovincinine-19-O-acetyltransferase); D4H (desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase);
  DAT (deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase); and PRX1 (vacuolar class III peroxidase)
