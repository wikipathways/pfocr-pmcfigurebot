figure_title: Correlation-based network pathway
caption: (A) The CB1R structure bound with 5F-MDMB-PICA with final correlated pairs
  mapped on the structure. The green pairs are representative pairs for 5F-MDMB-PICA
  and the yellow pairs are representative for 5F-MMB-PICA. There is a noticeable difference
  between these two ligands signaling pathway. The CB1R/5F-MDMB-PICA network includes
  a pathway consisting of eight strongly correlated pairs (solid green lines) which
  connect the E1331.49-L3997.55 (TM1i – TM7i) changes to the changes at the extracellular-middle
  domain, F1742.61-D1762.63 (TM2m – TM2e), the intracellular domain, A1602.47-A3987.54
  (TM2i – TM7i), H1431.59-F408H8 (TM1i – H8), T3446.36-L3997.55 (TM6i – TM7i), H406H8-R409H8
  (H8 – H8), and the changes between the intracellular domain and Gα,T313ICL3-S265Gα
  (ICL3 – Gα), T313 ICL3-E318Gα (ICL3 – Gα), and R4007.56- K349Gα (TM7i – Gα). E1331.49-L3997.55
  (TM1i – TM7i) is at the core of these correlated pairs. There is no such pathway
  for CB1R/5F-MMB-PICA. (B) The TM2e key residue H1782.65 contributes to the 5F-MDMB-PICA
  signaling pathway. (C) The TM2i residue (F1552.42) and TM7i NPxxY residues (P3947.50
  and Y3977.53) are unique to 5F-MDMB-PICA network pathway
