figure_title: ß-oxidation pathway for fatty acids is strongly downregulated by oxaliplatin
caption: 'Abbreviations: ACAT1, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (Acat1), ACSL1, acyl-CoA
  synthetase long chain family member 1 (Acsl1); CACT, Carnitine acylcarnitine translocase
  (Slc25a20); CPT1B, Carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1b); CPT2, Carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase
  2 (Cpt2); ECHS1, enoyl-CoA hydratase, short chain 1 (Echs1); HADH, hydroxyacyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase (Hadh); HADHA, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase alpha and beta subunits
  of the mitochondrial trifunction protein complex (Hadha and Hadhb); H-FABP, heart
  fatty acid binding protein (Fabp3); LCAD, long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (Acadl);
  MCAD, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadm); MTP, mitochondrial trifunction
  protein complex; SCAD, small chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acads); VLCAD, very long
  chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (Acadvl); VDAC, voltage dependent ion channels (Vdac1,
  Vdac2, or Vdac3). The pathway is derived from the KEGG database. Blue – upregulated
