figure_title: Nrf2 signalling pathway.
caption: Nrf2 signalling pathway. In the normal condition, the complex of Nrf2–Keap1–CUL3
  is degraded via the proteasomal pathway. Upon exposure to stress, Nrf2 is dissociated
  from the complex and freely moves into the nucleus to form a heterodimer with sMAFs.
  Upon binding to MARE, it initiates the transcription of antioxidant signalling
