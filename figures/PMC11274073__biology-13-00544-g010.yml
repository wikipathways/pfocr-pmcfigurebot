caption: Key targets GO/KEGG enrichment analysis and molecular docking. (a) GO function
  enrichment analysis. (b) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. (c) Heatmap of molecular
  docking. They are elemicin-TYK2 methyl eugenol-PARP1, methyl eugenol-JAK2, and methyl
  eugenol-TYK2. (d) Structure of molecular docking (Vina score is ≤−5.0 kcal/mol,
  the molecular binding is relatively stable, Vina score is ≤−7.0 kcal/mol, and the
  molecular binding is highly stable)
