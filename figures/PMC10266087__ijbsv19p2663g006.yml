caption: Identification of the signaling pathway mediating the effects of MCP-EV-delivered
  Hebp1 in CNI-induced ED mice. (A) Heatmap of log2-normalized intensities of significantly
  differentially expressed genes in Signaling Explorer Antibody Arrays from sham-operated
  and CNI-induced ED mice that received two intracavernous injections (administered
  on days -3 and 0) of shHebp1 MCP-EVs (10 µg per mouse in 20 µl PBS), shCon MCP-EVs
  (10 µg per mouse in 20 µl PBS), or PBS only. Color density shows fold-changes, with
  different multiples indicated by different colors. Red, up-regulated; blue, down-regulated.
  (B) Proteins significantly regulated by MCP-EV-delivered Hebp1 in CNI-induced ED
  mice, identified by a PPI network of differentially expressed genes. The thickness
  of lines corresponds to the strength of the interaction between the proteins. Red
  box highlights claudin family genes. (C) Representative Western blots for claudin
  -1, -2, -3, and -11 in CC tissue from the indicated groups. (D) Ox-LDL (green) immunostaining
  in CC tissues from the indicated groups. Nuclei were labeled with the DNA dye DAPI
  (blue). Scale bar, 100 µm. (E-I) Expression of the indicated proteins, quantified
  by densitometric analysis of the corresponding protein bands, and Ox-LDL immunopositive
  areas, determined using an image analyzer. Results are presented as means ± SEM
  (n = 4; *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001). The relative ratio of the sham operation group
  was defined as 1. ED, erectile dysfunction; MCPs, mouse cavernous pericytes; EVs,
  extracellular vesicles; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ox-LDL, oxidized low-density
  lipoprotein; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ns, not significant
