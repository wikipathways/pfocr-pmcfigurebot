caption: Hormone regulatory pathways change during seed germination. Analysis of metabolite
  accumulation in hormone metabolism pathway shows that red indicates up-regulation
  and enrichment, and green indicates down-regulation and enrichment. The column chart
  shows some differentially expressed genes in the pathway, with the gene name in
  italic font
