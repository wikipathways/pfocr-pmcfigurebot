caption: The changes in the expression of key proteins of NF-κB signaling pathway
  after LPS stimulation at different concentrations and P-NF-κB p65 cellular localization.
  (A) Effects of 0, 1, 5 and 10 μg/mL LPS on TLR4, Myd88, P-NF-κB p65, P-IκBα, NF-κB
  p65, IκBα protein expression of RECs; (B–E) the gray analysis of TLR4, Myd88, P-NF-κB
  p65, P-IκBα; (F) effect of 6 h and 10 μg/mL LPS on P-NF-κB p65 cellular localization
  in RECs. The red light represents P-NF-κB p65, and the blue light represents the
  nucleus. ** p < 0.01, * was compared to 0 μg/mL group. N = 5 in each group
