caption: The therapeutic mechanism of polyphenols for anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorder
  is caused by extrinsic stress, with decreased Nrf2 expression leading to reduced
  antioxidant capacity and elevated ROS. Meanwhile, elevated CORT causes neuroinflammation
  and dysfunctional monoamine neurotransmitter secretion in the brain. Grape seed
  extract inhibits the release of MDA, ROS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, and promotes the secretion
  of 5-HT and BDNF. Curcumin enhances the activity of antioxidant enzymes to decrease
  the levels of ROS. Chlorogenic acids activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway to decrease
  the levels of ROS
