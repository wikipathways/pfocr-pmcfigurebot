caption: 'Expression levels of genes in anthocyanin-biosynthesis-related pathways
  in Syn-treated VR cells: PAL, C4H, and 4CL in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway;
  CHS, CHI, F3’H, F3’5’H, F3H, DFR, and LDOX in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway;
  and mybA1 and UFGT in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. VR cells were cultured
  in a medium containing 5 mM Syn for 120 h (27 °C, 54.2 μmol m−2 s−1/16 h/day). Gene
  expression level was estimated by real-time RT-PCR. Data are expression levels relative
  to actin and are shown as means ± S.E. of four biological replicates (n = 4). *
  and ** indicate significant differences at p < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively (t-test)'
