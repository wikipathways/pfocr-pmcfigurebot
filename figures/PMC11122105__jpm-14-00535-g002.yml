figure_title: JAK–STAT signaling pathway in psoriasis.
caption: JAK–STAT signaling pathway in psoriasis. Consequent to cytokines and growth
  factors binding to receptors, JAK is recruited and phosphorylated, an event that
  leads to receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the development of a binding site
  for STAT. After STAT phosphorylation, the receptor unlocks and forms a dimer that
  penetrates the nucleus, attaches to DNA, and directs transcription with further
  increased proliferation and decreased differentiation of keratinocytes. JAK—Janus
  Kinase; STAT—Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription
