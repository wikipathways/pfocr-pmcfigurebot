figure_title: Proteomic profiling of control and Eprs1 cKO hearts at the early stage.
caption: 'Proteomic profiling of control and Eprs1 cKO hearts at the early stage.
  (A) The dot plot shows mass spectrometry analysis of proteomic changes at the protein
  steady-state level in control (aMHCMCM) and Eprs1 cKO hearts at 2 weeks post-tamoxifen
  injection. The cutoff was set as |Log2FC (cKO/Ctrl)| > 1 or p < 0.05, and red dots
  indicate downregulated proteins and green dots for upregulated proteins (yellow
  dots for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases). Purple dots represent significantly downregulated
  proteins encoding lipid and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. (B) Gene ontology
  analysis of downregulated protein and upregulated proteins for biological process
  enrichment. Top GO terms are included, and redundant pathways are removed. (C) Protein
  expression changes of cytosolic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as indicated by mass
  spectrometry analysis. (D) Western blot confirmed the upregulation of tRNA aminoacylation
  synthetases and activation of ISR in the Eprs1 cKO hearts. Ctrl: aMHCMCM 4 weeks
  post-tamoxifen injection. The quantification data are shown on the right panel.
  (E) Protein expression changes in mitochondrial fatty acid and branched-chain amino
  acid-related metabolic enzymes as indicated by mass spectrometry analysis. (F) Western
  blot confirmed the downregulation of BCAA metabolic enzyme and fatty acid beta-oxidation
  enzymes in the Eprs1 cKO hearts. Ctrl: aMHCMCM 4 weeks post-tamoxifen injection.
  The quantification data are shown on the right panel. (G) mTOR signaling pathway
  was activated in the Eprs1 cKO hearts. Ctrl: aMHCMCM 4 weeks post-tamoxifen injection.
  The quantification of p-mTOR/mTOR and p-P70S6K/P70S6K ratios are shown as bar graphs.
  Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Comparisons were performed by One-way ANOVA
  with Turkey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test for (D,F,G). NS, not significant;
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001'
