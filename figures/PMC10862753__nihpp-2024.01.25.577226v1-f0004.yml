figure_title: Genes associated with angiogenesis and cell fate are enriched in HCM
  endothelial cell clusters
caption: 'A) UMAP embedding of reiterative clustering of endothelial cells. B) Bar
  plot depicting proportion of major cell types of interest within control subjects
  (C1 and C2) and HCM subjects (H1, H2, and H3) and proportions in pooled cohorts
  (Control vs HCM). C) Left: Embedding derived from Milo k-nearest neighborhood differential
  abundance testing and layout derived from UMAP embedding. Nodes with false discovery
  rate <10% depict neighborhoods and are colored by log fold changes for HCM (blue)
  versus control (red) samples. Right: Beeswarm plot depicting significant log fold
  changes for HCM (blue) and control (red) neighborhoods derived from differential
  abundance testing stratified by cardiomyocyte clusters (y-axis). D) Heatmap exhibiting
  differentially expressed genes for each of the EC clusters. Expression levels indicate
  the average expression for each cluster. Clusters are colored according to Figure
  4A. E) Violin plot illustrating relative expression for RGCC and NOTCH4 in HCM versus
  control cells. F) Enrichment map stratified by EC cluster depicting the proportional
  GO pathway analysis. Node size is determined by the number of genes within each
  GO pathway. Node size is determined by the number of genes within each GO pathway'
