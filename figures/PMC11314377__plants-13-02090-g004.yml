figure_title: Metabolic pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes from
  the transcriptome of the B03S leaf sheath.
caption: Metabolic pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes from the
  transcriptome of the B03S leaf sheath. (A) Metabolic pathways of the differentially
  expressed genes in the 4-DAT leaf sheath. (B) Primary metabolic pathways of the
  differentially expressed genes in the 5-DAT leaf sheath. The arrow indicates metabolites
  related to glycometabolism and hormone-related pathways. The percentage indicates
  the proportion of differentially expressed genes in the pathway relative to the
  total number of differentially expressed genes
