figure_title: Potential biological pathways altered in WCB cells from OSA-affected
  mothers identified by microarray analysis.
caption: 'Potential biological pathways altered in WCB cells from OSA-affected mothers
  identified by microarray analysis. (a) Enrichment analysis of gene sets in the GO
  (Gene Ontology) database (GO-GSEA). For functional enrichment, “keywords” (pathologies
  and signaling pathways) associated with OSA were introduced. Significant positive
  NES (normalized enrichment scores) value indicates that members of a given gene
  set tend to appear at the top of the ranked transcriptome data. (b) The analysis
  after filtering by keywords showed 23 entries represented by the small squares,
  which were grouped into five main clusters: placenta development, response to insulin,
  response to oxidative stress, positive regulation of programmed cell death, and
  leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cell'
