figure_title: Transcriptomics analysis of FDT on atherosclerosis.
caption: Transcriptomics analysis of FDT on atherosclerosis. (A) Volcano plot of differential
  expression genes between model and FDT groups. There are 33 upregulated genes and
  66 downregulated genes. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment of differential expression genes
  between Model and FDT group. (C) Joint analysis of the differential expression genes
  (Model vs. FDT) and potential targets from network pharmacology. The purple circles
  represent the DEGs (Model vs. FDT) from transcriptomics. SELP and CCL2 were verified
  by transcriptomics. (D) SELP and (E) CCL2 mRNA level in ApoE−/− mice. Data are expressed
  as mean ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
