figure_title: Frequency of proliferation-altering disruptions in enhancers, HARs,
  and HGEs
caption: '(A) The number of disrupted conserved regions leading to a proliferation
  phenotype within each enhancer (left, shown in gray) or in each HAR or HGE (right,
  shown in red).(B) The proportion of proliferation-altering disruptions compared
  with all targeted sites in all enhancers (gray) and HARs or HGEs (red). The dashed
  line indicates the mean density of proliferation phenotypes within all enhancers
  in the screen.(C) The total number of conserved regions disrupted within each enhancer
  (x axis) compared with the cumulative proliferation phenotype burden within each
  enhancer (y axis). Mutation-sensitive enhancers identified by permutation analysis
  (see D and main text for details) are labeled based on the most proximal gene. HARs
  and HGEs are labeled in red. The results of the permutation analysis, including
  the number of disrupted sites with a phenotype compared with the total number of
  targeted sites and the enrichment p values, are provided in Table S11.(D) A mutation-sensitive
  enhancer near SPRY2, a regulator of the FGF signaling pathway. Top: genomic coordinates
  indicate position on the reference genome (GRCh37/hg19). Three enhancers (i, ii,
  and iii), shown by the extent of H3K27ac marking (light blue bars) in hNSCs, were
  disrupted in this locus. Enhancer iii includes a significant excess of proliferation-altering
  enhancer disruptions. Bottom: H3K27ac signal profile (light blue), mammalian PhastCons
  elements (orange bars), and corresponding conserved regions that have either neutral
  effects (gray bars) or proliferation-decreasing phenotypes (dark blue bars) when
  disrupted in the screen are shown for enhancer iii. The signal track at the bottom
  displays normalized beta scores (gray) at 12 cell divisions averaged across a sliding
  window'
