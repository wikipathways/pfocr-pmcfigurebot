caption: Pathway analysis of the genes with altered expression in the mouse dorsal
  skin. Data obtained from KEGG pathway analysis using the DAVID tool were categorized
  into inflammation, muscle contraction, vasodilation, hair, insulin, detoxification,
  and others, and the number of pathways were counted and graphed. WO, whale oil;
  MXD, minoxidil
