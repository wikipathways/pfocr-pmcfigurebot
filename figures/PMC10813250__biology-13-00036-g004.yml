caption: Red ginseng uptake for 14 weeks downregulates the hepatic JNK/NF-kB signaling
  pathway in aged mice. Liver tissues were collected from Control and RG-fed mice
  after 14-week interventions and immunoblotted with inflammation-related antibodies.
  (A) The immunoblots were quantified by normalizing p-JNK and JNK to β-actin and
  p-JNK to total JNK. (B) The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were fractionated
  from the mouse liver tissues. The quantification of immunoblots was performed by
  the normalization of nuclear p65 to HDAC1, and cytoplasmic p65 to β-tubulin. Student’s
  t-test was used to quantify the immunoblots. The results are presented as mean ±
  SEM. (* p < 0.05)
