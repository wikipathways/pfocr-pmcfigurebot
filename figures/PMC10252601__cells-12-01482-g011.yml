figure_title: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) reprograms vein transcriptomes and upregulates
  MYCN, AP1, and 11 other transcription factors.
caption: 'Chronic kidney disease (CKD) reprograms vein transcriptomes and upregulates
  MYCN, AP1, and 11 other transcription factors. The gene expression changes of transcription
  factors (TFs) in the veins of CKD patients were compared to those of non-CKD controls.
  The 1496 TFs were collected from the HPA (https://www.proteinatlas.org/search/protein_class:Transcription+factors,
  accessed on 17 February 2023). (A) CKD modulates the gene expression changes of
  50 TFs with 13 upregulated genes and 37 downregulated genes in the vein of CKD patients
  (see Supplementary Table S14). (B) Metascape pathway analysis showed the top pathways
  of the 13 CKD-upregulated TFs. (C) CKD upregulated 10 AP-1 target genes, which were
  collected from the MotifMap dataset: https://maayanlab.cloud/Harmonizome/gene_set/AP-1/MotifMap+Predicted+Transcription+Factor+Targets,
  accessed on 17 February 2023. (D) Metascape pathway analysis revealed the top pathways
  of the 10 CKD-upregulated AP-1 target genes. (E) CKD upregulated 42 MYC target genes,
  which were collected from the MotifMap dataset https://maayanlab.cloud/Harmonizome/gene_set/MYC/CHEA+Transcription+Factor+Targets,
  accessed on 17 February 2023. (F) Metascape pathway analysis revealed the top pathways
  of the 42 CKD-upregulated MYC target genes. (G) A schematic diagram shows the prograde
  and retrograde signaling between the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles'
