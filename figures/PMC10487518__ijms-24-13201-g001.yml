caption: Phytochrome signaling pathway in adaptation to diverse stresses. The transition
  between the activated (Pfr) and inactivated (Pr) forms of the phytochromes can be
  realized through changes in external light quality (R/FR), in which Pfr can enter
  the nucleus to activate or inhibit HY5 (Elongated hypocotyl 5), HFR1 (Hypocotyl
  in far-red 1), COP1 (Constitutively photomorphogenic1), SPAs (Suppressor of phyA),
  PIFs (Phytochrome interacting factors), etc., to cope with plant responses to drought,
  high temperature, chilling, freezing, saline-alkali soil, plant disease, and pests
