figure_title: Overview of the RIPK3-CaMKII-mPTP signaling pathway.
caption: Overview of the RIPK3-CaMKII-mPTP signaling pathway. When TNF-α binds to
  TNFR1, TNFR1 recruits the adaptor protein TRADD, which recruits other proteins to
  form complex I. When RIPK1 is deubiquitinated and activated, RIPK1 assembles a cytoplasmic
  signaling complex that includes RIPK3, FADD, caspase8 and TRADD. Under conditions
  of impaired caspase8 activity, RIPK1 self-phosphorylation promotes the phosphorylation
  and activation of RIPK3, thereby mediating the phosphorylation and activation of
  MLKL, which is subsequently oligomerized and transported to the plasma membrane,
  ultimately leading to the occurrence of necroptosis. In addition, p-RIPK3 can also
  activate CaMKII. When CaMKII is activated, it causes ER stress, which then leads
  to Ca2+ leakage. Excess Ca2+ in the cytoplasm enters the mitochondria via the MCU,
  leading to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, promoting the opening of mPTP, which leads
  to the loss of ΔΨm and reduced ATP synthesis, and ultimately leads to necroptosis.
