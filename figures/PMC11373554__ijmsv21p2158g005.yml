caption: MetaCore pathway analysis of the coexpression gene network involving KDM1A
  in pancreatic cancer. We extracted the top 1000 genes coexpressed with KDM1A from
  the TCGA database. We conducted a pathway analysis and generated a pathway list
  ordered by the -log p value. The "Ephrin receptors pathway" ranked highest in the
  biological process category. The figure illustrates interactions between genes and
  proteins, with symbols representing proteins and arrows depicting protein interactions
  (green for activation, red for inhibition)
