  YAP1.
caption: Crosstalk of Hippo signal pathway with other signaling pathways to regulate
  YAP1. When Hippo signaling is active, MST1/2 kinase phosphorylates the SAV1 complex,
  which then activates LATS1/2 and its regulatory protein MOB1/2 complex. Subsequently,
  LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP1 at a highly conserved residue within a specific sequence.
  Phosphorylation at Ser-127 promotes cytoplasmic retention of YAP1, while phosphorylation
  at Ser-397 induces degradation. In the absence of Hippo pathway activity, YAP1 is
  dephosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus. There, YAP1 binds to and activates
  TEAD transcription factors, promoting the expression of genes such as CTGF and CYR61.
  The Wnt, MAPK, PI3K, EMT, Notch, EGFR, TNF, cAMP and HGF/c-MET signaling pathways
  affect the expression of YAP1 in tumor cells. X indicates inhibition. YAP1, yes-associated
