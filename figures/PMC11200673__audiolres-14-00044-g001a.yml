caption: (a) This shows a transverse section through the cuticular plate of a type
  I vestibular hair cell. The cuticular plate is a bowl-shaped actin gel constructed
  of filaments with no directionality. The kinocilium is on the right. The dots represent
  stereociliary rootlets projecting down from stereocilia that have tip links to the
  kinocilium. The striated organelle (STO) is subcuticular. Points of extra adherence
  (where stereociliary rootlets preferentially tend to focus) are indicated by the
  black areas at the sides. (b) In this vertical section, the STO is in pink, separated
  from the cuticular plate by a dense cluster of exceptionally large mitochondria.
  The distal calyx of the afferent vestibular axon (shown in yellow) contacts the
  hair cell and reaches to just below the cuticular plate. Beneath the cuticular plate
  of the cell is the layer of mitochondria (for energy supply), some of which are
  contacted by stereociliary rootlets which have passed through the cuticular plate.
  The axons labelled “B” are vestibular efferents standardly placed on the outside
  of the calyx. The axons labelled “A” are the small number of efferent axons, which
  bypass the calyx and synapse directly on the apical type I hair cells. (c) This
  illustrates the “emergency” fall prevention strategy, activated by the small population
  of type “A” cells. The stereocilia have been displaced due to the slip. This deformed
  the STO. As a result, the attached kinocilium at site “1” has been displaced. This
  is maximal at right angles to the direction of the unexpected movement in the utricular
  striola. The detected direction of the rapid response will hopefully allow for a
  protective injury-preventing movement. This emergency response pathway provides
  further evidence about the extreme complexity of the vestibular system
