caption: RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis reveal the potential effects of Rux treatment
  on mouse hearts. (A) PCA identified the mice as two groups, namely the SCM group
  and the Rux group. N = 4 in each group. (B) DEGs between the SCM group and the Rux
  treatment group were shown in the volcano map. (C) KEGG analysis identified changes
  in the cardiac pathways of mice with SCM following Rux therapy. (D) The heat map
  indicated that senescence markers, specifically P53 and P21, were downregulated
  in mice hearts with SCM after Rux treatment. N = 4 in each group. (E) The relative
  levels of SASP-related genes were displayed in the heatmap between the SCM and the
  Rux groups, including CXCL1, CXCL5, MMP3, IL-1α, TGFβ2, CXCL14, IL-6, CXCL10, GDL15,
  and IL-1β. N = 4 in each group. (F) GSEA analysis demonstrated that the JAK-STAT
  pathway was up-regulated in SCM-induced mouse hearts and down-regulated after treatment
  with Rux. (G) GO analysis identified changes in the cardiac biological processes
  of SCM mice following Rux therapy. (H) The heatmap demonstrated that the relative
  levels of MRC complex-related genes were upregulated post Rux treatment in SCM-induced
  mice hearts. N = 4 in each group. (I) The heatmap demonstrated that the relative
  levels of oxidative stress-related genes were up-regulated post Rux treatment in
  SCM-induced mice hearts. N = 4 in each group. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *
