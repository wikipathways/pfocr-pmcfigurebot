caption: Effect of atractylenolide-Ⅰ (AT-Ⅰ), AT-II, AT-III, and IFN-γ on cell viability
  in CRC cells. HT29 and HCT15 cells were treated with AT-Ⅰ (A), AT-II (B), and AT-III
  (C) at 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 200, and 400 μmol/L, respectively. Cell counting
  kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to measure the cell viability of HT29 and HCT15 cells.
  (D) CCK-8 assays were used to measure the cell viability of HT29 and HCT15 cells
  treated with AT-II at 40, 80, 100, 200, and 400 μmol/L for 24 and 48h, respectively.
  (E) Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 after HT29 and HCT15 cells were treated
  with IFN-γ at a dose of 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 ng/ml for 24 and 48h, respectively.
  Results were presented as mean ± SD, ▲P<0.05, ▲▲P<0.01, vs. Control (Con) group.
