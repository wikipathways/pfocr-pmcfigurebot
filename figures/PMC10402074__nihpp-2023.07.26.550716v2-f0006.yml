figure_title: ATF3 regulates the antiviral immune response.
caption: 'ATF3 regulates the antiviral immune response. A549 cells WT and ATF3 KO
  cells were mock-infected or infected with ZIKVPR (moi=10 PFU/cell) and polyA-selected
  RNA expression was examined by RNA-seq analysis 24-hours post-infection. (A) PCA
  plot summarizing variance in gene expression in two A549 genotypes (WT and ATF3
  KO) and infection conditions (mock and ZIKV). (B-C) Enhanced volcano plots showing
  differentially expressed genes in ZIKV-infected cells compared to (B) the mock-infected
  A549 WT or (C) ATF KO cells. The dotted lines represent the adjusted p-value threshold
  of 0.05 and fold-change (FC) threshold of 2. (D) The venn diagram shows the number
  of significantly (p-value < 0.05) upregulated (fold-change > 2; 2FC) genes in ZIKV-infected
  cells that are shared or unique between the two A549 cell genotypes (WT or ATF KO).
  (E) Metascape pathway enrichment analysis (Reactome) of shared and unique gene groups
  described in panel. The dotplot represents top ten enriched Reactome terms for each
  gene set. (F) Heatmaps showing relative expression values (row-normalized z-score)
  of genes associated with interferon signaling pathway that were significantly upregulated
  in ZIKV infection condition in at least one A549 genotype (WT or ATF3 KO). Genotype-specific
  shared or unique genes and select immune gene categories are highlighted in different
  colors as indicated in the legend. (G-I) mRNA expression of select innate immune
  response genes, (G) IFNB1, (H) STAT1, and (I) IFIT1 were validated by RT-qPCR analyses
  following ZIKV infection (moi=1 and 10 PFU/cell). Target RNAs were normalized to
  ACTB mRNA, and the mRNA expression was determined by the 2−ΔΔCt method. These RT-qPCR
  validation experiments were undertaken in three technical replicates from three
  separate experiments that were also independent from the RNA-seq samples. The data
  represent mean ± SD. Statistical significance was determined by Student T-test.
  *p<0.01, **p<0.001, ***p<0.0005, ****p<0.0001. (J) IFN-β protein secretion 24 hours
  post-infection was measured by ELISA in WT and ATF3 KO cells. The data show the
  mean ± SD. N=3. *p<0.05. (K, L) Protein expression of (K) STAT1 and phospho-STAT1
  (p-STAT1), and (L) IFIT1 and MX1 were analyzed by western blotting. GAPDH levels
  were used as the loading control. # denotes the same western blot membrane that
  was probed for STAT1, IFIT1 and GAPDH. The images are separated into two panels,
  K) shows changes in STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1, and L) shows the levels of IFIT1
  and MX1 interferon induced proteins. Phosphorylated-STAT1 and GAPDH (and MX1 and
  GAPDH) proteins where blotted and probed on separate membranes. The blots shown
  are representatives from two separate experiments'
