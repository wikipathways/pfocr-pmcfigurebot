caption: New treatment strategies for metabolic disease and diabetes mellitus with
  non-coding RNAs. Non-coding RNAs play a central role in the oversight of complex
  metabolic pathways that offer innovative treatment avenues for metabolic disease
  and diabetes mellitus (DM). Innovative considerations involve non-coding RNA pathways
  with microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular ribonucleic acids (circRNAs), Wnt signaling,
  and Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) that are dependent upon programmed
  cell death pathways, such as apoptosis and the externalization of membrane phosphatidylserine
  (PS) residues on cell membranes, cellular metabolic pathways with AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) pathways with
  nicotinamide, and growth factor applications. These pathways intersect with one
  another for new therapeutic strategies, such as controlling microglial activation
  and limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Microglia can be detrimental
  to the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to generate oxidative stress but
  also can be beneficial for the clearance of toxins (amyloid) in the brain and the
  reduction of inflammation. Importantly, microglial pathways are overseen by Wnt
  signaling and erythropoietin (EPO). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells
  2 (TREM2) is vital to foster microglial survival to prevent inflammation. In addition,
  metformin, as well as trophic factors with EPO, as examples of new therapeutic strategies,
  can reduce metabolic dysfunction and assist with the treatment of dementia, cardiovascular
  disease, multiple sclerosis, and peripheral neuropathy through the oversight of
  microglia, AMPK (maintains mitochondrial function), and non-coding RNA pathways
