figure_title: Using human data on cardiovascular risk associated with T1DM to guide
  mechanistic studies in mouse models
caption: Human studies have shown that age and HbA1c (as a marker of suboptimal glycemic
  control) are the strongest risk factors for incident CVD in people with T1DM. Other
  risk factors that associate with CVD risk are (in alphabetical order) APOC3, blood
  pressure, low HDL-cholesterol and altered HDL composition, LDL-cholesterol, renal
  disease, smoking, triglycerides, and white blood cell count. Research in mouse models
  of T1DM-associated lesion initiation and progression has demonstrated that APOC3
  is in the causal pathway of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, likely working
  by slowing the clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoprotein particles (RLPs) derived
  from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). These effects of diabetes are due to
  insulin deficiency and/or reduced hepatic insulin action rather than to hyperglycemia.
  In mouse models in which diabetes is associated with myelopoiesis, hyperglycemia
  contributes to the increased levels of circulating myeloid cells (monocytes and
  neutrophils), leading to increased lesion progression and reduced lesion regression
  through a pathway that involves the receptor for advanced glycation end-products
  (RAGE) in bone marrow progenitor cells and release of the damage-associated molecular
  pattern proteins S100A8 and S100A9 from neutrophils. However, myelopoiesis is not
  required for diabetes to exacerbate atherosclerosis, and hyperglycemia is not sufficient
  to explain the increased CVD risk associated with diabetes. Diabetes also results
  in cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages through an APOC3-dependent pathway,
  and causes dampened macrophage metabolism - macrophage phenotypes likely to contribute
  to worsened lesion morphology, including necrotic core expansion. CVD risk factors
  in people with T1DM that play causal roles in mouse models of T1DM-associated atherosclerosis
  are highlighted by red font. WBC; white blood cell count. More research is needed
  to establish whether similar mechanisms apply to T2DM. Created with BioRender.com.
