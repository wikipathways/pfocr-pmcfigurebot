caption: 'a, Phosphorylation-associated PPI perturbing mutations altered the proteomic
  changes in COAD and UCEC. The abundance of proteins was quantified using the TMT
  technique. Significance was determined by two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test. b,
  Phosphorylation-associated PPI perturbing mutations in the EGFR-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK
  cascade signaling pathway. The whole transmembrane EGFR structures were constructed
  by three crystal structures (PDB: 3NJP, 2M20, 2GS6). The membrane model is shown
  in green. The phosphorylation sites are indicated by the “P” symbol. The detailed
  interface structure of SOS1-KRAS is also shown in the inset. The key mutated residue
  Gln61 on KRAS forms a hydrogen bond (purple dashed line) with residue Thr935 on
  SOS1, and Tyr884 on SOS1 is involved in a cation-π interaction (red dash line) with
  residue Arg73 on KRAS. Two subunits of RAF protein structure models were built by
  RAF1 and BRAF, separately (PDB: 6VJJ and 6Q0J). The two subunits are connected by
  a disordered loop indicated by blue cartoon lines. Two heterodimers of KRAS-RAF1
  and BRAF-MEK1 constitutes the KRAS-RAF-MEK1 complex. PDB ID of each complex structure
  model is provided. c, Highlighted examples of responses to the MEK inhibitor drugs
  trametinib for KRAS-SOS1 mutations (n = 103 mutated cell lines, n = 827 WT cell
  lines), refametinib for KRAS-BRAF mutations (n = 179 mutated cell lines, n = 1,610
  WT cell lines), and binimetinib for KRAS-SOS1 mutations in the PDX models (n = 62
  mutated samples, n = 166 WT samples). Significance was determined by ANOVA'
