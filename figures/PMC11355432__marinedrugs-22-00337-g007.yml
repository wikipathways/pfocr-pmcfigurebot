figure_title: The proposed model for the protective mechanism of CPE against CKD-induced
  HAS.
caption: 'The proposed model for the protective mechanism of CPE against CKD-induced
  HAS. Left: 5/6 NFx induces RAAS overactivation, leading to an increase in Ang II.
  This results in the upregulation of AT1R and the downregulation of AT2R and Mas1.
  These alterations establish a vasopressive state, reducing the GFR and allowing
  for the accumulation of uremic compounds. The sustained production of ROS, LP, and
  PC surpasses endogenous antioxidant systems, causing oxidative stress-mediated cellular
  damage and inflammation in the endothelium and smooth vascular muscle of the arteriole.
  This inflammatory environment triggers the expression of iNOS and the further oxidation
  of NO· to ONOO−, contributing to nitrative stress. Simultaneously, cellular damage
  leads to depletion in the glomeruli filtering barrier by diminishing nephrin and
  podocin, allowing for the occurrence of proteinuria. The persistent overactivation
  of RAAS increases the peripheral swiftness of arteries, culminating in endothelial
  dysfunction and the establishment of SAH. This perpetuates the decline in the GFR
  and the progression of CKD. Upon oral-gavage administration, CPE undergoes digestion,
  releasing chromo-peptides and PEB. These components mitigate ROS-mediated cellular
  damage through scavenging. Additionally, CPE prevents dysregulation in vasomodulation
  by normalizing the expression of AT1R, AT2R, and the Mas1/Akt1/eNOS pathway. Through
  these mechanisms, CPE maintains kidney function and prevents the establishment of
  SAH. CKD: Chronic kidney disease; BUN: Blood ureic nitrogen; GFR: Glomerular filtration
