figure_title: The biological characteristics of GBM subcluster 6.
caption: 'The biological characteristics of GBM subcluster 6. (A) Heatmap shows the
  mean of top50 marker genes of clusters. The line graph represents the differential
  expression of the mean of these marker genes in all clusters, and on the right side
  are displayed the ligands associated with M2 macrophage polarization or chemotaxis
  in subcluster C6. The bar chart represents the functional enrichment of GO (BP,
  Biological Process; CC, Cellular Component; MF, Molecular Function), KEGG and Hallmark
  pathways for marker genes in glioma subcluster 6. The x-axis and y-axis represent
  -log10 (p value) and pathways. (B) Expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein
  (MCPs: MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-4) in different glioma clusters. Data are shown as means
  ± s.e.m. (C) Developmental inference analysis shows the dynamic shift in cell state,
  with the arrow indicating the direction of cell state transition. (D) Feature plot
  displays represented marker genes for subcluster 9 (PDGFRA, OLIG1), subcluster 1
  (SEC61G, TNFRSF12A) and subcluster 6 (SPP1, FCER1G) across all glioma cells. (E)
  The trajectory analysis of all glioma cells is depicted in the first line, with
  color-coded representation based on glioma clusters, status and pseudotime. The
  second row displays a trajectory of root, subcluster 1, and subcluster 6. (F) Heatmap
  represents the expression patterns of genes during the developmental process from
  root to subcluster 1 and subcluster 6. The partial signature genes for each pattern
  are displayed on the right. (G) shows functional enrichment analysis of GO BP (red),
  GO CC (blue), and GO MF (green) for the gene module of cluster 6'
