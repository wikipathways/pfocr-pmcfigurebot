caption: (A) Seurat clustering (resolution 0.5) of CD4 TTS cells. The bar graph depicts
  the proportion of each cluster.(B) Top 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  of each cluster.(C)Monocle trajectory analysis overlaid on UMAP colored by Seurat
  clusters. </p/> (D) Single-cell heatmap depicts gene set variation analysis pathway
  analysis within each Seurat cluster.(E) Radar plot shows normalized enrichment scores
  of GSEA comparing CD4 SMARTA TTS cells from c4 (see Figure S4E) with defined Th
  cell lineage signatures. Numbers in parentheses are the FDR. A value of 0.00 = FDR
  < 10âˆ’3.(F) IPA pathway enrichment scoring of CD4 SMARTA TTS cells in c4 (see Figure
  S4E). All included pathways are significant with p < 0.05. Pathways colored in red
  were specifically mentioned in the text.(G) Venn diagrams show the overlap and difference
  in DEGs of paralyzed tumor CD4 TTS cells, effector and exhausted virus-specific
  CD4 (left) and CD8 T cells (right). Each group was individually compared with naive
  T cells first prior to the comparisons shown. The numbers indicate the number of
  genes
