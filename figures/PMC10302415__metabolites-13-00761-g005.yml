caption: 'Bubble diagram of KEGG pathway analysis of differential metabolites. Note:
  (a) amniotic fluid supernatant group; (b) amniotic fluid cell sediment group; the
  metabolic pathway in which different metabolites are mainly involved is indicated
  by color and size. The change in ball color from red to black indicates that the
  difference is gradually reduced'
