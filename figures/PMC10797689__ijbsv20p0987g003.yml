  fibroblasts.
caption: Decrease of glutamine catabolism can reduce the activation of kidney fibroblasts.
  (A) Glutamine deprivation BPTES, EGCG and AOA can inhibit the glutamine metabolic
  pathway. The proliferation of fibroblast was assessed by the CCK-8 experiment. (B)
  and (C) The migration of fibroblast was detected by the Transwell migration assay.
  Scale bars are 50 µm. (D) and (E) Immunofluorescence staining displayed the expression
  of FN and COL1. Scale bars are 50 µm. (F) and (G) Real-time PCR showed the mRNA
  level of fibrotic markers (FN, COL1, and ɑ-SMA). (H) - (J) Western blot showed the
  protein level of FN and α-SMA. *p < 0.05
