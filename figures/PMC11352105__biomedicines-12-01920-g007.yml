figure_title: MLC901 activated the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway.
caption: 'MLC901 activated the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway. (a) Western Blot
  Analysis: To assess the relative expression levels of p-AKT, AKT, p-GSK-3β, and
  GAP-43 proteins in spinal cord tissues from sham (H), treated (T), and untreated
  (UT) rats with β-Tubulin as a loading control. (b) Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI):
  To measure the expression levels of p-AKT/AKT, p-GSK-3β, and GAP-43 (neurogenesis
  marker) in spinal cord tissues of sham (H), treated (T), and untreated (UT) rats.
  (i) p-AKT/AKT Ratio: T rats showed higher expression compared to UT rats, indicating
  enhanced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. (ii) p-GSK-3β expression: UT rats showed
  higher expression compared to T rats, suggesting that MLC901 treatment inhibits
  GSK-3β activity and reduces apoptosis. (iii) GAP-43 Expression: Significantly higher
  expression in T rats compared to UT rats (p < 0.05), indicating that MLC901 promotes
  neurogenesis. Statistical Analysis: Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation
  (SD) (n = 6/group). Statistical significance was determined using a one-way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA), followed by a post hoc test. * p < 0.05 indicates significant
  differences between T rats and the UT SCI group'
