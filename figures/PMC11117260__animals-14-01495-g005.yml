figure_title: Effect of high-concentrate diet feeding on histamine receptor and inflammatory
  response in liver.
caption: Effect of high-concentrate diet feeding on histamine receptor and inflammatory
  response in liver. (A) mRNA expression of haistamine receptor H1R and H2R in liver.
  (B) mRNA expression of NF-κB signaling pathway-related genes in liver, (C) the concentration
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of hepatic vein measured by Radioimmunoassay
  kits. (D) the protein expression of NF-κB p65 and phosphorylated p65 by Western
  Blot. * indicates p < 0.05 and ** indicates p < 0.01. HC, high-concentrate group.
  LC, low-concentrate group
