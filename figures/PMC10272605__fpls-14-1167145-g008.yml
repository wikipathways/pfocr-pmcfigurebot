caption: Adaptive changes in amino acid metabolism in GS and NGS during salinity stress.
  Amino acid metabolic pathways and the general pattern of metabolites changes associated
  with the pathways in GS and NGS at 6 h to 96 h after salinity stress (A). Expression
  changes of the genes involved in metabolic pathways in GS and NGS at different salt
  stress time points. The pathway ID column indicates the gene product in relation
  to metabolic pathway (B).
article_title: Transcriptome analysis showed that tomato-rootstock enhanced salt tolerance
  of grafted seedlings was accompanied by multiple metabolic processes and gene differences.
