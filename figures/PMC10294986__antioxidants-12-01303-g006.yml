  diet.
caption: 'The inflammasome signaling pathway was downregulated by an OLA-supplemented
  diet. (A) NLRP3/ASC, (B) Caspase 11, (C) IL-18, and (D) Caspase 1. Protein expressions
  were analyzed by immunoblots in kidney lysates. Densitometry was performed following
  normalization to the control (β-actin housekeeping gene). Data are represented as
  the means ± SEM (n = 6). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), using Tukey–Kramer
  multiple comparisons test as post hoc test: # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001
  vs. naïve group; * p < 0.05 ** p < 0.01; significant difference versus SD-pristane
  group'
