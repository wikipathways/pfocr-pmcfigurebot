figure_title: Canonical signaling pathways of cGAS
caption: 'Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) detects cytosolic DNA originating
  from external sources, such as viral and bacterial infections, as well as internal
  sources, including damaged DNA from the nucleus and mitochondria. When DNA is released
  into the cytoplasm, cGAS synthesizes cGAMP in response. cGAMP then interacts with
  stimulator of interferon genes (STING), leading to its dimerization and oligomerization
  at the endoplasmic reticulum. This activation of STING initiates two distinct signaling
  pathways: the proinflammatory signaling pathway via NF-κB and the immune response
  signaling pathway via the interferon regulatory factor 3/interferon α (IRF3/IFNα)
  pathway. These pathways collectively regulate a variety of cellular processes, including
  cell proliferation, inflammation, immune responses, and cell death'
