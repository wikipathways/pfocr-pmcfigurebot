figure_title: Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of P.
caption: 'Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of P.montana var. thomsonii
  at different growth stages: the left side of the figure represents the GX1 vs. GD1
  group, while the right side represents the GX2 vs. GD2 group. (a) Principal component
  analysis (PCA) of the two comparison groups. (b) Differential gene volcano maps
  for the two comparison groups. (c) KEGG analysis of all DEGs for the two comparison
  groups. Each bubble in the plot represents a pathway, the abscissa and bubble size
  of which jointly indicate the magnitude of the impact factors of the pathway. A
  larger bubble size indicates a larger impact factor. The abscissa of bubbles indicates
  the enrichment ratio of genes in each pathway. The bubble colors represent the Q-value
  of the enrichment analysis, with lighter colors showing a higher confidence level.
  Sorted by the Q-value, the top 20 metabolic pathways are plotted in the bubble chart'
