figure_title: Downregulated genes associated with reduced Δχ and enriched for neurochemical
  and neurodevelopmental pathways in the motor striatum
caption: (A) Transcriptomic and Δχ t-statistical data were extracted from colocalized
  coordinates defined within striatal subdivisions. (B) Matrices representing gene
  expression (48×20,737 predictor variables), and case-control Δχ variation (1×20,737
  response variables) were used for cross decomposition via PLS regression. (C) Regional
  scores of the first PLS component (PLS1) exhibited a significant positive correlation
  with Δχ variations. (D) A weighted gene list based on the bootstrapped distribution
  of PLS1 Z-scores was used to define lists of downregulated (PLS−) and upregulated
  (PLS+) genes outside the range of the 5% and 95% quantiles of the normal distribution.
  (E) Protein connectivity networks for PLS− genes exhibited significant PPI enrichment
  (PFDR<10−16), indicating that they are partially biologically connected. Strongly
  connected and highly enriched terms included “chemical synaptic transmission” (GO-BP:0007268),
  “nervous sysfem development” (GO-BP:0007399), “signaling receptor activity” (GO-MF:0038023),
  and “neuroactive ligand-recepfor interaction” (KEGG:hsa04080). (F) The GO-BP term
  with the highest PPI network strength (“GABA signaling pathway”, GO-BP:0007214)
  included a sub-network of “GABA-A receptor activity” (CL:8612), a result that was
  replicated when including all 20,737 PLS-weighted genes. (G) A supplementary functional
  enrichment analysis revealed “GABA-A receptor complex” (GO-CC:1902711) as the cellular
  component term with the highest enrichment score. (H) The relationship between inhibitory
  neurotransmission and iron status in GTS is further visible in the heatmap illustrating
  the underlying structure of GABA receptor expression and case-control Δχ variations
