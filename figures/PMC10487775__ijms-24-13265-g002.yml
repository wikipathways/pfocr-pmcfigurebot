figure_title: NLRC5 regulates microglial activation via the NF-κB signaling pathway
  in BV2 cells.
caption: 'NLRC5 regulates microglial activation via the NF-κB signaling pathway in
  BV2 cells. (A) NF-κB dependent luciferase activity was measured in BV2-shCtrl and
  BV2-shNlrc5 cells treated with different concentrations of LPS. (B) Representative
  Western blot image of nuclear/cytoplasmic P65 in BV2-shCtrl and BV2-shNlrc5 cells
  treated with LPS for 1 h and 4 h, respectively. (C) The relative expression of nuclear
  p65 was normalized to that of nuclear H3 and shown as a ratio to that in untreated
  BV2-shCtrl cells (n = 5 for each group). (D) Representative Western blot image of
  cleaved-caspase 1 in BV2-shCtrl and BV2-shNlrc5 cells treated with LPS plus ATP.
  (E) The relative expression of cleaved-caspase 1 in LPS-treated groups was normalized
  to that of β-actin and shown as a ratio to that in untreated BV2-shCtrl cells (n
  = 5 for each group). All data were presented as mean ± SEM ((A), LPS: F (2, 12)
  = 239.0, p < 0.001; NLRC5: F (1, 12) = 194.0, p < 0.001; Interaction: F (2, 12)
  = 49.16, p < 0.001; (C), LPS: F (5, 48) = 23.54, p < 0.001; NLRC5: F (1, 48) = 49.92,
  p < 0.001; Interaction: F (5, 48) = 8.539, p < 0.001; (E), LPS: F (2, 24) = 11.81,
  p < 0.001; NLRC5: F (1, 24) = 0.4426, p = 0.5122; Interaction: F (2, 24) = 0.1129,
  p = 0.8937). A two-way ANOVA was used to determine the statistical significance
  between the two groups. * p ≤ 0.05 and *** p ≤ 0.001. ns: no significant difference'
