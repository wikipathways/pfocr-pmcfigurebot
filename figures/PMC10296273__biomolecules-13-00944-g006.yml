caption: 'Schematic outlining the relationships between cellular metabolic pathways
  and the mitochondria. Although separate, each metabolic pathway within the cell
  feeds back into the mitochondria by producing metabolites required for ATP production.
  Deficiency/damage/inhibition to any of metabolic pathway can result in metabolic
  deficiency, potentially triggering an RTG response. Legend: G6P—glucose-6-phosphate;
  F6P—fructose-6-phosphate; 3PG—glycerate-3-phosphate; PEP—phosphoenolpyruvate; ACoA—acetyl
  coenzyme A; α-KG—α-ketoglutarate; PPP—pentose phosphate pathway; P5C—1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate;
  TCA—tricarboxylic acid; ROS—reactive oxygen species and conditions [240]. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction can therefore be a major contributing factor to a varied range of pathologies
  with potentially serious debilitating and/or life-threatening consequences'
