caption: Global metabolomic profiling uncovers dysregulated metabolic pathways and
  lipid classes with age in kidney tissues. (A) Metabolomics heatmap showing the relative
  abundance of the top 25 metabolite hits with age. (B) Metabolic pathway analysis
  revealing cluster of metabolites related to signaling networks that are disrupted
  in the aging kidney. (D-M) Metabolite pools illustrating the metabolic pathways
  that are altered with age in the kidney–Redox/NAD+ Metabolism and Amino Acid Metabolism/Biosynthesis.
  For each tissue and metabolite in the heatmaps, the aged samples were normalized
  to the median of the young samples and then log2 transformed. Young, n= 6; aged,
  n= 6. For all panels, error bars indicate SEM, ** indicates P≤ 0.01; and *P≤ 0.05,
  calculated with Student’s t-test.
