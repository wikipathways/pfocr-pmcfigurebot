  H1299 cells.
caption: Knocking down SLCO4A1 inhibits the proliferative ability of A549 and H1299
  cells. (A and B) Knockdown efficiency of SLCO4A1 in (A) A549 cells and (B) H1299
  cells (upper panel, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR results; lower panel,
  western blot results). (C) The correlation between SLCO4A1 and cell cycle pathway.
  (D and E) Cell Counting Kit-8 proliferation assay demonstrating that knockdown of
  SLCO4A1 inhibits proliferation ability of (D) A549 cells and (E) H1299 cells. (F)
  Plate colony formation assay showing that knockdown SLCO4A1 inhibits proliferation
  ability of A549 and H1299 cells. (G) Knockdown of SLCO4A1 affects the expression
  of ki-67 and PCNA in A549 and H1299 cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. SLCO4A1,
  solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1; si-, small interfering;
  NC, negative control
