caption: RNA-Seq and IPA for identification of potential downstream molecular mechanisms
  associated with synergistic interaction of EphA2 and HDAC inhibition. (A) RNA-Seq
  strategy and comparative analysis of pathways downregulated with combination therapy
  in Ishikawa cells. (B,C) Validation of RNA-Seq analysis of AKT pathway repression
  in Ishikawa (B) and Hec1A (C) cells; additionally phosphorylated S6 levels as an
  indicator of mTOR downregulation in Ishikawa and Hec1A cells are shown. (D,E) Validation
  of Axl as the upstream regulator of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in Ishikawa
  (D) and Hec1A (E) cells at 48 h in untreated and treated conditions
