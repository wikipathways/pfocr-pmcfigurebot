caption: Downstream functional analysis of CD4+ TEM cluster core markers in COVID-19.
  (A,B) The spatial distribution of marker expression in each cell subset is designated
  and visualized using UMAP. (C) An illustration of the most prominent switching gene
  order derived from two markers and different sets of known proteins. (D,E) Expression
  of LAG3 (D) and SLFN5 (E) from (C). (F–I) The number of pairings of receptors and
  ligands between marker-positive and -negative CD4+ TEM cells and other T cell subsets
  is shown by the cell-cell communication network. LAG3 (F,H), SLFN5 (G,I). The thickness
  of each line represents the number of pairs. (J) Enrichment of metabolic pathways
  by a bubble diagram founded on differential metabolites between marker-positive
  and -negative CD4+ TEM cells. Each bubble denotes a single metabolic pathway. The
  number of involved metabolites and the p-value are listed on the right. (K,L) GO
  and KEGG analysis of GBP2-positive and -negative CD4+ TEM cells. (M,N) Volcano plots
  of differences in expression of PTB (M) and COVID-19 (N) CD4+ TEM cell markers detected
  using bulk RNA-seq analysis. (O,P) The mRNA expression level of CD4+ TEM cell markers
  (GBP2, TRAV1-2, and ODF2L) in the THP-1 macrophages (O) and A549 (P) infected with
  M. tuberculosis. Data are represented as averages ± SD. * p <0.05, ** p <0.01, ***
  p <0.001
