caption: Multi-omics for the study of the human gut microbiome in inflammatory bowel
  disease. Metagenomics involves identifying the bacterial composition and diversity
  using techniques such as 16S rRNA gene amplicon or shotgun sequencing. This method
  provides information on the presence or absence of specific genes in the microbiome.
  Metatranscriptomics focuses on assessing the functionality of the microbiome by
  analysing gene expression over time using RNA sequencing techniques. Proteomics
  studies the entire set of proteins that a genome can express in a cell, known as
  the proteome. Combining metagenomic and metaproteomic data, it is possible to characterise
  signalling proteins and pathways. Metabolomics explores the metabolome, which consists
  of metabolites derived from both the host and microorganisms
