figure_title: Effect of NAR on NF-κB signaling pathway in the lung tissue.
caption: 'Effect of NAR on NF-κB signaling pathway in the lung tissue. (A) Western
  blotting analysis of the NF-κB signaling pathway. (B) Relative quantitative protein
  expression levels indicated that NAR intervention reduced the protein expression
  of p-IκBα/IκBα, p-IKKα-β/IKKα, p-IKKα-β/IKKβ, and p-P65/P65 in lung tissue. (C)
  In the immunohistochemical examination of NF-κB P65 in lung tissue, the red arrows
  show p-P65 immunoreactive cells. (D,E) Integrated optical density (IOD) of p-P65-immunoreactive
  cells and positive cell count. Scale bar: 40 μm.(The red arrows point to the p-P65
  immunoreactive cells)'
