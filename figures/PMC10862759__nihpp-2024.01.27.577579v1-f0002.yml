caption: 'A) Boxplot of clinical variables significantly different (q < 0.1) between
  VRS. B) Heatmap of difference between means of clinical variables (in A) in each
  VR_C (column) relative to VSC. The difference is reported for significant comparisons
  (adjusted P-values (p.adj) < 0.1) C) Heatmap of mutations and clinical factors showing
  significant association with VRS (q < 0.1, see Methods). D) Abundance scores of
  AML blast-types with significantly different (q < 0.1) abundances across VRS. Heatmap
  of differentially expressed pathways comparing VR_Cs to VSC (E) and each other (F).
  Red indicates over-expression and blue suppression. Text in each cell is the q-value,
  with significance at q < 0.1. Note: comparison of differences between multiple groups
  was performed using ANOVA and p-values corrected by FDR. Post-hoc pairwise testing
  was performed using Tukeyâ€™s test'
