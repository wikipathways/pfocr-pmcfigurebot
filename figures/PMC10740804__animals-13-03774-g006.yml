caption: Effect of feeding with varying levels of probiotic-fermented distillers grain
  on the rumen metabolic pathway in finishing cattle. (A,B) Pathway analysis of significant
  differences in rumen metabolites of PFDG-15% vs. Control and PFDG-30% vs. Control,
  respectively. Control, PFDG-15%, and PFDG-30% represent the group without PFDG supplementation,
  the group with 15% PFDG substituting for 15% concentrate, and the group with 30%
  PFDG substituting for 30% concentrate, respectively. The samples for each experimental
  group consisted of rumen fluid samples from six cattle (n = 6)
