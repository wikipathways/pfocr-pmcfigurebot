figure_title: EZH2-mediated epigenetic suppression of the MHC-I pathway in CRACD-inactivated
  SCLC subtype
caption: 'A, GSEA of DEGs (from CRPR2 vs. RPR2 scRNA-seq datasets).B-D, Impact of
  Cracd KO on histone modification of mouse SCLC tumors. Immunostaining of SCLC tumors
  (RPR2 vs. CRPR2) for H3K27ac, H3K27me2, and K3K27me3 (B). Nuclei were counterstained
  with DAPI. Histone modifications were quantified by analyzing fluorescence intensity
  per 660 μm2 using ZEN software (Zeiss) (C). Scale bars = 40 μm. Immunoblotting shows
  the impact of CRACD KO on H3K27ac, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 in whole-cell lysates
  of RPR2 and CRPR2 tumors (D). The representative images are shown. P values were
  calculated using the Student’s t-test; error bars: SD.E, F, De-repression of the
  MHC-I pathway–associated genes by EZH2 inhibition. RT-qPCR analysis of genes related
  to the mouse MHC-I pathway after 72 hr of treatment of the CRPR2 cell line (derived
  from mouse SCLC tumors) with 20 μmol/L GSK343, an EZH2 inhibitor (E). RT-qPCR analysis
  of genes related to the human MHC-I pathway after 72 hr of treatment of a human
  SCLC cell line (NCI-H2081) with GSK343 (20 μmol/L) (F). Data are expressed as mean
  ± SD (n = 3 independent assays). Of note, GSK inhibition upregulated the expression
  of the MHC-I-encoding genes (H2-Q1/2/4 and H2-T3 [mouse]; HLA-A/B/C [human]).G,
  Assessment of in vitro response of RPR2 and CRPR2 cells to GSK343; 72 hr after GSK343
  treatment, cell viability was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), error

  Mice subcutaneously injected with CRPR2 cells were treated with vehicle or GSK343
  (20 mg/kg, every other day from 5 days after transplantation; intraperitoneal injection).
  Average tumor volumes at the indicated time points are plotted. error bars: SD.I,
  Immunostaining of CRPR2 allograft tumors with anti-CD8 antibody (left), Nuclei were
  counterstained with DAPI. Quantification of CD8+ T cell counts per 210 μm2 in CRPR2
  tumor tissue (right). Representative images are shown. P values were calculated
  using the Student’s t-test; error bars: SD.J, Tumor-infiltrated T cells were stained
  with CD3, a marker for T cells (left), and T cells were counted per 210 μm2 in CRPR2
  tumor tissues (right). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Representative images
  are shown. P values were calculated using the Student’s t-test; error bars: SD.K,
  Dot plot showing the expression of the MHC-I pathway genes, EZH2 target genes, and
  PRC2 target genes, in human SCLC tumor samples (SC1- and SC2-type).L, Violin plot
  visualizing the expression of the MHC-I pathway–related genes (HLA-A, B, C, E, and
  TAP1/2) between SC1- and SC2-type patient datasets.M, GSEA of gene sets associated
  with EZH2 targets, PRC2 targets, the MHC-I pathway, and antigen-processing and presentation
  in SC1- compared to SC2-type tumors.N, Correlation scatter plot analysis showing
  the relationship between CRACD and MHC-I genes (HLA-A, B, C, E, and TAP1/2). Pearson’s
  correlation analysis (using GraphPad Prism) showed a positive transcriptional correlation
  between CRACD and MHC-I genes (HLA-A, B, C, E, and TAP1/2) in SCLC patient tumor
  cells that express both CRACD and MHC-I genes (HLA-A, B, C, E, and TAP1/2). r, Pearson
  correlation coefficient. P values were calculated using the Student’s t-test.O,
  Representative marker gene expression of SC1- and SC2-type tumors were visualized
  for each patient. Genes that were specifically expressed in each group were selected
  from the differentially expressed gene analysis using the Wilcoxon method'
