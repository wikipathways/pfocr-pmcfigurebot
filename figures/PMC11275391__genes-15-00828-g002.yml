  kingianum Coll.et Hemsl. (A) KEGG differential metabolite classification diagram.
  The ordinate is the name of the KEGG metabolic pathway, and the abscissa is the
  number of metabolites indicated by this pathway and its percentage associated with
  the total number of metabolites annotated. (B) Scatter diagram of the enrichment
  of differential metabolites in KEGG pathways
