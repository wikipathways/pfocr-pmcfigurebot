figure_title: Comparison of effectiveness of different ODE surrogate models for solving
  the metabolic pathway ABM control problem
caption: The red square shows the optimal inflow point and the corresponding mean
  loss function value as determined for the ABM by a grid search between 0 and 1.0
  with a step size of 0.1, where in each step 100 simulations runs were averaged.
  The red line highlights the mean of each of the 100 simulation runs of the ABM and
  the orange line the 75% confidence band. Circles denote the predicted optimal inflow
  and corresponding loss function value for each ODE surrogate. ODE models that did
  not exhibit a minimum within the 0 to 1.0 domain have their domain of integrability
  shown with a line. The line depicts the range of loss function values predicted
  by the approximation. The S-system I performed worst, as it could only be integrated
  between 0.8 and 1.0, and in that range predicted loss function values between 8
  and 9. While S-system C, Quad I, and Linear I, all resulted in models with a larger
  domain over which they could be integrated, neither had a minimum within their respective
  domains. GMA I was the ODE surrogate that best predicted an optimal inflow of substrate
  closest to the ABM and Mech. I best predicted the loss function value of the ABM
  at the optimal inflow point
