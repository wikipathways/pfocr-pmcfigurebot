caption: 'Strategies for constructing community metabolic models for a binary consortium:
  (A) mixed modeling approach, (B) partitioned network modeling, (C) dynamic multispecies
  modeling. The metabolic pathway common to both consortia is indicated in red. These
  schemes are presented according to [178] with some modifications'
