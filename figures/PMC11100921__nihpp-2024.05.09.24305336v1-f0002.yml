figure_title: Differentially expressed T-cell fitness signatures in PBMCs from responders
  and non-responders to MUC1 vaccination is associated with CD4 frequencies and expression
  of multiple regulators of T-cell help
caption: (A,B) iCOSL signaling pathway-related genes are associated with response
  to MUC1 vaccination at Baseline (A) and Week 2 post-vaccination (B) in MUC1 vaccine
  responders and non-responders. Heatmaps are organized as in Figure 1. (C) Violin
  plots of CD4+ T-cell frequencies as determined by flow cytometry. (D-F) Violin plots
  of CD40L expression on CD4 T-cells (D), CD8 T-cells (E), and the change in ICOS
  levels on CD8 T-cells (Delta Week 2 vs. Week 0/Baseline) (F) measured by geometric
  mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
