caption: Mechanisms by which various microbial metabolites cause tumor progression
  and chronic inflammation. The TME is a complex system composed of immune cells,
  tumor cells, cytokines and blood vessels. Various metabolites enter the TME, affecting
  the activities of various internal cells and regulating the release of cytokines,
  thereby reshaping the TME to promote tumor progression. LPS activates the NF-ÎºB
  signaling pathway in prostate cancer, promoting the release of IL-6. The binding
  of LPS and TLR4 on colorectal cancer cells promotes VEGF secretion. LPS activation
  of TLR4 induces macrophages to upregulate CCL5 expression. LPS can cause chronic
  inflammation, leading to the accumulation of MDSCs and Tregs. SCFAs promote the
  differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells and the release of IL-17. SCFAs
  stimulate prostate cancer cells to secrete IGF-1. The accumulation of SCFAs promotes
  high expression of FPR on the surface of breast cancer cells. The accumulation of
  LCA upregulates CCL 28 and IL-8 by activating the GPR and Erk1/2 MAPK signaling
  pathways. 3-oxo LCA and isoallo LCA respectively inhibit the differentiation of
  Th17 cells and promote the differentiation of Treg cells. DCA binds to VEGFR2 to
  promote EMT and VM, while also promoting the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into
  Tregs. The figure was created using BioRender.com. TME, tumor microenvironment;
