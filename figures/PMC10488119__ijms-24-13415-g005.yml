caption: DEGs analysis after CPT1A knockdown. (a) The top 30 enriched pathways of
  DEGs. Pathways in red boxes indicate pathways that were subsequently studied. (b)
  Visual network diagram for correlation analysis of differentially expressed gene
  expression uses the software of Cytoscape 3.9.1 for graphing, gradient colors indicate
  the strength of the DEGs correlation (1â€“19)
