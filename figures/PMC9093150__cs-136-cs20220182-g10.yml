figure_title: Working hypothesis of the role of the prostanoid pathway in angiogenesis
  inhibitor-induced hypertension and renal injury
caption: Treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors (VEGF antibodies (Abs), VEGFR Ab,
  VEGF trap, or TKIs), as well as elevated levels of sFlt-1 (a soluble VEGFR) in preeclampsia
  all lead to disturbed VEGF signaling, thereby increasing ET-1. This causes hypertension
  and renal injury via endothelin type A (ETA) receptor stimulation. Such stimulation
  is accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and COX type 1 and type
  2 (COX-1/COX-2)-mediated PGI2 production. Normally, binding of PGI2 to its prostacyclin
  (IP) receptor results in beneficial vascular and renal effects, and thus initially
  this may be protective. Yet, in case of excessive PGI2 production, PGI2 can additionally
  stimulate other prostanoid receptors such as the thromboxane (TP) receptor, the
  main signaling receptor for TXA2, acting as an endothelium-derived contracting factor
  (EDCF). This could contribute to angiogenesis inhibitor-induced hypertension and
  nephrotoxicity. The present study has found that low-dose aspirin (resulting in
  selective COX-1 inhibition and TXA2 suppression) ameliorates TKI-induced hypertension,
  while high-dose aspirin (additionally resulting in COX-2 inhibition and PGI2 suppression)
  prevents renal injury.
