caption: Phosphoinositide signaling pathway. (A) Schematic representation of the phosphoinositide
  (PI) family. The enzymes participating in the conversion of one form of PI to another
  are shown. (B) Schematic representation of regulation of phosphoinositides on chemoattractant
  stimulation is depicted. Phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases control the specific
  phosphoinositide levels in the presence of a chemoattractant, which regulates the
  recruitment of phosphoinositide effectors to carry out targeted biological functions
