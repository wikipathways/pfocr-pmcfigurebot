caption: LIMK/Cofilin signaling pathways are critical for CM maturation and vessel
  formation during H-COs generation. (A) Western blotting images of LIMK/Cofilin signaling
  pathway (LIMK, pLIMK, Cofilin, and pCofilin) in H-COs treated with DMSO and LIMKi3.
  (B) Representative qRT-PCR analysis and (C) Western blotting images of cardiomyocyte
  maturation marker proteins (cTnT, MLC2v, MLC2a, TBX18, and JPH2) in H-COs treated
  with DMSO and LIMKi3. n = 3. ** p < 0.01. *** p < 0.001. **** p < 0.0001. (D) Representative
  qRT-PCR analysis of vessel formation markers (CD31, PDGFRβ, αSMA, and vWF) in H-COs
  treated with DMSO and LIMKi3. n = 3. * p < 0.05. ** p < 0.01. (E) qRT-PCR of ECM
  signaling pathway genes (COL4A2, LAMA2, LAMC1, and LAMC3) and (F) integrin genes
  (ITGB1, ITGB3 and ITGA7) in H-COs treated with DMSO and LIMKi3. n = 3. * p < 0.05.
  ** p < 0.01. *** p < 0.001. Western blot analysis of (G) ECM genes (COL1A, Laminin,
  and FN1), (H) TGFβ signaling genes (LEFTY, NODAL, PITX2, SMAD2, pSMAD2, SMAD3, and
  pSMAD3) and (I) angiogenesis genes (VEGFR2, pVEGFR2, PDGFRα, pPDGFRα, PDGFRβ, pPDGFβ,
  eNOS, peNOS, and HIF2A) in H-COs treated with DMSO and LIMKi3. (J) Schematic showing
  activation of LIMK/Cofilin signaling pathway via ECM-integrin interaction is critical
  for generation of mature and vascularized cardiac organoids derived from cell aggregates
  with high stemness
