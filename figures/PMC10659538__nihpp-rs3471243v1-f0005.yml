figure_title: Knockdown of SMAD1 and SMAD5 perturbs decidualization in endometrial
  stromal cells
caption: A) Volcano plot showing the expression of differentially expressed genes
  in siCTL + EPC vs. siSMAD1/5 + EPC treated endometrial stromal cells (using a cutoff
  of Log 2 FC >0.30, < −0.30, FDR < 0.05). Blue indicates genes that are down-regulated
  in siSMAD1/5 + EPC vs. siCTL + EPC, red indicates genes that are increased. (n=1
  individual without endometriosis). B) Dot plot showing the enrichment of genes in
  key signaling pathways after SMAD1/5 knockdown. C) Heatmap showing the expression
  and functional classification of key genes following SMAD1/5 knockdown + EPC versus
  siCTL + EPC treatment (n=3 individuals without endometriosis). D) Binding and expression
  target analysis (BETA) was used to integrate SMAD4 binding peaks with the transcriptional
  changes after SMAD1/5 knockdown in EPC-treated endometrial stromal cells. Dotplot
  displays the gene ontology classification of genes that were activated by SMAD1/5
  (i.e., were downregulated by SMAD1/5 and have a SMAD4 binding site). E) Motif analysis
  was performed on the group genes identified to be SMAD1/5/4 direct targets and displayed
  as “uptargets” (genes that were increased after SMAD1/5 knockdown and had a SMAD4
  peak) or as “downtargets” (genes that were downregulated after SMAD1/5 knockdown
  and had a SMAD4 peak)
