figure_title: CircRILPL1 promotes NPC cells migration, invasion, proliferation and
  alters the mechanical properties of NPC cells in vitro
caption: A The migration ability of circRILPL1 was examined in HNE2 cells after overexpression
  or knockdown of circRILPL1 by wound healing assay. Images were acquired at 0 and
  24 h. Scale bars = 200 μm. B The invasion ability of circRILPL1 was assessed in
  NPC cells after overexpression or knockdown of circRILPL1 by transwell assay. Scale
  bars =100 μm. C The effect of circRILPL1 on proliferation was evaluated in NPC cells
  after overexpression or knockdown of circRILPL1 by MTT assay. D Representative AFM
  deflection images (top) and representative three-dimensional height distribution
  images (bottom) of NPC cells. E, F The stiffness (N/m) and adhesion force (nN) of
  NPC cells were measured and analyzed by using JPK image processing software. All
  experiments were performed in at least triplicate samples. Data were presented as
  the means ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
