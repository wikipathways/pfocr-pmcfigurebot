caption: Pyruvate-based redox shuttles transfer matrix NADH equivalents to elevate
  cytosolic NADPH. (A) The pyruvate/malate redox shuttle (green arrows) and pyruvate/citrate
  shuttle (violet arrows). The pyruvate/malate redox shuttle bypasses PDH and the
  concomitant entry of the resulting acetyl-CoA into the Krebs cycle via the CS. This
  bypass exists due to the PC reaction producing OAA. Conditions upon glucose intake
  into pancreatic β-cells allow the reversed reaction of the matrix MDH2 that produces
  malate from oxaloacetate at the expense of NADH, which is converted to NAD+. That
  is why redox equivalents of NADH are transferred into cytosolic NADPH. The transfer
  is achieved by malate export via the “2-OGC” (SLC25A11) (), where it is exchanged
  for 2OG, which is then imported to the matrix. The exported malate increases the
  cytosolic malate pool, which can be consumed by the ME1 reaction, driven by NADP+
  and thus increasing the cytosolic NAPDH pool (, ). This reaction direction is driven
  by an instant return of pyruvate to the mitochondrial matrix ensured by the pyruvate
  carrier (MPC1 and MPC2, providing pyruvate-H+ symport). In this way, the cycle is
  achieved. The pyruvate/citrate shuttle is enabled by the citrate export from the
  matrix after the CS reaction (). This truncated Krebs cycle has been confirmed using
  13C-tracing, demonstrating that high amounts of the cytosolic citrate originate
  from glucose-derived acetyl-CoA (). Citrate is exported by the citrate carrier (“Cit
  C”; SLC25A1), enabling citrate antiport with malate. Together with the pyruvate/malate
  redox shuttle, malate cycling occurs. The exported citrate is split in the cytosol
  by the ACL with CoA, yielding oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. The cytosolic isoform
  of MDH1 then converts oxaloacetate into malate, which is again used by ME1 to produce
  NADPH and pyruvate, which is finally imported back to the matrix. The ACL reaction
  and hence shuttle operation is minor compared with the acetoacetate pathway operating
  upon GSIS (). Under low glucose conditions, levels of short-chain acyl-CoA are preserved.
  (B) The pyruvate/isocitrate shuttle (orange arrows) exists when the reductive carboxylation
  reaction of matrix IDH2 takes place. Unlike IDH3, which is the regular Krebs cycle
  enzyme providing NADH, IDH2 in a “forward” oxidative decarboxylation mode uses NADP+
  plus citrate and produces NADPH and 2OG in the matrix. At high [glucose], such conditions
  are established instead to facilitate the reverse IDH2 reaction, which is the NADPH-driven
  reductive carboxylation of 2OG in the presence of CO2 (). This is also facilitated
  by the Krebs cycle truncation, leaving a slow aconitase reaction and isocitrate
  formation so that the reverse IDH2 reaction occurs. The citrate carrier finally
  exports isocitrate to the cytosol, exchanging it for imported malate. The enhanced
  isocitrate pool in the β-cell cytosol is concomitantly consumed by the cytosolic
  IDH1, ensuring the NADP+-driven oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2OG,
  yielding NADPH (). As a result, IDH1 within this shuttle contributes to another
  portion of the cytosolic NADPH increase upon GSIS (). 2OG, as with the pyruvate/malate
  shuttle, is imported to the matrix, being exchanged for malate again by the oxoglutarate
  carrier. 2OG thus contributes to the mitochondrial matrix 2OG pool, consumed massively
  by the 2OGDH complex within the Krebs cycle. However, a portion of the matrix 2OG
  pool is used for another cycle of this shuttle, that is, for IDH2-mediated reductive
  carboxylation. 2OG, 2-oxoglutarate; 2OGC, 2-oxoglutarate carrier, mitochondrial;
