caption: CELF2 is the upstream regulation factor of MAPK signalling pathway, PI3K/AKT
  signalling pathway, autophagy and ERAD pathway, which can promote cancer cell ferroptosis
  through these pathways. CELF2, CUGBP, ELAV-like family number 2; ERAD, endoplasmic-reticulum-associated
  protein degradation; NFATc1, nuclear factor of activated T-cell c1; FAM198B, family
  with sequence similarity 198, member B; ATG, autophagy related gene; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-triphosphate
