caption: Significantly, DE genes (identified by KEGG) were involved in the bacterial
  invasion of epithelial cells signaling pathway during 8-week S. gordonii infection.
  Red boxes indicate 25 significantly increased expression based on the miRNA profiles
  from NanoString analysis. Green boxes indicate no change in gene expression. Many
  pathogenic bacteria can invade phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells and colonize
  them intracellularly, then become disseminated to other cells. Invasive bacteria
  induce their uptake by non-phagocytic host cells (e.g., epithelial cells) using
  two mechanisms referred to as the zipper model and trigger model. Listeria, Staphylococcus,
  Streptococcus, and Yersinia are examples of bacteria that can enter using the zipper
  model. These bacteria express proteins on their surfaces that interact with cellular
  receptors, initiating signaling cascades that result in close apposition of the
  cellular membrane around the entering bacteria. Shigella and Salmonella are examples
  of bacteria entering cells using the trigger model. An arrow indicates a molecular
  interaction and a line without an arrowhead indicates a molecular interaction resulting
  in inhibition
