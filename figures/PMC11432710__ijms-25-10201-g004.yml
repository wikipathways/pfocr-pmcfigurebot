caption: Circulating Fatty Acids Profile. GCMS analysis of circulating FAs showed
  similar SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs distribution between vitiligo patients and controls
  (A); vitiligo patients showed alteration in PUFAs composition characterized by an
  increase in the level of n6-series FAs such as GLA and AA (B) and by a decrease
  in the level of n3-series FAs in particular EPA (C). An imbalance in FA metabolic
  pathway was demonstrated by the alteration observed for the estimated desaturase
  and elongase activities, with the increase in n6/n3 index (D). Data are represented
  as mean ± SD (* p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01)
