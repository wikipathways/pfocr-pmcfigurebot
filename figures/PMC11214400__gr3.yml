caption: Altered MEK/ERK/KLF4 axis in nicastrin (NCSTN) knockdown HaCaT cells and
  the NCSTN/MEK/ERK deficiency in familial AI patient lesion.(A) The expression levels
  of MAPK signaling pathway molecules (ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, MEK1/2, and p-MEK1/2) and
  downstream KLF4 were analyzed by western blotting in NCSTN knockdown HaCaT cells.
  (B) Painful subcutaneous nodules, abscesses, sinus, and scars in the axillary and
  groin area of the proband and the family tree reveal the affected individuals in
  the AI family. (C) Immunohistochemistry revealed the NCSTN, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 expression
  levels in the proband patient of a Chinese AI family. Original magnification × 100
  (NCSTN, MEK1/2); × 200 (ERK1/2). (D) Immunofluorescence revealed the KLF4 expression
  in the epidermis of familial AI lesions (original magnification × 200). Results
  are expressed as means ± standard deviations (n = 3).
