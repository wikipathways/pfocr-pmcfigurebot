figure_title: Schematic illustration of ferroptosis signaling pathway.
caption: Schematic illustration of ferroptosis signaling pathway. Ferroptosis starts
  with Fe3+-bound transferrin (Tf) endocytosis via transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1).
  After endocytosis, Fe3+ is released from the Tf–TfR1 complex and is reduced to Fe2+
  by endosomal metalloreductase, STEAP. Fe2+ can be transported and stored in ferritin
  by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1 or SLC11A2) or remain in the cytoplasm as
  a labile iron (Fe2+) pool (LIP). Fe2+-/Fe3+-catalyzed Fenton reaction generates
  the hydroxyl radical (OH•) that reacts with membrane lipids (the free polyunsaturated
  fatty acids or PUFA-OH) and produces lipid peroxidation product, PUFA-OOH. Lipid
  peroxidation can also occur via enzymes such as lipoxygenases (LOXs) such as 15-LOX-1
  isoform and P450 oxidoreductase. Ferroptosis can be interdicted by iron chelators,
  antioxidants, and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) that converts PUFA-OOH back to
  PUFA-OH, using glutathione (GSH) as a substrate. GSH synthesis occurs via the entry
  of cystine into the cell by system Xc− [36]. Created with BioRender.com
