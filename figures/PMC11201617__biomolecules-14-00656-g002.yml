figure_title: Canonical activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway.
caption: Canonical activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway. (a) In the absence of
  WNT/β-catenin cascade activation, there is an intracytoplasmic pool of β-catenin
  that is phosphorylated by a protein complex, known as the “destruction complex”
  (formed from the GSK-3β, Axin, APC, and CKI1α proteins) that will ubiquitinate the
  β-catenin, undergoing proteasomal degradation. As a result, β-catenin does not interact
  with the transcription factors. (b) When the Frizzled receptor binds any member
  of the WNT ligand family (WNT 1, 2, 3, 8a, 8b, 10a, 10b), it activates the pathway
  and β-catenin is translocated to the nucleus, where it interacts with the transcription
  factors (TCF/LEF, Pygo, Bcl-9, Gro/TLE) that in turn trans-activate (arrow) genes
  known to be associated with cell development, proliferation, and WNT regulation.

  lymphoma 9 protein; Gro/TLE—Drosophila Groucho/transducin-like enhancers of split;
  GLUL—glutamate-ammonia ligase; TBX3—T-box transcription factor 3; OAT—ornithine
  aminotransferase; HIF-1α—hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha; FOXO—forkhead
  box protein O1; SOX—SRY-related HMG-box genes; AXIN 2 gene; SP5—Sp5 transcription
