caption: Hydroxytyrosol (HT) activated mitophagy to regulate oxidative stress in piglets
  and IPEC-J2 cells. (A) Protein expression and quantitation of PINK1, Parkin, Beclin1,
  p62, LC3 I/II, ATG5, and ATG7 were determined by western blotting in IPEC-J2 cells
  treated with Nrf2 pathway inhibitor ML385. (B) Cellular ultrastructure in the piglet's
  colon was visualized using TEM (4,000 × magnification). Red arrows indicate mitophagosomes.
  (C-D) Protein expression and quantitation of PINK1, Parkin, Beclin1, p62, LC3 I/II,
  ATG5, and ATG7 were determined by western blotting in the intestinal mucosa of piglets.
  (E) Cellular ultrastructure in IPEC-J2 cells was visualized using TEM (4,000 × magnification).
  Red arrows indicate mitophagosomes. (F-G) Protein expression and quantitation of
  PINK1, Parkin, Beclin1, p62, LC3 I/II, ATG5, and ATG7 were determined by western
  blotting in IPEC-J2 cells. Values are means ± SE. Different letters and * represent
  significant differences (P < 0.05)
