  SOX18 regulates DPC proliferation via the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. (a) Detection of mRNA level of CTNNB1 following the inhibiting of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway in DPCs. (b) TOP/FOP-flash assays of the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway activity in DPCs treated with/without 30 µM ICG001. (c,d) EdU assay of DPCs treated with/without 30 µM ICG001. The scale is 100 µm. (e,f) EdU assay after DPCs were treated with pcDNA 3.1-SOX18 + 30 µM ICG001, 30 µM ICG001, and pcDNA 3.1. The scale is 100 µm. The data are presented as means ± SEM (standard error of the mean) (n = 3). The statistical significance was assessed using the unpaired Student’s t-test. (*
