figure_title: UA suppressed the growth of spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma by
  inhibiting the ING5- induced PI3K/Akt pathway.
caption: UA suppressed the growth of spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting
  the ING5- induced PI3K/Akt pathway. (A) The schematic figure shows the activation
  of T-antigen targeted in hepatocytes with a LacZ deletion by a cre-loxp system (left)
  and PCR of tail DNA from Alb/JCPyV T antigen transgenic mice shows their genotype
  (right). (B) The schedule demonstrates that spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) mice were administered vehicle, 50 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg UA at 18 weeks of age.
  (C) Representative ultrasonography images of mice with spontaneous HCC at 28 and
  30 weeks of age, and liver images at 32 weeks of age. (D) Liver/body weight ratios
  and numbers of tumor nodules were measured (*P < 0.01, **P < 0.001). (E) The histological
  appearance, apoptosis and proliferation of HCC tissues were assessed by HE staining,
  TUNEL and Ki-67 immunostaining, respectively (***P < 0.001 vs. control group. Scale
  bar =50 Î¼m). (F) Plasma AST and ALT levels were detected by ELISA (***P < 0.001).
  (G) The expression levels of T antigen, ING5, Akt and p-Akt in HCC tissues from
  Alb/JCPyV T antigen transgenic mice were analyzed by western blotting. Each group
  contained 6 mice. Differences were analyzed by Student's t test. M, marker. WT,
  wild-type. PC, positive control. NC, negative control. wks, weeks. TUNEL, terminal
  deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
