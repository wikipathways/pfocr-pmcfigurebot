caption: DHA signaling pathways in neuron survival, morphology, and synaptic function.
  (A) DHA can promote neuron survival by different mechanisms, including the induction
  of cAMP response element-binding (CREB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2 (NRF2) pathways, or apoptosis inhibition by reducing the activities of caspase-3
  and caspase-8. (B) Regarding neural morphology, DHA can trigger the activation of
  retinoid X receptor (RXR) and the G-protein coupled receptor GPR40/FFAR1, which
  can increase intracellular calcium by activation of Gq/PLC/IP3 or by activation
  of the tyrosine kinase Trk-B receptor (Trk-B-R) by its activator, brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with subsequent activation of the CREB pathway. This
  latter axis can also be activated by the DHA metabolite DEA (synaptomide), which
  induces a GPR110-mediated increase in cAMP levels. (C) The effects of DHA and DEA
  on synaptic function include the expression of synaptic proteins, such as postsynaptic
  receptors or scaffolding proteins (left scheme), which lead to an enhancement of
  synaptic communication (middle scheme). Additionally, DHA exert a direct effect
  on ion channels, modulating their gating properties (right scheme). Whether DEA
  is also able to modulate the activity of ion channels is unknown.
