caption: Poly(I:C) induces TLR3 and NF-κB signaling pathway activation. (A) BEAS-2B
  cells were stimulated with 10 μg/mL of poly(I:C) to assess TLR3 phosphorylation.
  (B) Relative protein expressions of phosphorylated TLR3 (p-TLR3), TLR3 and p-TLR3/TLR3
  were measured at specific time points and normalized to GAPDH. Data represent the
  mean ± standard deviation (SD) from three independent experiments, with results
  normalized to untreated control cells. Statistical significance was assessed using
  Student’s t-test, ** p < 0.01 vs. untreated control cells. (C) Representative Western
  blot depicting the protein levels of phosphorylated IκB-α (p-IκB-α) and IκB-α in
  poly(I:C)-treated BEAS-2B cells over time. (D) Quantitative analysis of p-IκB-α,
  IκB-α and p-IκB-α/IκB-α expression levels normalized to GAPDH. Data are the mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments, and the results normalized to untreated control
  cells. Statistical analysis was performed via Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01 vs. untreated control cells
