figure_title: Fusobacterium affects chemotherapy drugs.
caption: 'Fusobacterium affects chemotherapy drugs. Through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88) of the TLR signaling pathway, Fusobacterium
  nucleatum induces the selective loss of two autophagy-related microRNAs (microRNA-18a
  [miR-18a] and microRNA-4802 [miR-4802MYD88]), which activate autophagy, thereby
  reducing the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Fn.: Fusobacterium
  nucleatum; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; miR-18a*: ‘*’ represents the by-product with
  a relatively low content; L-OHP: Oxaliplatin. By Figdraw, www.figdraw.com (accessed
