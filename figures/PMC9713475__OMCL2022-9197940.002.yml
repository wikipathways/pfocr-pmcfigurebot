caption: 'Limiting the number of Mets improves the pathological environment of the
  injured area. (a) H&E and Nissl staining of the injured area in Sham, SCI, and DNase
  I groups at 7 days after the operation. The black boxes point to the local tissue
  magnification. Scale bars of H&E staining: 500 μm, 100 μm. Scale bar of Nissl staining:
  500 μm. H&E staining: hematoxylin-eosin staining. (b) Representative scatterplot
  of the ratio of the cavity area. The ratio of the cavity area in the DNase I group
  is lower than that in the SCI group but higher than that in the Sham group. Data
  are exhibited as Mean ± SD (n = 6).  ∗P < 0.05, vs. Sham group; #P < 0.05 vs. SCI
  group. (c) Scatterplot of the number of Nissl bodies. The number of Nissl bodies
  in the DNase I group is higher than that in the SCI group but lower than that in
  the Sham group. Data are shown as Mean ±SD (n = 6).  ∗P < 0.05 vs. Sham group; #P
  < 0.05 vs. SCI group. (d) TUNEL staining of the injured area in the Sham, SCI, and
  DNase I groups at 7 days after the operation. Dead cells (green), nuclear (blue).
  Scale bar: 50 μm. (e) Typical scatterplot of the fluorescence area of TUNEL+ cells.
  The fluorescence area of TUNEL+ cells in the DNase I group is lower than that in
  the SCI group but higher than that in the Sham group. Data are presented as Mean ± SD
  (n = 6).  ∗P < 0.05 vs. Sham group; #P < 0.05 vs. SCI group.'
