caption: 'Metabolomic pathways of the cell. Glucose enters the cell through the bloodstream
  via GLUT1 transporters. Glucose then is broken down by glycolysis producing 2 ATPs
  and pyruvate. Pyruvate is then transferred to the TCA cycle, which generates NADH
  and FADH. NADH and FADH transfer their electrons through oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) to generate ATP. Fatty acids are broken down as an alternative form of
  energy for the cell. Fatty acids enter the cell through membrane transporters. Fatty
  acids then undergo beta-oxidation, which results in the production of acetyl-CoA.
  Acetyl-CoA then enters the TCA cycle, which again produces NADH and FADH to use
  in the OXPHOS pathway. Abbreviations: FAS: fatty acid synthetase; HKII: hexokinase
  II; ATP: adenosine triphosphate.'
