figure_title: Gene expression in the core dauer pathway is robust
caption: 'A. Density plot of the Coefficient of Variation (CV) of genes in the core
  dauer pathway. Labels of the pathway on top. X-axis: CVs of all genes in the pathway
  computed by dividing the standard deviation (SD) of its expression across all dauers
  by its mean expression across all dauers. Dotted lines demarcating CVs: low, (CV
  < 30), moderate (30 < CV < 50), high (CV > 50). Y-axis (left) density.B. Dumbbell
  Plot showing Spearman’s correlation coefficient (rho) between pairs of dauers in
  ‘core’ dauer pathways. TOP labels: the pair of dauers compared. Y-axis: pathway.
  X-axis: rho value and confidence interval (CI): blue dot represents lower CI, yellow
  dot represents rho value, and red dot represents high CI. p-values, Bonferroni corrected.
  *p-value <0.05; ns, not-significant'
