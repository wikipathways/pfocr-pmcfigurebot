caption: 'Detection of Nrf2-related signaling pathway proteins in jejunum. (A) Western
  blot detection results of Nrf2 signaling pathway proteins in the jejunum. (B) Expression
  of Nrf2 signaling pathway proteins relative to GADPH protein. Means were considered
  to be significantly different at * p < 0.05 and #Â p < 0.05, and highly significant
  difference at ** p < 0.01'
