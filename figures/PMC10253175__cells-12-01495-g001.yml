figure_title: Mechanisms of T Lymphocyte Depletion and Pancreatic Damage in Acute
  Pancreatitis.
caption: 'Mechanisms of T Lymphocyte Depletion and Pancreatic Damage in Acute Pancreatitis.
  This figure illustrates the depletion of circulating T lymphocytes in acute pancreatitis
  development due to the following two primary factors: increased apoptosis of T lymphocytes
  caused by heightened Fas/FasL signaling pathway and caspase activation, and enhanced
  T cell homing to inflamed tissues through rolling, chemokine-mediated activation,
  and firm adhesion. As a result, the inflamed pancreas experiences increased T cells
  that directly and indirectly damage the pancreatic parenchyma, with direct damage
  mediated by CD8+ T cells and FasL/Fas interactions, and indirect damage mediated
  by Th1 and Th17 cells that stimulate macrophage activation and neutrophil influx,
  respectively'
