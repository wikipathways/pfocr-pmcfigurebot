caption: Functional characterization and profiling of TAM subsets in YUMM1.7 melanoma
  tumors. (a) Heatmap with hierarchical clustering of TAM subpopulations based on
  z-score-transformed gene expression from bulk RNA-seq. F4/80high and F4/80low subsets
  were isolated from 10 pooled tumors and RNA-seq data were collected in 3 independent
  experiments. (b) Volcano plot showing the top 50 differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) between F4/80high and F4/80low subsets (p-adj < 0.05, abs(log2FoldChange(FC))
  > 1). (c,d) GSEA Hallmark gene sets from the mouse MSigDB, with an FDR < 25% for
  the F4/80high and F4/80low TAM DEGs (NES = normalized enrichment score, FDR = false
  discovery rate). (e) Enrichment of F4/80high (right, red) and F4/80low (left, blue)
  DEGs (protein-coding genes only) for KEGG metabolic pathway terms. Bar lengths represent
  associated z-score. (f) PCA embedding of TAM samples from cytokine/chemokine functional
  profiling, assessed by bead-based multiplex secretion assay (PC2 vs. PC1, top; PC3
  vs. PC2, bottom). Samples clearly separated by TAM subset along PC2, which explained
  26.7% of variability in the data. (g) Heatmap of natural log-transformed protein
  secretion from (f). Hierarchical clustering identified 7 functional clusters across
  TAM subsets
