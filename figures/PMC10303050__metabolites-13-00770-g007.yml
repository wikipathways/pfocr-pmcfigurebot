caption: Overview of metabolic changes of key central carbon pathways in the leaves
  of Scotia tomato seedlings treated with pyroligneous acid (PA) under aluminum (Al)
  stress. Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; 3PGA, 3-phosphoglyceric acid; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  F1,6BP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate;
  Se7BP, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate; Se7P, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate;
  RuBP, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; 2PG, 2-phosphoglyceric acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvic acid; 6PGlu, 6-phosphogluconate;
  Xu5P, xylulose-5-phosphate; NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; FMN,
  flavin mono-nucleotides; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; ADP, adenosine diphosphate;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate. The red colour of the metabolic pattern represents
  a lower concentration, and the green colour represents a higher concentration of
  a particular metabolite. The treatments that match the corresponding colour patterns
  were arranged from left to right as control (C), 1 mM Al (1), 4 mM Al (4), 0.25%
  PA (A), 0.25% PA + 1 mM Al (A1), 0.25% PA + 4 mM Al (A4), 1% PA (B), 1% PA + 1 mM
  Al (B1) and 1% PA + 4 mM Al (B4)
