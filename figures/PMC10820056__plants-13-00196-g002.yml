figure_title: Relative expression of the genes in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway
  of tea plant leaves.
caption: 'Relative expression of the genes in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway of
  tea plant leaves. (Aâ€“F): The relative expression of F3Ha, F3Hb, DFRa, DFRb, ANSa,
  and ANSb genes, respectively. (G): Schematic drawing of one bud and one leaf, one
  bud and two leaves, and one bud and three leaves. Note: the bar chart shows the
  mean of the three biological replicates, and the error bars are standard deviations,
  and the asterisks indicate statistical difference in one-way analysis of variance
  (ns p < 0.1234, *** p < 0.0002, **** p < 0.0001)'
