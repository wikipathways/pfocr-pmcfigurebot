figure_title: Biological processes that explain differences in Alu editing
caption: 'A Single-sample scores were generated for 10,493 Gene Ontology Biological
  Processes. These pathway scores were regressed onto the AEI while covarying for
  known biological and technical factors. Reported BH adjusted p values and t statistics
  were derived from a moderated t test comparing pathway scores between living and
  postmortem tissue. The t statistics (x-axis) for each biological process relative
  to strength of association with the AEI (y axis; −log10 adjusted p value). Pathways
  with an absolute t statistic >7 and FDR adjusted p value < 0.05 were deemed significant
  (blue, negative association; red, positive association). B A density distribution
  of t statistics illustrates most pathways are positive predictors of the AEI (top)
  and REVIGO semantic similarity representation of the top positive 1688 pathways
  (bottom,). Multiple broad groupings emerge that map to intra-cellular signaling,
  apoptosis, hypoxia, cellular metabolism, and innate immune/inflammatory responses.
  Colors indicate the adjusted P value of the enriched GO terms. The size of each
  bubble shows the GO terms with more significant P values. C Single-sample scores
  that represent top pathways from each cluster also predict differences between living
  and postmortem (PM) tissues. D Pearson’s correlation coefficient illustrates regressions
  of single-sample pathway score onto the AEI for the top six candidate pathways.
  All Living Brain Project data encompassed 164 and 233 biologically independent samples
  from living and postmortem sources, respectively. E Validating the interaction between
  interferon-γ and the AEI. Two-dimensional (2D) hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells
  (NPCs; day 18) and mature neurons (day 30) treated with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)
  (PMID: 32875100). Data was generated by bulk RNA-seq from n = 3 biological replicates.
  F Validating the interaction between hypoxia and the AEI. Three-dimensional (3D)
  model of human cortical spheroids (hCS) exposed to differing degrees of hypoxia
  (PMID: 31061540). Data was generated by bulk RNA-seq from n = 8 biological replicates.
  E, F Two-sided linear regression was used to test for significance. All boxplots
  in this figure show the medians (horizontal lines), upper and lower quartiles (inner
  box edges), and 1.5× the interquartile range (whiskers).'
