caption: Transcription Factors and Signaling Pathways in the Process of EMT. Throughout
  the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), regulation encompasses a
  diverse array of transcription factors and signaling pathways. The principal transcription
  factors encompass the Snail family, Twist family, and the zinc-finger E-box binding
  (ZEB) transcription factor family. Furthermore, this regulatory process involves
  the Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family, Forkhead box (Fox) family, SRY-related HMG-box
  (SOX) family, RUNX family, and GATA family. During EMT, a multitude of extracellular
  and intracellular proteins activate various intracellular signaling pathways, thereby
  modulating the expression of these transcription factors and facilitating the progression
  of EMT
