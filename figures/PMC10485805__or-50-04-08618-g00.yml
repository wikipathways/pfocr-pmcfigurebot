figure_title: Intestinal flora regulates tumor microenvironment components.
caption: 'Intestinal flora regulates tumor microenvironment components. TAMs: Helicobacter
  hepaticus can activate TAMs and inhibit the production of IL-10, thus inhibiting
  the development of breast cancer. The imbalance of gut microbiota directly activates
  macrophages, macrophages release IL-6, TNF-α and CXCL10. IL-6 and TNF-α accelerate
  the development of CRC by promoting EMT, while CXCL10 induces T-cell infiltration
  in the tumor microenvironment and promotes the development of HCC. Intestinal microbiota
  bacterial diseases induce tumor cells to secrete CTSK, thereby activating macrophages
  through mTOR-dependent pathways. CTSK stimulates the macrophage secretion of IL-10
  and IL-17, thus promoting the invasion and metastasis of CRC cells. Some symbiotic
  microbiota stimulate macrophages to increase c-Jun phosphorylation in CRC cells
  through the JNK signaling pathway, thus accelerating CRC cell proliferation. Intestinal
  microbiota bacterial diseases also induce the production of IL-25 from cluster cells,
  which promotes EMT and the migration of HCC cells. CAFs: CAFs influence the tumor
  immune microenvironment by recruiting chemokines and immune factors. MDSCs: IL-17
  recruits bone MDSCs into the colon tumor microenvironment of mice colonized with
  enterotoxin bacteria, which indirectly induce the ectopic production of chemokines
  and growth factors through direct interaction with IL-17 receptors in CECs, and
  the expression of IL-17 in submucosa. IL-17 and transformed CECs jointly promote
  tumor development with angiogenic mediators, namely MMP-9 and VEGF, by inhibiting
  immune effector cells and activating the STAT3 signaling pathway. Early lack of
  microbiota in mice enhances the expression of C-X-C motif receptor 2 ligands. A
  number of gut pathogenic microorganisms or gut microbiota and their synergistic
  interactions with cytokines activate and proliferate MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment,
  thus mediating the immune escape of tumor cells. TANs: Helicobacter hepaticus can
  induce the generation of neutrophils, thereby inducing nitric oxide and TNF-α increased
  content, which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway and promotes tumor generation.
  DCs: Lipopolysaccharide and TNF-α stimulate DCs to mature and activate, and subsequently
  activate T cells to produce IL-2 to form an antitumor microenvironment. TAMs, tumor-associated
  macrophages; CRC, colorectal cancer; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; HCC,
  hepatocellular carcinoma; CTSK, carnosine K; CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts;
  MDSCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells; CECs, colon epithelial cells; DCs, dendritic
  cells; TANs, tumor-associated neutrophils; CXCL, C-X-C motif ligand'
