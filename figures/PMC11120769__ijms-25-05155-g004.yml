  transporters and the adipokine system in rat ovaries.
caption: 'Transcriptome data and correlation analysis of the expression of glucose
  transporters and the adipokine system in rat ovaries. (A) Volcanic map analysis
  of transcriptome data. Blue: represents no significant difference. (B) KEGG pathway
  analysis; (C) correlation analysis of genes related to the glucose metabolism signaling
  pathway and adipokine signaling pathway. (D) Gene transcription levels of Slc2a1,
  Slc2a2, Slc2a3, Slc2a4, Adipor1, and Adipor2 in the ovaries of rats in the eCG-treated
  and blank control groups. (E) Protein levels of GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4, AdipoR1,
  and AdipoR2 in the ovaries of rats in the eCG-treated and blank control groups.
  The error bars represent means Â± SEM (n = 3, each group). * Statistically significant
  values (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001); ns represents
  no significance'
