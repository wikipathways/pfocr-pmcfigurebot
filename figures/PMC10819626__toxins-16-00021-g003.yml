figure_title: Livisin activates the CasR/E-cadherin signaling pathway.
caption: Livisin activates the CasR/E-cadherin signaling pathway. (a) Effect of livisin
  on the protein expression level of CaSR. Keratinocytes were treated with 5 × 10−10
  M livisin for different durations. The plot besides the blot quantitatively compares
  the extent of CaSR over time in a grey scale; (b) effect of livisin on the protein
  expression level E-cadherin. Keratinocytes were treated with 5 × 10−10 M livisin
  for different durations. The plot besides the blot quantitatively compares the extent
  of E-cadherin over time in the grey scale; (c) keratinocytes are pretreated with
  CaSR-specific inhibitor NPS2143 (1 nM) for 12 h, followed by stimulation with 5
  × 10−10 M livisin. The protein expression of E-cadherin was detected by Western
  blotting. The plot besides the blot quantitatively compares the extent of E-cadherin
  in greyscale; (d) effect of livisin on the level of CaSR mRNA in HaCaT cells as
  determined by Q-PCR; (e) changes in intracellular Ca2+ level of HaCaT cells after
  treatment with livisin in the absence and presence of 1.2 mM Ca2+. In all experiments,
  the cells were treated with livisin at 5 × 10−10 M for 1 h. All graphical data are
  the means ± SEMs from three determinations. “**”, “***”, and “****” indicate significant
  differences from the control cells at the p < 0.01, p < 0.001, and p < 0.0001 levels,
  respectively
