figure_title: Molecular mechanisms of autophagy triggered by excess Cu.
caption: Molecular mechanisms of autophagy triggered by excess Cu. The cellular uptake
  of excess Cu through CTR1 regulates the autophagy mechanism. Cu increases the AMP/ATP
  ratio to inhibit mTOR and disrupts the binding between mTOR and ULK1 complexes.
  Cu also activates the CCS/SOD1 and COX17/SCO1/2 pathways, as well as the ATOX1/ATP7A/ATP7B
  pathways. The induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress by Cu disturbs the fusion
  phase of autophagy. Furthermore, Cu hinders the degradation phase of autophagy through
  a complex mechanism
