figure_title: OTUB1 interacts with β-catenin and regulates its stability.
caption: OTUB1 interacts with β-catenin and regulates its stability. A. Heatmap of
  RNA-seq expression data for EJ cell transfected with control or shOTUB1 lentivirus.
  B. GSEA of RNA-seq data revealed that OTUB1 target genes were involved in Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. C, D. Relative expression of β-catenin following overexpressed
  or knockdown OTUB1. E. Relative expression of β-catenin following overexpressed
  or knockdown OTUB1 (treated with or without MG132 for 8h). F. Relative expression
  of β-catenin following overexpressed or knockdown OTUB1 (treated with MG132 or chloroquine
  for 8h). G. Relative expression of β-catenin following overexpressed or knockdown
  OTUB1 (treated with or without CHX for 0h, 4h, 8h and 24h). H. Relative mRNA expression
  of OTUB1 and β-catenin following knockdown OTUB1. I. The interaction between OTUB1
  and β-catenin was determined by a co-immunoprecipitation assay
