caption: LATS2 mediates the reduction in GSH levels by targeting PSAT1 in HB cells.
  (A-C) HepG2 and HUH6 cells were transfected with LATS2. YAP1 was simultaneously
  overexpressed, and ferroptosis-related metabolic parameters, including the GSH concentration
  (A), phospholipid level (B), and iron concentration (C), were measured. (D-F) The
  relative levels of glycine (D), cysteine (E), and glutamine were measured under
  the indicated conditions. (G) Transcriptional levels of the key enzymes of the serine
  synthesis pathway were screened by qRT‒PCR after LATS2 overexpression, with or without
  YAP1 overexpression. (H) The expression of LATS2, YAP1, and PSAT1 was measured by
  WB under the indicated conditions. (I) CCK-8 assays were conducted after LATS2 overexpression,
  with or without PSAT1 overexpression. (J and K) Lipid ROS levels were measured by
  C11-Bodipy staining coupled with flow cytometry under the indicated treatments.
  All quantitative data are shown as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.
