caption: Nitrogen Metabolism. (a) Table depicting the fold change ratio of nitrogen
  metabolism intermediates between 0 G vs. 1 G secretomes after 3 days of incubation.
  Nitrogen metabolites are divided into urea cycle, creatine metabolism, and polyamine
  metabolism pathways. Values in red rectangles represent increased levels of the
  metabolites in space compared to ground control, whereas green rectangles highlight
  the opposite and white rectangles represent no change. (b) Scheme of the integrated
  nitrogen metabolism
