caption: 'Roles of NLRC3 on macrophage: Upon the infection of gram-negative bacteria,
  NLRC3 decreases the activation of the NF-κB signal pathway and the release of multiple
  inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 by TRAF6-dependent manner. Upon the
  infection of the virus, NLRC3 prevents the activation of STING/TBK1 signal pathway
  and the following release of I-IFN through inhibiting STING and TBK1 from functioning
  normally. Upon the PAMPs stimulation, NLRC3 competitively binding ASC and pro-CASP1
  with NLRP3 prevents the formation of inflammasome and pyroptosis.'
