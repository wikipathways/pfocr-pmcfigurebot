  on levels of the down-stream proteins of the FABP5 signalling pathway.
caption: Effect of AR-KO on the malignant characteristics of 22RV1 cells and on levels
  of the down-stream proteins of the FABP5 signalling pathway. (A) Microscopical appearances
  of 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO. (B) Effect of AR-KO on proliferation of 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO
  cells. (C) Effect of AR-KO on 22RV1 cell invasion. (D) Average number of invasive
  cells from 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO cells. (E) Effect of AR knockout on anchorage-independent
  growth of 22RV1 cells. (F) Relative numbers of colonies formed in soft agar by 22RV1
  and 22RV1-AR-KO cells. (G) Effect of AR-KO on gap closure of 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO
  cells. (H) Quantitative assessment of average sizes of the wound space or gap in
  22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO cells in μm at different times. (I) Western blot analysis
  of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 in 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO cells. (J) Relative levels of PPARγ1
  and PPARγ2 in 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO cells. (K) Western blot analysis of pPPARγ1
  and pPPARγ2 in 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO cells. (L) Quantitative assessment of levels
  of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2 proteins. Levels of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2 in 22RV1 were set
  at '1', and the levels in 22RV1AR-KO cells were obtained by comparing with those
  in 22RV1. (M) Western blot analysis of VEGF in 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO cells. (N)
  Relative levels of VEGF in 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO cells. The level of VEGF in 22RV1
  cells was set at '1', and that in 22RV1-AR-KO cells was obtained by comparing with
  that in 22RV1. (O) Western blot detection of FABP5 protein in 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO
  cells (no quantification was made, since the level in 22RV1-FABP5-KO cells was negligible).
  The protein relative levels were reproduced independently three times, and the differences
  were assessed by Student's t-test. *P<0.05, ***P<0.0001 and ****P<0.00001. KO, knockout;
  FABP5, fatty acid-binding protein 5; AR, androgen receptor; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ; pPPARγ, phosphorylated PPARγ; VEGF, vascular endothelium growth factor;
  ns, not statistically significant
