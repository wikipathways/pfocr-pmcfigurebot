caption: (a) Overview of PrestoBlue cell viability assay in RTgill‐W1 cells after
  different time durations of OMVs treatment. Approximately 500,000 cells/well were
  seeded in 96‐well plates for 24 h. Cells were then treated with OMVs or Nuclease‐free
  water (NFW; control group) for 0 min, 6, 12 and 24 h at 18°C. Cell culture medium
  was used as a blank for the PrestoBlue Assay. PrestoBlue reagent was added to wells,
  followed by incubation at appropriate temperatures and absorbance measurement at
  570 nm wavelength to determine cell viability. (b) PrestoBlue cell viability assay
  in OMVs treated RTgill‐W1 cells showed that the cytotoxicity increases with increased
  time duration of OMVs exposure. Significant cytotoxicity was observed at 12 and
  24 h (p < 0.05). (c) Approximately 1.2 × 106 RTgill‐W1 cells/well were seeded in
  6‐well tissue culture plates and maintained overnight at 18°C. Cells were exposed
  to either OMVs or NFW (control group) for 6, 12 and 24 h at 18°C. The media from
  the ‛control’ and ‛treated’ cell wells were removed, and cells were washed, trypsinised
  and then lysed with Trizol reagent for RNA extraction and sequencing on day 1 post‐treatment.
  (d) A Volcano plot showing the host transcripts DE on day 1 following OMVs treatment
  in RTgill‐W1 cells. The red dots represent the upregulated transcripts in the OMV‐treated
  cells, whereas the blue dots represent the downregulated transcripts at FDR ≤0.05.
  Heat maps showing DE transcripts involved in chaperones and folding catalysts (e),
  membrane trafficking and endocytic pathway (f) and phagocytosis and antigen processing
  and presentation (g).
