caption: Molecular structure and characterization of armored-T cells in vitro. (A)
  Preparation, versatility and killing pathway of armored-T cells. Armored-T cells
  was prepared using lentiviral infection, followed by amplification and incubation
  with mAbs to form drug conjugates which were then transfused back into patients.
  There was no need to redesign the CAR molecule. The only need was to replace the
  mAb according to different indications, for effective killing of the tumor cells.
  Led by mAbs, Armored-T cells infiltrated tumor tissues and killed tumor cells through
  ADCC, Fas/FasL and cytokines. (B) Schematic representation of the chimeric FcγRI-CAR
  receptor constructs. The chimeric receptor comprised the extracellular domain of
  FcγRI, the hinge of CD8, the transmembrane domain of CD28, and two co-stimulatory
  domains containing CD28 and 4–1BB in tandem with the ζ-chain of the TCR/CD3 complex.
  (C) Expression of FcγRI-CAR in CD3+ human T cells, as assayed by staining with biotin-Fc
  and PE-conjugated streptavidin. The cells were analyzed using flow cytometry.
