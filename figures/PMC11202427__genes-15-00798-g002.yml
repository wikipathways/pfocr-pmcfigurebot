caption: The WNT signaling pathway. Illustration of the WNT signaling pathway in the
  on and off state. When the WNT signaling pathway is inactive, the destruction complex
  consisting of Gsk3β, Axin, and APC phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to ubiquitination
  of β-catenin and eventual proteasomal degradation by the proteasome. In the active
  pathway, WNT ligands bind to the transmembrane frizzled receptor and LRP, which
  then sequester the destruction complex away from phosphorylating β-catenin. This
  allows β-catenin to translocate into the nucleus, interacting with TCF/LEF proteins
  to activate the expression of WNT target genes. Created with BioRender.com
