caption: Downstream effectors of RTK-mediated pathways and their biological consequences.
  Upon receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) stimulation by their corresponding ligands,
  both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Grb2/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways can be activated
  in melanoma. The activation of PI3K/AKT and NRAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathways by RTKs
  can promote several cellular functions via the activation of MDM2, NF-κB, and CREB
  to enhance p53 degradation as well as promote the transcription of proliferative
  and anti-apoptotic genes. PI3K/AKT-induced activation of mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP1,
  the inhibitor of elF-4E, to allow the release of the active form of elf-4E to initiate
  the translation processes of angiogenic or cell cycle gene targets. PI3K/AKT can
  inhibit the phosphorylation of downstream effectors, namely caspase-9, GSK-3ß, p27,
  and p21 to induce cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis
