figure_title: Eicosanoids at baseline (BL) and reaction (Rxn) were correlated with
  airway ILC2 accumulation following aspirin desensitization.
caption: Eicosanoids at baseline (BL) and reaction (Rxn) were correlated with airway
  ILC2 accumulation following aspirin desensitization. Spearman correlations between
  lipid mediators and airway ILC2 percentages were calculated before and during COX-1
  inhibition. A-D, Heatmaps of these correlations separated on the basis of metabolic
  pathway. E and F, Linear regressions of correlations of select mediators and ILC2s.
