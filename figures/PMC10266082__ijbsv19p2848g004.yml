figure_title: Enhanced TGFβ signaling pathway in the cells of the lesions.
caption: 'Enhanced TGFβ signaling pathway in the cells of the lesions. A few bronchial
  epithelial cells were pSMAD2 positive in WT mice (A). In the lesion of LXRαβ-/-
  mouse lung, most of the cells were pSMAD2 nuclear-positive (A). Very few bronchial
  epithelial cells were SMAD4 positive in WT mice (B). Most of the cells in the lesion
  of LXRαβ-/- mouse were SMAD4 positive (B). The number of cells that expressing pSMAD2
  and SMAD4 was significantly higher than that in WT mice (C). RNA-seq data showed
  that in LXRαβ-/- mouse lung there was a significant upregulation of TGFβ1, TGFβR1,
  and TGFβR2 with a downregulation of TGFβR3 in mRNA level (D). (Scale bars in A,
  B, 50 μm. #, P<0.05)'
