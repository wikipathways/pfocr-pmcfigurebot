caption: Function of m6A modification on crop growth and development or stress resistance.
  (a) Regulation of rice m6A methyltransferase subunit OsFIP on microspore development.
  OsFIP‐mediated m6A installation decreases the expression of genes encoding the threonine
  proteases and NTPases, thereby maintaining the normal development of rice microspores.
  Os, Oryza sativa. (b) Regulation of rice m6A methyltransferase‐like domain‐containing
  protein OsEDM2L on anther development. OsEDM2L‐mediated m6A installation facilitates
  the proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation of the OsEAT1 mRNA that encodes
  a positive regulator of tapetal programmed cell death during the anther development.
  Moreover, OsEDM2L could directly activate the OsEAT1 transcription by interacting
  with the transcription factors bHLH142 and TDR. (c) Regulation of tomato m6A demethylase
  SlALKBH2 on fruit ripening. SlALKBH2‐mediated m6A removal promotes mRNA stability
  of DNA demethylase gene SlDML2, a key ripening‐promoting gene, thereby facilitating
  fruit ripening. SlDML2 in turn acts on SlALKBH2 to activate its transcription by
  DNA demethylation, representing an interplay between m6A RNA methylation and DNA
  methylation during tomato fruit ripening. Sl, Solanum lycopersicum. (d) Regulation
  of strawberry m6A methyltransferase FvMTA on fruit ripening. FvMTA‐mediated m6A
  installation promotes mRNA stability or translation efficiency of key genes in ABA
  pathway including FvNCED5, FvAREB1 and FvABAR, thereby facilitating fruit ripening.
  Fv, Fvesca vesca. (e) Regulation of apple m6A reader MhYTP2 on leaf resistance to
  powdery mildew. MhYTP2‐mediated m6A recognition elevates the mRNA stability of MdMLO19,
  a positive regulator in powdery mildew resistance, and the translation efficiency
  of antioxidant genes, thereby enhancing the resistance of apple leaves to powdery
  mildew. Mh, Malus hupehensis; Md, Malus domestica. (f) Regulation of human m6A demethylase
  FTO on rice root growth and tiller formation. Heterologous expression of human FTO
  in rice promotes root growth and tiller formation by regulating the expression of
  genes in various metabolic pathways, therefore facilitating rice yield and biomass.
