figure_title: Computational workflow to determine the target protein from metabolites
  obtained from metabolomics.
caption: Computational workflow to determine the target protein from metabolites obtained
  from metabolomics. The metabolites undergo an intricate computational workflow pipeline
  aimed at identifying protein targets and elucidating their functional pathways.
  The identified target proteins and associated metabolites are then subjected to
  in silico methods such as molecular dynamic simulations and require further experimental
  validation
