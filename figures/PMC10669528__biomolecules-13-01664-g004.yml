figure_title: The process of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of systemic onfection.
caption: The process of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of systemic onfection. SARS-CoV-2
  can overactivate NLRP3 through the binding of the spike protein and ACE2 while also
  causing the activation of the adrenaline–angiotensin–aldosterone system and complement
  cascade. SARS-CoV-2 can also activate MAC through the MBL-MASP-2 pathway, leading
  to the binding of NLRP3 and ultimately activating GSDMD. Activated GSDMD and caspase-11
  have also been found in neutrophil extracellular traps, activating the DIC cascade
  reaction through the activation of tissue factor and phosphatidic acid
