figure_title: Anti-inflammatory activity of the HPCH/TA hydrogel may occur through
  inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
caption: Anti-inflammatory activity of the HPCH/TA hydrogel may occur through inhibition
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) Volcano map showing differential genes (yellow
  plots represent differentially upregulated genes; blue plots are for differentially
  downregulated genes; gray plots represent the genes with no difference). (B) KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis in DEGs. The red box showed a significant enrichment
  in pathways associated with the NF-κB pathway. (C) Expression of p65 and p-p65 was
  analyzed by Western blot. (D) The density of bands was analyzed using ImageJ software,
  and statistical analysis was performed to determine the ratio of p-p65 to total
  p65. (E) Immunofluorescence imaging of p65 in ihDPCs treated with LPS after three
  hours. The cells were stained with anti-p65 antibody (appearing in green) and counterstained
  with DAPI to identify cell nuclei (appearing in blue). ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001
