figure_title: ZIKV activates ATF3 through the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway.
caption: ZIKV activates ATF3 through the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway.
  (A) Schematic of the ISR pathway. Stress conditions like virus infections, ER stress,
  amino acid deprivation and oxidative stress induce stalling of cap-dependent translation
  by phosphorylating eIF2α and inducing the translation of ATF4. ATF4 in turn activates
  downstream targets including ATF3 to restore cellular homeostasis. A549 WT cells
  were mock-infected or infected with the ZIKVPR (moi=10 PFU/cell) in the presence
  or absence of ISRIB, an ISR inhibitor. Cells were harvested 24-hours post-infection,
  and (B) cellular and viral proteins analyzed by western blot. The fold change (2−ΔΔCt)
  in (C) ATF4, (D) ASNS, (E) ATF3 and (F) ZIKV mRNA levels relative to ACTB mRNA were
  determined by RT-qPCR from three technical replicates and three biological replicates.
  (G) Viral titers in cell culture media were measured by plaque assay. Average viral
  titers were calculated from three independent experiments with the paque assay being
  performed in duplicate. (H) A549 WT cells received no treatment or were incubated
  with DMSO (control) or ISRIB. Arbitrary luciferase unit were measured as a proxy
  for cell viability. (I) A549 cells were either mock-infected or infected with ZIKVPR
  (moi=10 PFU/cell) in the presence or absence of ISRIB. Cellular and nuclear fractions
  were prepared from cells harvested 24-hours post-infection. The resultant subcellular
  fractions were analyzed by Western blotting and probed with anti-NS1, ATF4, ATF3,
  fibrillarin and α-tubulin antibodies. Fibrillarin and α-tubulin were used as nuclear
  and cytoplasmic markers respectively. The western bots shown are representative
  of three independent experiments. The quantitative data are shown as the means ±
  SD. The experiment was repeated three times. Statistical significance was determined
  by Student T-test. **p<0.05, ***p<0.0005, ****p<0.0001, ns-not significant. (18,
