caption: Bubble plots demonstrating enriched KEGG pathways for the five miRNAs in
  leukemia and in lymphoma. Y-axis represents the pathways that were associated with
  the miRNAs’ target genes, and the X-axis represents the fold enrichment score for
  each term. The bigger the size of the dot, the greater the degree of pathway enrichment.
  The red color indicates a lower chance of error, so higher confidence in the results.
  (A) miR-1 in leukemia significantly impacts the cell cycle, among other pathways.
  (B) miR-196a-5p in leukemia majorly impacts the RAS signaling pathway, among others.
  (C) miR-20a-5p in lymphoma significantly impacts the TGF–β signaling pathway, among
  others. (D) miR-23a-3p in lymphoma significantly impacts the TNF signaling pathway,
  among others. (E) miR-92b-3p in lymphoma significantly impacts the RNA degradation
  and apoptosis pathways, among others
