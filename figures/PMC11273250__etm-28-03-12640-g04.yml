caption: In HUVECs treated with NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, the expression of VE-cadherin
  fails to increase with NTN4 overexpression. (A) PDTC (an NF-κB signaling pathway
  inhibitor)-treated HUVECs and control HUVECs were cultured. Western blot assay depicting
  the protein levels of NF-κB and VE-cadherin. (B) Relative protein levels of NF-κB
  in HUVECs treated with PDTC. β-actin was used as the loading control (n=4). (C)
  Relative protein levels of VE-cadherin in HUVECs treated with PDTC. β-actin was
  used as the loading control (n=4). (D) HUVECs transfected with NTN4-overexpression
  or control plasmids were cultured with PDTC. Western blot assay depicting the protein
  levels of NTN4 and VE-cadherin. (E) Relative protein levels of NTN4 in HUVECs with
  NTN4 overexpression following treatment with PDTC. β-actin was used as the loading
  control (n=4). (F) Relative protein levels of VE-cadherin in HUVECs with NTN4 overexpression
  following treatment with PDTC by western blotting. β-actin was used as the loading
  control (n=4). **P<0.01; ***P<0.001. n.s., not significant; Con, control; NTN4,
  Netrin-4; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate;
  VE, vascular endothelial; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide
