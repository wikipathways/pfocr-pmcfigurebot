caption: (a) Methods of drug delivery to the skin using microneedles (MNs). Microneedles
  are first applied to the skin (i) and then used for drug delivery (ii). Solid microneedles
  are used as a pretreatment, after which the drug can diffuse through residual holes
  in skin from a topical formulation (solid MNs). After insertion of drug-coated microneedles
  into the skin, the drug coating dissolves off the microneedles in the aqueous environment
  of the skin (coated MNs). Drug-loaded microneedles are made of water-soluble or
  biodegradable materials encapsulating the drug that is released in the skin upon
  microneedle dissolution (dissolving MN). Hollow microneedles are used to inject
  liquid formulations into the skin (hollow MNs). Reproduced with permission [173].
