figure_title: Aging induces rhythmic expression of autophagy and mTOR pathways in
  astrocytes
caption: A. Schematic of mouse lines and lighting schedule for aging experiment. B.
  Heatmaps showing transcripts that were rhythmic in astrocytes from young WT mice
  (upper) and rhythmic in aged mice (lower). In both rows of heatmaps, the genes plotted
  are in the same order to compare differences in rhythmic expression between mice.
  C. KEGG pathway analysis of astrocyte transcripts identified as rhythmic (by RAIN
  analysis) in aged mice. D. Heatmaps showing temporally-coordinated expression of
  KEGG endocytic pathway genes only in astrocytes from aged mice. E-G. Graphs showing
  circadian expression patterns of astrocyte transcripts from young WT (green), APP/PS1
  (purple), or aged (brown) mice. E. Core clock genes Per2 and Arntl (Bmal1) remain
  rhythmic but are induced in aged astrocytes. F,G. Autophagy genes Atg10, Pdpk1,
  and Ulk1 (F), as well as Mtor (G) are induced and gain rhythmicity in aged astrocytes.
  Adjusted P values from RAIN are shown. Each datapoint is the average of two mice,
  each from separate experiments
