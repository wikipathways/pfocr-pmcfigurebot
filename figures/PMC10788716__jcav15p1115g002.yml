figure_title: Knockdown of GDF15 greatly suppressed PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in
  both M14 and M21 cell lines.
caption: Knockdown of GDF15 greatly suppressed PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in both
  M14 and M21 cell lines. (A) Knockdown vectors of GDF15 were constructed in both
  M21 and M14 cell lines (n=3); (B) The inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by
  sh-GDF15 was reversed by 740Y-P in M14 cell line (n=3); (C) The inhibition of PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway by sh-GDF15 was reversed by 740Y-P in M21 cell line (n=3). * indicates
  p<0.05. T-test and ANOVA tests were applied in this research for statistical analysis
