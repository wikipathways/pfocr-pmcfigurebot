caption: The overlap analysis of the differently expressed genes (DEGs) responding
  to drought and high-temperature stresses. (A) Venn diagram analysis shows that 880
  DEGs respond to both drought and high-temperature stresses. (B) The heat map shows
  the DEGs that are downregulated and/or upregulated by drought or high temperature
  among these 880 DEGs. The clusters in the same group with a similar or an opposite
  expression trend in D_48h vs. D_0h, and H_9h vs. H_0h comparisons were decorated
  with the same colour asterisk. The enriched gene ontology (GO) terms (C) and The
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichments (D) for these 880 DEGs.
  The number of genes in each pathway is equal to the size of the dot. The dot color
  represents the p-value
