caption: Prostate cancer pathways [112]. This is a schematic presentation of PC pathogenesis,
  driving factors, connections between genes, and signaling pathways. Key events in
  carcinogenesis include DNA hypermethylation, triggering the MARK signaling pathway,
  which leads to cell proliferation and tumor growth. Open questions are marked in
