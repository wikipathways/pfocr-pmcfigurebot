figure_title: Transcriptome profile of Srf-deficient astrocytes
caption: (A) Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes in control and Srf-deficient
  astrocytes from RNA sequencing. (B) Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway and Reactome pathway
  analysis of upregulated genes in Srf-deficient astrocytes. (C) Gene Ontology and
  KEGG pathway analysis of downregulated genes in Srf-deficient astrocytes. (D) Quantitative
  PCR analysis of interferon, inflammatory and defense response genes in reactive
  astrocytes identified in Gene Ontology analysis. n=3 mice. Data are represented
  as mean ± SEM. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.005, ****p<0.001, ns, not significant.
  Unpaired t-test. Figure 5—source data 1.Top 25 genes up- and downregulated in SrfGFAPCKO
  astrocytes.  Figure 5—source data 2.Top 25 genes up- and downregulated in SrfGFAP-ERCKO
  astrocytes.  Figure 5—source data 3.KEGG pathway analysis of Srf-deficient astrocytes.(A)
  Table showing KEGG pathway and genes upregulated in Srf-deficient astrocytes. (B)
  Table showing KEGG pathway and genes downregulated in Srf-deficient astrocytes.
  (C) Expression of genes involved in neurotoxicity of reactive astrocytes in Srf-deficient
  astrocytes. Genes with fold change of >2.0 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered
  significant. Dotted lines indicate cut-off fold change of 1.5.
