figure_title: Differential metabolite KEGG enrichment map.
caption: Differential metabolite KEGG enrichment map. The x-axis represents the Rich
  Factor corresponding to each channel. The y-axis displays the pathway names (arranged
  by p-value), with the dot color reflecting the magnitude of the p-value (redder
  indicates stronger enrichment). The size of the dots indicates the number of enriched
  differential metabolites
