caption: Expression profiling of key gene families in the reconstituted glycolysis
  and TCA cycle pathway. Eleven key metabolism-related gene families were identified,
  including HXK (hexokinase), G6PI (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), PFK (phosphofructokinase),
  GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase),
  PGM (phosphoglucomutase), ENO (enolase), PK (pyruvate kinase), DLAT (dihydrolipoyl
  dehydrogenase), IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase), and ACLY (ATP-citrate synthase)
