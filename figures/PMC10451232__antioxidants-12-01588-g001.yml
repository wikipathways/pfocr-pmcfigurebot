caption: Common gene expression signatures among three liver fibrosis models. (A)
  Schematic diagram illustrating our transcriptomic analyses conducted on models of
  liver fibrosis induced by DMN, BDL, and CCl4. (B) Venn diagrams depicting the overlaps
  of DEGs across the three liver fibrosis models. (C) Top ten pathways significantly
  enriched in DEGs that were commonly upregulated or downregulated across all three
  fibrosis models. DMN, dimethylnitrosamine; BDL, bile duct ligation; CCl4, carbon
  tetrachloride
