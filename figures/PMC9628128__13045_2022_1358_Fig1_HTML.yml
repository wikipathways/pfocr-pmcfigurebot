caption: A Aerobic glycolysis in cancer. The transportation of extracellular glucose
  to the cytoplasm is achieved by glucose transporters (GLUTs). Hexokinase (HK) catalyzes
  the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and the conversion of Glucose-6-phosphate
  to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) is a reversible reaction. The F6P can be catalyzed
  into fructose-1,6-biphosphate (F1,6BP) by phosphofructokinase1 (PFK-1). F1,6BP is
  converted into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) through a series of reversible reactions.
  Pyruvate kinase (PK) was responsible for catalyzing PEP into pyruvate and pyruvate
  can reversibly transformed to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Finally, lactate
  is transported out of cells which relies on the monocarboxylate transporter/MCT
  family. Carbonic anhydrases IX (CAIX) can export redundant protons and lactate and
  maintain the acid–base balance. In addition, the intermediates in glycolysis can
  enter other metabolic processes including hexosamine pathway, pentose phosphate
  pathway, lipid metabolism, TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism and one-carbon metabolism
  to synthesize biomacromolecules and meet the urgent growth needs of tumors. Arrows
  indicate positive modulations or transitions, while blunt ends indicate negative
  modulations. B The genetic phenotype in CRC regulates glycolysis. Mutations in APC
  lead to β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activation which induces increased transcription
  of β-catenin target genes to increase glycolysis. Inactivating mutations or deletion
  in the TP53 gene inhibits HIF1A, MYC, GLUTs, HK2, F2,6BP and MCT1 to reduce glycolysis.
  p53-induced upregulation of parkin can accelerate the degradation of HIF1. Activating
  mutations in RAS and the overexpression of EGFR trigger the activation of downstream
  pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 axis to promote glycolysis by enhancing glucose
  uptake, phosphorylating glycolytic enzymes and transcriptionally regulating glucose
  transporters and glycolytic enzymes expression via transcription factors such as
  HIF1A and MYC. Arrows indicate positive modulations or transitions, while blunt
  ends indicate negative modulations
