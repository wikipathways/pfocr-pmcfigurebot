  (p < 0.
caption: '(A) Bubble diagram of significant enrichment pathway of BP and NP groups
  (p < 0.05). The vertical ordinate denotes metabolic pathway, and the horizontal
  ordinate denotes rich factor (number of significantly differential metabolites/number
  of total metabolites in the pathway). The size of bubbles represents the number
  of metabolites in the pathway. The bubble color from red to green corresponds to
  the p-valueâ€™s increase. (B) The top 10 differential metabolites in top 5 enrichment
  pathways. FC (fold change): the ratio of the average expression of metabolites in
  the BP and the NP groups. log2(FC): the logarithm of the ratio of the average metabolite
  content in the BP group (red) to the NP group (yellow). The values above asterisks
  represent the multiple of difference between the two groups. Significance differences
  are indicated by * (p < 0.05), *** (p < 0.001), and **** (p < 0.0001)'
