caption: Schematic for aging, APOE-ε4 genotype, T2DM, HTN, and inflammation/neuroinflammation
  in the development of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). Note that each of the major color-coded
  components AGING yellow, APOE-ε4 (blue), Hypertension (orange), Inflammation/Neuroinflammation
  (red), and their respective components may all contribute to the development and
  evolution of the centrally located CMBs. Also, note the importance of BECact/dys
  and BBBdd as a possible final common pathway for the development of CMBs. Note that
  ROS and MMPs are placed in a colored dark-red box with yellow lettering since they
  are possibly the final common signaling pathway for the development of CMBs due
  to the degradation of the glia limitans of the perivascular units’ perivascular
  spaces outermost limiting barrier membrane and the rupture of arterioles in CAA.
  APOE-ε4, apolipoprotein epsilon 4; BBB, blood–brain barrier; BBBdd, blood–brain
  barrier dysfunction and/or disruption; BECact/dys, brain endothelial cell activation
  and dysfunction; CAA, cerebral amyloid angiopathy; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases;
  NO, nitric oxide; PKC, protein kinase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species, upward arrow,
  increase; downward arrow, decrease
