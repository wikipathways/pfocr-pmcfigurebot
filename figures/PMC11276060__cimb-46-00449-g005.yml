figure_title: LncRNA TCONS_00211357, which is predicted to target several NF-κB pathway-related
  genes such as TRIM38 (NF-κB activator) and NFKBID (NF-κB inhibitor), may act as
  a key regulator of the NF-κB pathway in immune response to E.
caption: 'LncRNA TCONS_00211357, which is predicted to target several NF-κB pathway-related
  genes such as TRIM38 (NF-κB activator) and NFKBID (NF-κB inhibitor), may act as
  a key regulator of the NF-κB pathway in immune response to E. coli F17 infection.
  Targeting signaling pathways of E. coli and S. aureus maternal genes have similar
  functions and provide a basis for screening effective therapeutic agents through
  lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions networks. The detection of serum lncRNA n335659 may
  have potential for monitoring the effect of tuberculosis treatment. LncRNA SNHG3
  may regulate the expression of PKM2 through binding to miR-139-5P competitively,
  and thus regulate CRPC development and enzalutamide resistance. E. coli: Escherichia
  coli; S. aureus: Staphylococcus aureus; ceRNAs: competitive endogenous RNAs; lncRNA:
  long non-coding RNA; miRNA: microRNA; M. tuberculosis: Mycobacterium tuberculosis;
  DS-TB: drug-sensitive tuberculosis; MDR-TB: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; PKM2:
  pyruvate kinase isozyme typeM2; CRPC: castration-resistant prostate cancer'
