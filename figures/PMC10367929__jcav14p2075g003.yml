caption: pt-PDB causes apoptosis and S-phase arrest in order to inhibit cell proliferation.
  (A) Using annexin V and propidium iodide labeling, flow cytometric examination of
  apoptotic cells was carried out. Late apoptotic cell populations are represented
  by red squares. **P < 0.01, student's t-test. Means ± S.D., n = 3. (B) Effect of
  pt-PDB on the level of protein expression in the apoptotic pathway. Caspase 9 and
  Caspase 8 in their cleaved form. (C) Using PI labeling, flow cytometric examination
  of cell cycle was carried out. **P < 0.01, student's t-test. Means ± S.D., n = 3.
  (D) Effect of pt-PDB on the level of protein expression in the cell cycle pathway.
  p21Cip1 (p21), phospho-Rb, phospho-ERK, and phospho-MEK
