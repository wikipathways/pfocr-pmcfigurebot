  cardiac autophagy status of ZDF-F rats.
caption: 'Effect of treatment with NP-6A4 or co-treatment with PD123319 on the cardiac
  autophagy status of ZDF-F rats. (A) New autophagy signaling pathway consisting of
  8 proteins activated in response to NP-6A4 in ZDF-F rat heart as predicted by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis of the differentially expressed proteins between saline and NP-6A4
  treated rat hearts (orange color indicates activation: see Prediction legend) in
  the Diseases and Functions category. The fold change of each protein in NP-6A4-treated
  rat hearts compared to those treated with saline (top number below each protein)
  and p value (bottom number below each protein) are shown. Z score = 1.664; p value
  = 0.005. (B) Representative images of immunoblotting analysis of cardiac lysates
  from ZDF-F rats treated with saline, NP-6A4, or NP-6A4 + PD123319 and probed with
  anti-LC3, anti-Rubicon, anti-p62, and anti-Actin antibodies are shown. An increase
  in LC3-I and LC3-II levels and a reduction in Rubicon and p62 levels is seen in
  ZDF-F rat heart lysates treated with NP-6A4 compared to those treated with saline
  or NP-6A4 + PD123319. Graphs show quantification of LC3-II (C), Rubicon (D), and
  p62 (E) in ZDF-F rat heart lysates after normalization to Actin. NP-6A4 significantly
  increased LC3-II, but suppressed Rubicon and p62. (F) Representative images of immunohistochemistry
  of cardiac tissues from ZDF-F rats treated with saline, NP-6A4, or NP-6A4 + PD123319
  and immunostained with (1) anti-LC3 antibodies (green) to visualize autophagic vesicles,
  (2) wheat germ agglutinin (red) to define boundaries of cardiomyocytes and (3) DAPI
  (blue) to visualize the nucleus. Zoomed-in highlights are shown in the row below.
  The scale bar (30 Âµm) is marked as a white line. Cardiomyocyte boundaries are well
  defined in the heart tissues of NP-6A4-treated rats compared to those treated with
  saline, but co-treatment with PD123319 made cardiomyocyte boundaries even more diffused.
  (G) Autophagic dot numbers significantly increased in rat hearts treated with NP-6A4,
  and this was attenuated by co-treatment with PD123319. The increase in LC3-II seen
  in panel C correlates with the increase in autophagosome puncta seen in E and F
  indicating induction of autophagy in NP-6A4-treated ZDF-F rat hearts. ** p < 0.01;
  **** p < 0.0001; ns: not significant'
