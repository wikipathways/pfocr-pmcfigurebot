figure_title: Inhibiting PUFA metabolism suppresses ferroptosis in lipid-starved cancer
  cells
caption: 'A, Schematic illustrating the PUFA metabolism pathway and inhibitors of
  FADS1 and FADS2. FADS2, fatty acid desaturase 2; ELOVL2/5, elongase of very-long
  fatty acid 2/5; FADS1, fatty acid desaturase 1. B, Fold change in gene expression
  of FADS1, FADS2, and ELOVL2 in the indicated cells cultured in lipid-depleted versus
  lipid-replete media for 24 h. C, Fold change in the relative ratios of highly unsaturated
  PUFAs to their precursor PUFAs in the indicated cells cultured in lipid-depleted
  versus lipid-replete media for 24 h. D-H, Cell death of A549 (D), HeLa (E), Panc1
  (F), H1299 (G), and MIA PaCa-2 (H) cells treated with 1 μM RSL3 for 24 h after initial
  pre-treatment of cells in lipid-depleted versus lipid-replete media, with or without
  5 μM SC26196 or 10 μM CP24879, for 24 h. I, J, Cells were pulse labeled with [U-13C]-18:2(n-6),
  followed by a chase period prior to lipid extraction and analysis, as shown in Fig.
  3A. Relative levels of [M+18] labeled PUFAs in the non-polar (I) or polar (J) lipid
  fractions from A549 cells post-pulse and after the chase period into lipid-replete
  media or lipid-depleted media, with or without 10 μM CP24879. K, Sequencing confirmation
  of FADS2 gene editing by CRISPR-Cas9 in A549 cells. Indel sequences and allele frequencies
  taken from analysis using CRISPResso240. L, Cell death of A549 sgNTC cells versus
  sgFADS2 #1.1 cells treated with the indicated concentrations of RSL3 for 24 h after
  initial pre-treatment of cells in lipid-depleted media for 24 h. M, Cell death of
  A549 sgNTC versus sgFADS2 #1.1 cells treated with the indicated concentrations of
  RSL3 for 24 h after initial pre-treatment of cells in lipid-depleted media containing
  bovine serum albumin (BSA) control or 25 μM BSA-conjugated 20:4(n-6) for 24 h. Data
  are presented as mean ± s.e.m; n = 3 biologically independent replicates. Comparisons
  were made using two-way ANOVA (D-J, L-N). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001'
