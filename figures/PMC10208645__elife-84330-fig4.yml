figure_title: Aac2pA128P accumulates along the carrier import pathway and induces
  protein import stress
caption: (A) Growth of cells after serial dilution showing that aac2A128P-HIS6 is
  toxic at 25°C on glucose medium in an M2915-6A-derived strain. (B) Schematic of
  our approach to identify aberrant protein-protein interactions of Aac2pA128P-HIS6.
  (C) Co-purified proteins significantly enriched in Aac2pA128P-HIS6 eluate compared
  with Aac2p-HIS6. See Materials and methods for details on abundance value calculation.
  FDR-corrected p-values depicted are from multiple t test analysis. Lower panel is
  a schematic of the mitochondrial carrier protein import pathway. (D) Absolute quantities
  of Aac2p and Tim22p in Aac2p-HIS6 and Aac2pA128P-HIS6 eluates, as determined by
  parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry. p-Value was calculated with
  Student’s t test. (E–F) Tetrad analysis demonstrating lethality of aac2A128P expression
  with genetic defects in carrier protein import in the M2915-6A strain background.
  Cell were grown on YPD at 30°C. Data depicted as mean ± SEM. Figure 4—source data
  1.Proteins that preferentially interact with Aac2pA128P-HIS6, compare with Aac2-HIS6
  in low-salt conditions.
