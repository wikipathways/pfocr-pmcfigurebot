caption: 'Potential schematic overview of the B7-H4-mediated signalling pathway in
  trophoblast cells in patients with early-onset PE. sB7-H4 diminishes trophoblast
  cell proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis. The introduction of
  IL-6, an activator of the PI3K/Akt/STAT3 pathway, reverses sB7-H4’s inhibitory effects
  on trophoblast cells. These findings illuminate sB7-H4’s role in regulating trophoblast
  cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt/STAT3 pathway in PE.
