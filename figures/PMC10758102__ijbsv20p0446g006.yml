  pathway.
caption: The VEGFA/NRP-1/GAPVD1 axis targeted the downstream Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. (A) Western blotting analysis of β-catenin and Wnt/β-catenin downstream
  targets in TNBC cells after treatment with 10 ng/ml hVEGF165. (B) Western blotting
  analysis of β-catenin and Wnt/β-catenin downstream targets in TNBC cells after VEGFA
  knockdown (shVEGFA). (C) Western blotting analysis of β-catenin and Wnt/β-catenin
  downstream targets in TNBC cells after NRP-1 knockdown (shNRP-1) in the presence
  or absence of 10 ng/ml hVEGF165. (D) Western blotting analysis of β-catenin and
  Wnt/β-catenin downstream targets in TNBC cells after GAPVD1 knockdown (shGAPVD1#2
  and shGAPVD1#3). (E) Western blotting analysis of β-catenin and Wnt/β-catenin downstream
  targets in control and NRP-1-silencing TNBC cells after GAPVD1 overexpression (OE
  GAPVD1). The images show representative data, and data are expressed as the mean
  ± SD of each group of cells from three separate experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ****P < 0.0001 vs. the controls
