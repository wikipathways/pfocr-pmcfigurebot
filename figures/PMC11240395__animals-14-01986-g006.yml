  after injecting the dsTOR in Litopenaeus vannamei.
caption: The expression of the genes related to the mTOR1 pathway, vg, and vgr after
  injecting the dsTOR in Litopenaeus vannamei. (A) The expression of genes related
  to the mTOR1 pathway and vg in hepatopancreas; (B) the expression of the genes related
  to the mTOR1 pathway, vg, and vgr in ovary. Data with different superscripts significantly
  differed based on the independent samples Studentâ€™s t-test (p < 0.05). * means that
  the regression model was extremely and significantly suitable (p < 0.05), ** means
  that the regression model was extremely and significantly suitable (p < 0.01), ***
  means that the regression model was extremely and significantly suitable (p < 0.001),
  while ns means that the regression model was not suitable (p > 0.05). Data are reported
  as the means and SE of 3 replicates
