caption: Physiological Mechanisms Induced by Cryopreservation. Cold overfeeding leads
  to cellular damage, prompting the thermogenesis process to generate heat. This process
  activates downstream pathways, such as “Oxidative phosphorylation” and “MAPK signaling
  pathway,” which are essential for ATP production and cellular functions. Consequently,
  the cryopreservation and warming process necessitates increased ATP production to
  sustain cell survival and proliferation. The KEGG database indicates associations
  between pathway enrichment results, represented as rectangles, and downstream mechanism
  predictions, depicted as ovals. Hexagons denote vital compounds
