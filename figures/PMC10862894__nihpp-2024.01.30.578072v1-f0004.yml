figure_title: Casein kinase 1 regulates TORC2 signaling pathway
caption: (A) Wildtype and yck1Δ yck2-as1 were grown to early log phase at 25°C and
  0.5 μM of 3-MOB-PP1 was the added to both strains and samples were collected at
  the indicated time points. Ypk-pT662 and Ypk1 were analyzed by western blot. Quantification
  of the Ypk-pT662 signal over total Ypk1 protein is shown. Error bars represent the
  SD of the mean of three biological replicates. (B) Wildtype and yck1Δ yck2-as1 cells
  were grown to early log phase at 25°C and 0.5 μM of 3-MOB-PP1 was then added to
  both strains for 15 minutes and cultures were then shifted from YPD to YPG/E medium
  containing the same amount of inhibitor. After 2 hours in YPG/E medium cells were
  shifted back to YPD medium (indicated by red arrows). Samples were collected at
  the indicated time points and Ypk-pT662 and Ypk1 were analyzed by Western blotting.
  (C) Wildtype and yck1Δ yck2-as1 were grown to early log phase at 25°C and 0.5 μM
  of 3-MOB-PP1 was then added to both strains and samples were collected at the indicated
  time points. Fpk1 phosphorylation was assayed by western blot. (D) Kinase reactions
  containing affinity purified Yck1–8xHIS and Gal-3xHA-Ypk1 in the indicated combinations
  were initiated by addition of ATP and performed for 30 minutes. Ypk1 and Yck1 phosphorylation
  was assayed by western blot
