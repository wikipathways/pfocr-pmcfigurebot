  Cana suppresses the induction of iNOS and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in HG-treated BV-2 cells but augments the expression of COX-2. (a,b) NG-cultured cells, with or without the four SGLT2 inhibitors (10 and 20 μM) given 30 min in advance, were stimulated with HG (50 mM) for 24 h. Cultures treated with HG served as the control group. The iNOS and COX-2 levels were analyzed using Western blotting. The relatively densitometric analysis results were shown using histograms, and values are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 4). #
  p < 0.05 vs. HG group’s iNOS; &
  p < 0.05 vs. HG group’s COX-2. (c) NG-cultured cells, with or without specific signaling pathway inhibitors (20 μM PD98059 (PD), 10 μM SP600125 (SP), 15 μM SB203580 (SB), 10 μM LY294002 (LY), and 3 μM CAPE) given 30 min in advance were exposed to 50 mM HG for 24 h. After Western blotting detection, the relatively densitometric analysis results of iNOS and COX-2 levels were shown using histograms, and values are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 4). #
  p < 0.05 vs. HG group’s iNOS; &
  p < 0.05 vs. HG group’s COX-2. (d,e) The same treatments as (a,b) were administered, and the cultures were incubated only for 12 h. The secretion levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were assayed using ELISA. Results were shown using histograms and values are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 4, in triplicate). #
