figure_title: PFG blocks the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via MUC1 suppression.
caption: 'PFG blocks the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via MUC1 suppression. Expression
  levels of key proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway and their downstream target
  proteins were measured in cells with MUC1 (A) knockdown and (B) OE by western blotting.
  PFG was applied to the cells for 24 h. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n=3)
  and the data were normalized to the sh-control or the OE-control group treated with
  0 μM PFG. Two-way ANOVA was applied to establish statistical significance. #P<0.05,
  ##P<0.01 vs. control group (0 μM PFG); *P<0.05, **P<0.01. MUC1, mucin 1; OE, overexpression;
  PFG, paeoniflorigenone; sh, short hairpin'
