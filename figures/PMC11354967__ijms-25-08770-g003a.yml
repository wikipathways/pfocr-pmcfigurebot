caption: 'IS activated the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway. (A)
  Immunofluorescence staining of AhR in IS-treated (for 1 h) D1 cells. Scale bar =
  150 µm; magnification = 20×. The nuclei were stained blue through DAPI staining.
  (B) Effect of IS on the translocation of AhR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in
  D1 cells. Cells were treated with a vehicle control, IS, or benzo[a]pyrene (BaP;
  an AhR agonist serving as the positive control) for 2 and 4 h. Total nuclear and
  cytosolic fractions were isolated and AhR levels were measured through Western blotting.
  GAPDH and histone-H3 were used as marker proteins for nonnuclear and nuclear fractions,
  respectively. The lower panel depicts the quantitation of nuclear AhR from Western
  blotting. (C,D) mRNA levels (measured through quantitative real-time polymerase
  chain reaction [qRT-PCR]) for cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1)
  and cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1 (CYP1B1) in D1 cells were compared
  among control, BaP-treated, and IS-treated cells subjected or not subjected to AhR
  antagonist (CH-223191; 10 μM) treatment (C) or Ahr silencing (KD) (D). Data are
  presented as mean ± standard deviation values (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001; * compared with the control. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001; # compared
  with the IS-treated group; analysis of variance)'
