caption: BMP8B triggers NF-κB signaling to suppress adipogenesis. (A) The upregulated
  KEGG pathway in LV-Bmp8b vs LV-ZsGreen1. (B,C) Western blots and quantification
  of p-IKKα/β and p-p65 in Mock, LV-ZsGreen1, and LV-Bmp8b. (D,E) Representative photographs
  of Oil Red O staining were taken to visualize lipids in LV-Bmp8b exposed to JSH-23
  with DMSO as a vehicle. The staining intensity was quantified by measuring the optical
  density at OD492. Scale bar = 20 µm. The symbols in the charts represent three biological
  replicates. Mean ± SD was used to present the data, which were analyzed using one-way
  ANOVA (** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001)
