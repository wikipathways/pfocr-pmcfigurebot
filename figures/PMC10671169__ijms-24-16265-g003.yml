caption: Anti-inflammatory effect of NXC736. (A) Cell viability of L132 and A549 cells
  treated with NXC736 for 48 h. (B) Clonogenic cell survival curves obtained with
  colony formation assay (CFA). (C) The expression of NLRP3 in irradiated L132 cells
  using western blot. (D) The signaling pathway of NF-κB inflammation confirmed using
  western blot in L132 cells after 6 Gy IR. (E) The changes in mRNA expression of
  inflammation-related cytokines due to NXC736 measured with qRT-PCR in L132 cells
  after 6 Gy IR. A statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of
  variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. All experiments
  were performed in triplicate. Tukey’s test was utilized to assess significant differences
  between individual groups. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (* p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 and n = 3)
