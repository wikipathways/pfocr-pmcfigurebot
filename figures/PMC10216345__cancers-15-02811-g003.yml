caption: Differentially expressed genes in mPSC treated with proglumide, CCK, or the
  combination of CCK and proglumide. (A) Proglumide decreases the expression of Ephb2
  in CCK-stimulated mPSC. Ephrin type-B receptor 2 is a gene that codes for a tyrosine
  kinase receptor implicated in tissue fibrosis. (B) Rictor/mTORC2 signaling mediates
  TGFβ1-induced fibroblast activation. Proglumide therapy downregulates CCK-activated
  Rictor expression. (C) The inflammatory cytokine IL-8 mRNA expression is significantly
  downregulated by the combination of CCK and proglumide. (D) Proglumide significantly
  downregulates the expression of CCK-stimulated Gli3, a transcriptional regulator
  of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway involved in tissue fibrosis. (E) Proglumide
  monotherapy does not significantly downregulate Acta2 expression, the gene responsible
  for alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA). (F) Proglumide decreases the expression of
  CCK-stimulated and unstimulated Col1α1 (which codes for collagen type 1α chain 1),
  a major component of the pancreatic cancer tumor microenvironment. Prog = proglumide;
  Combo = combination therapy with proglumide and CCK. N.S. = not significant. Significant
