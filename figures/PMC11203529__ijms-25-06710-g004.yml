figure_title: Screening of genes related to lignin synthesis pathway in stem.
caption: 'Screening of genes related to lignin synthesis pathway in stem. (A): Expression
  heatmaps of genes related to lignin biosynthesis pathway in different tissue types
  (Using the Euclidean distance measurement). (B): The regulatory relationship between
  TF and all corresponding lignin synthesis genes. (C): Gene expression patterns of
  lignin candidate genes. Data are presented as means ± SE (n = 3). Different letters
  above line graphs show a significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) among the two hybrids'
