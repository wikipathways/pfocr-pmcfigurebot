caption: 'Accumulation of pyrimidine synthesis precursors in PfRieske-iKD, while treatment
  with decyl-ubiquinone rescues its growth defect: (A) schematic image of the part
  of the pyrimidine synthesis pathways involving DHODH, ubiquinone, and PfCIII. The
  mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), inner membrane (IMM), ubiquinol (QH2),
  ubiquinone (Q), and decyl-ubiquinone (dQ) are shown. (B) Bar graph showing the levels
  of the analyzed pyrimidine synthesis pathway intermediates, N-cabamoyl-L-aspartate
  (left) and dihydroorotate (right), in the PfRieske-iKD line grown in the presence
  or absence of GlcN (Rieske/3D7 (±GlcN). Unpaired t-test was used with **** being
  <0.0001 and error bars are SD. (C) Growth curve of PfRieske-iKD in the presence
  and absence of GlcN (±GlcN) and of 30 µM dQ (±dQ). Errors bars are SEM'
