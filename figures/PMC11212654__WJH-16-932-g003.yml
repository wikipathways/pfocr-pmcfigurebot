caption: 'RNA-sequencing and bioinformatic analysis in Huh7 with LINC01767 over expression.
  A: Over expression of LINC01767 in Huh7 cells; B: The differential expression heatmap
  is presented in using the log fold change (FC) > 1.5, and P < 0.05; C: The differential
  expression volcano plot is presented in using the logFC > 1.5, and P < 0.05; D:
  The top 10 most significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms; E and F: Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis (GSEA) analysis showed that go term of LINC01767 involved in positive regulation
  of lymphocyte apoptosis, nucleotide kinase activity and so on; G: The top 10 most
  significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms; H and
  I: GSEA analysis showed KEGG pathway showed LINC01767 was involved in P53 signaling,
  RAP1 signaling and other important pathways; J: The top-ranked regulatory network
  in this regulatory effect analysis shows that the regulation net involved in regulators
  1810019D21Rik, E2f, TNFSF12 through C1QTNF12, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL9A3, CXCL2, CXCL8,
  JAG2, KCNH2, MTHFD1, NOTCH3, PPARGC1A, RRM2, S100A9, SLC2A4, SLC7A11, TP53; K: The
  updream regulatory network analysis shows the DSCAM and ATF5 and so on involved
  in the regulatory net; L: Molecular network showed it can interact with HSP90, LYZ,
  FUS, and so on.'
