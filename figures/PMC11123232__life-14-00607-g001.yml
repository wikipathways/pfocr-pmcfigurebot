caption: Diverse derivations of the prevailing paradigm for how life came into being
  on planet Earth. As discussed in the text, this paradigm holds that the presence
  of an ensemble of organic molecules is the necessary and sufficient condition for
  life to appear. When the first abiotic synthesis pathway for organics was discovered
  by Stanley Miller in the 1950s (left side of the figure), the question of life’s
  origin was considered fundamentally solved. In the meantime, a plethora of different
  ways to abiotically generate organics were found (only a few representatives of
  which are shown in this figure) and the detection of organic molecules in space
  even opened up the possibility that these “building blocks for life” may have been
  delivered from extraterrestrial sources. On the background of the mentioned paradigm,
  the debate presently mainly turns around the question of sorting out which specific
  pre-biotic synthesis pathway did indeed lead to life on Earth
