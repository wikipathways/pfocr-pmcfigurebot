caption: 'Illustration of semaphorin 6A–D signaling pathways and their interaction
  with the cellular molecular network in cancer cells. Activation of semaphorin signaling
  either via the “forward” (via plexins) or “reverse” mode by engaging RTK signaling
  is often associated with enhanced tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance
  to anticancer therapy. Pharmacological intervention (clofibrate, troglitazone, retinoic
  acid (RA)), molecular downregulation of SEMA6 activity (by dominant negative SEMA6A-1
  soluble extracellular domain, SEMA-ECD), downregulation of protein expression (miRNA),
  or even upregulation of SEMA6 expression (SEMA6C) may be beneficial as adjuvants
  along with anticancer therapeutics. VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR1/2:
  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1/2; Src: Src kinase; FAK: focal adhesion
  kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RhoA: transforming protein RhoA;
