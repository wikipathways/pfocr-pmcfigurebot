  Proposed potential mechanism of PRP instillation that promoted cell proliferation and angiogenesis through PI3K/AKT/m-TOR pathway contribution to the pathogenesis of OHD-induced OAB. (A,B): The levels of signaling related proteins in the bladder, including PI3K, AKT, m-TOR, e-NOS, RAS, ERK1/2, and SOX-9, were quantified by Western blots. In the OVX group, the expressions of PI3K, e-NOS and SOX-9 proteins were significantly declined, but the levels of AKT, m-TOR, RAS and ERK1/2 were significantly promoted as compared with the sham group. Additionally, the expressions of all the above proteins were obviously increased in the OVX + PRP group (except m-TOR, RAS and ERK1/2) as compared to the OVX group. Note: e-NOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; m-TOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SOX-9, SRY-box- 9. Data were expressed as means ± SD for n = 6, * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 versus the sham group; ††
  p < 0.01 versus the OVX group; #
  p < 0.05; ##
  p < 0.01 versus the OVX + PRP group
