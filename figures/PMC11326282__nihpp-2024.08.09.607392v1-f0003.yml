caption: ZCRB1 regulates ciliogenesis genes via splicing of minor intronsa. Volcano
  plot of DE MIG identified by RNA-seq analysis between heterozygous ZCRB1 knockout
  HEK Flp-in cells and WT cells. The red and blue dots denote significantly upregulated
  and downregulated genes, respectively, while the grey dots denote genes with no
  measure significant change. The horizontal dashed lines represent the cut off for
  significant fold change (≥ absolute log2 fold change of .58), while the horizontal
  line signifies the FDR significance cut-off (≤ 0.05).b. Barplot representative of
  the top FDR significant enriched biological processes (BP) identified involving
  DE MIGs in heterozygous ZCRB1 knockout cell lines versus WT. The length of bars
  is proportional to the FDR (adjusted p value) and the shading dictates the degree
  of linear fold change shown by the color bar. The diameter of the red dots on the
  end of the bars represents the number of genes present in each identified enriched
  pathway.c. Barplot representative of top DE primary cilia and centrosome associated
  MIGs. (FDR ≤ 0.05 and absolute linear fold change ≥ .1.5) as identified by RNA-seq
  analysis. Red and blue bars, upregulated and downregulated linear foldchanges, respectively.
  The color intensity denotes the degree of expression change. The FDR values for
  each expression level are displayed next to their respective bars.d. Immunofluorescence
  for centrioles (CEP-120) and PC (acetylated tubulin)e. Western blot analysis of
  primary cilia associated proteins following siRNA-mediated ZCRB1 knockdown in RPE-1
  cells. Protein expression of target genes is shown for WT and ZCRB1 siRNA targeted
  genes, respectively.f. Barplot showing quantification of primary cilia abundance.
