caption: 'Changes in renal function, inflammatory indexes, oxidative stress, and the
  regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in rats after establishing an
  acute kidney injury following traumatic brain injury model. (A) serum creatinine
  levels. (B) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels. (C) IL-1β content.
  (D) IL-6 content. (E) TNF-α content. (F) MDA content. (G) SOD activity. The results
  were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (bar chart). *: p < 0.05.'
