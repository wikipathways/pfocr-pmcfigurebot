  Knockdown of S100A4 inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway and reduced the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis-related proteins. (A,B) si-S100A4 downregulated the expression of p-NF-κB. The protein expression levels of p-NF-κB and NF-κB were analyzed using Western blot in the THP-1 macrophages pre-treated with si-S100A4 for 24 h and infected with BCG for 24 h subsequently. (C–E) The protein expression levels of p-NF-κB and NF-κB in the THP-1 macrophages, which were pre-treated with Triptolide (TPL) 5 nM for 2 h and infected with BCG for 24 h, were quantitatively analyzed using Western blot. (F,G) Inhibition of NF-κB decreased the expression of inflammatory-related proteins (NLRP3, Caspase-1 p48, ASC) and a pyroptosis-related protein (GSDMD-N). Data are from mean ± SD of three independent experiments, ns
  p > 0.05, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001
