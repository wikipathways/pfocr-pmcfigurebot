figure_title: Effect of fermented S.
caption: Effect of fermented S. fusiforme on the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) Western
  blot images using β-actin as an internal control showed the relative expression
  of the p65, p-p65, Iκ-B-α, and p-IκB-α proteins. (B,C) Bar graphs displaying the
  relative band intensity of each protein as measured by the NIH ImageJ program. The
  F + DSS group was the fermented S. fusiforme intervention group, the W + DSS group
  was the unfermented S. fusiforme intervention group, and the Y + DSS group was the
  positive drug intervention group. ** p <0.01, *** p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001
