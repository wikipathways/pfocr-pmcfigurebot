figure_title: NK cells at the late stage after CTT reversed MDSC immunosuppression
  and promoted MDSC maturation.
caption: NK cells at the late stage after CTT reversed MDSC immunosuppression and
  promoted MDSC maturation. (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) of the two sample
  groups. (B) Heat map of differentially expressed genes (n = 3 for each group). (C)
  Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in splenic MDSCs. (D) Scatter plot
  of downregulated GO signaling pathway in splenic MDSCs. (E) The mRNA levels of maturation
  markers, chemokines, stimulatory, and inflammatory cytokines genes in splenic MDSCs
  were analyzed by qRT-PCR (n = 4 for each group)
