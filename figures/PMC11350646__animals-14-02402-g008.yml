figure_title: Microbiological analysis of AHAS-H group and control group (n = 7).
caption: 'Microbiological analysis of AHAS-H group and control group (n = 7). Microbial
  composition profiles of two treatment groups at phylum (A) and genus (B) levels.
  (C) LDA effect size analysis (LEfSe). (D) Differential analysis of metabolic pathways:
  positive values of logFC on the horizontal axis represent up-regulation (log2 (fold
  change)) in group B relative to group A, while negative values indicate down-regulation.
  The vertical axis is labeled with different KEGG metabolic pathway names. The degree
  of significance is denoted by varying colors'
