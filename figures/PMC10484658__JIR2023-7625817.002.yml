caption: A schematic diagram of ERS in renal resident cells in LN. ER stress (ERS)
  is also involved in damage of renal resident cells in LN. The IRE1–XBP1 pathway
  plays an important protective role in maintaining the integrity of podocyte. ERS
  can activate the PERK–ATF4CHOP pathway to induce the podocytes apoptosis. ERS can
  induce the NF-κB inflammatory pathway by activating the PERK–ATF4CHOP pathway and
  promote the secretion of inflammatory factors in mesangial cells. ERS may promotes
  the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion
  molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and cytokine production in glomerular endothelial cells by activating
  the PERKATF4 pathway. ERS promotes apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs)
  by activating the PERK–CHOP signaling pathway. ERS promotes the production of a
  large amount of extracellular matrix (ECM) by fibroblasts through the activation
  of the ATF6TXNDC5 signaling pathway
