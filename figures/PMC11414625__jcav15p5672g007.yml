caption: Mast cells overexpressing CCL2 act on Mononuclear Phagocytes. (A) Bubble
  chart infers cell roles. (B) The heat map shows the differences in the number or
  intensity of interactions between different cell groups. (C) Heatmap showing the
  contribution of signaling pathways to mononuclear phagocyte subgroups in terms of
  outgoing or incoming signaling. Mononuclear phagocytes are affected by CCL signaling
