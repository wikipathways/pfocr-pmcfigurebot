figure_title: TBXT dose influences downstream gene expression in a dose-dependent
  manner
caption: (A) UMAP highlighting the mesoderm cluster (Cluster “9”) and (A’) Violin
  plot showing the relative expression levels of TBXT in each cluster. (B) Volcano
  plot of differentially expressed genes between WT and TBXT-Het or (B’) WT and TBXT-KO
  after subsetting the mesoderm cluster (n = 3,212 cells, adj. p < 0.05, log2FC >
  0.25) (C) Venn diagram of the number of DE genes identified in the TBXT-Het (green),
  TBXT-KO (Blue), or both TBXT-Het and TBXT-KO (purple) compared to WT. The top diagram
  includes genes downregulated in TBXT-Het and/or TBXT-KO compared to WT, while the
  bottom diagram includes genes upregulated in TBXT-Het and/or TBXT-KO compared to
  WT. (D) Dotplot of 89 DE genes between WT and TBXT-KO in order of log2FC. ‘*’ indicates
  genes that are also differentially expressed between WT to TBXT-Het, while the bolded
  black text indicates genes identified as likely direct targets of TBXT by comparison
  with ChIP-seq datasets. (E) Key results from ShinyGO GO Biological Process Analysis
  (FDR < 0.05, Pathway Size 2–2000 genes) (F) Multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization
  for MESP1, RSPO3, WNT5A, FGF17, and CYP26A1 in gastruloids at 48hr. In situ hybridizations
  were repeated for >=3 gastruloids of each genotype. (G-I) Dotplots showing gene
  expression trends for key genes related to mesoderm identity (G), WNT signaling
  (H), and EMT (I). (J) Venn diagrams summarizing DE genes detected in corresponding
  ChIP-seq datasets
