figure_title: A constitutively active cGAS-STING pathway limits SARS-CoV-2 replication
  in SCC25 cells
caption: '(A) SCC25 cells were transfected with 2 distinct siRNAs targeting the indicated
  genes or a non-targeting control (NT). 2d post-transfection, cells were infected
  with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 2 i.u./cell for 72 h. Data show the ratio of cell-associated
  viral RNA, as assessed by RT-qPCR, between knockdown (KD) and NT samples. Data display
  the mean of n=2 – 4 biological replicates, with error bars representing SEM. (B)
  Polyclonal populations of SCC25 cells knocked out (KO) for cGAS, STING, TBK1, and
  IRF3 using two separate sgRNAs or transduced with two individual non-targeting (NT)
  controls were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI: 2 i.u./cell for 72h. RT-qPCR analysis
  of cell-associated viral N RNA from 4–5 replicates is shown, where error bars show
  the SEM. ****p < 0.0001 significance was assessed by a one-way ANOVA and the Dunnett
  correction for multiple comparisons. (C) Immunoblots show SARS-CoV-2 N, cGAS, STING,
  TBK1, and IRF3 expression levels in SCC25 cells from panel B. β-actin serves as
  the loading control. (Representative of n=2). (D) Bulk populations of SCC25 STING
  KO cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2-mNeonGreen (NG) at a MOI:2 i.u./cell. NG-positive
  cells were enumerated by flow cytometry at 24, 48 and 72 hpi and represented as
  percentage of total population. Data show the mean of n=2 independent experiments,
  error bars denote the SEM.(E) SCC25 STING KO cells and NT control cells were pretreated
  with DMSO or 1 uM ruxolitinib for 24 hours and infected with SARS-CoV-2-mNG at a
  MOI:2 i.u./cell. NG-positive cells were enumerated by flow cytometry at 72 hpi and
  represented as percentage of total population. Data show the mean of n=4 independent
  experiments, error bars denote the SEM. **p< 0.01 where significance was assessed
  by 2-way ANOVA and Šidák multiple test correction'
