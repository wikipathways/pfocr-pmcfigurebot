figure_title: (A) MAPK signaling pathway containing T.
caption: (A) MAPK signaling pathway containing T. forsythia upregulated miRNAs in
  mandibles compared with sham-infected controls at p ≤ 0.05, adapted from the pathway
  express and using KEGG. Red boxes indicate 45 upregulated miRNA profiles from the
  NanoString analysis. Green boxes indicate no change in gene expression. An arrow
  indicates a molecular interaction resulting in classical MAP kinase pathway, phosphatidylinositol
  signaling system, JNK and p 38 MAP kinase pathway, p53 signaling pathway, ERK5 pathway,
  Wnt signaling pathway. A line without an arrowhead indicates a molecular interaction
  resulting in inhibition. Solid and dash-dotted lines denote direct and indirect
  relationships, respectively. +P indicates phosphorylation, and −P indicates dephosphorylation.
  The MAPK cascade is a highly conserved module that is involved in various cellular
  functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. (B) T cell
  receptor signaling pathway containing T. forsythia downregulated miRNAs in mandibles
  compared with sham-infected controls at p ≤ 0.05, adapted from the pathway express
  and using KEGG. Red boxes indicate 31 significantly downregulated miRNA profiles
  from the NanoString analysis. Green boxes indicate no change in gene expression.
  An arrow indicates a molecular interaction resulting in MAPK signaling pathway,
  calcium signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway,
  and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. A line without an arrowhead indicates a molecular
  interaction resulting in inhibition
