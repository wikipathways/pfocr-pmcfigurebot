figure_title: LFS-induced synaptic potentiation was induced through the CC pathway.
caption: LFS-induced synaptic potentiation was induced through the CC pathway. (a)
  Two different ways to cut the coronal slices. The brain slices were cut through
  the midline (left) and cut under the CC (right). (b,c) The average frequency of
  sEPSC from slices that were cut through the midline (b) or cut under the CC. (c).
  The LFS was applied 10 min after the baseline recording (shown in arrow). (d,e)
  The averaged amplitude of sEPSC from slices that were cut through the midline (d)
  or cut under the CC (e). (f,g) Summarized results of the frequency of sEPSC from
  slices that were cut through the midline (f) or cut under the CC (g). *** p < 0.001,
  one-way ANOVA. n.s. not significant
