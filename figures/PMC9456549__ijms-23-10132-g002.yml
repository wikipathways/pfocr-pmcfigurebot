caption: 'Pancreatic PI3K/AKT/mTOR: normal versus pathological. In a healthy cell,
  such as a pancreatic cell, different ligands (growth factors, hormones, cytokines,
  or chemokines) bind to tyrosine kinase (RTKs) or G-protein receptors (GPCRs) located
  in the cell membrane, leading to PI3K activation by phosphorylation. Further, PI3K
  catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at
  phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), leading to AKT activation. AKT
  activation consists of two phosphorylation processes, one performed by mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) at serine 473 residue and the second one
  at threonine 308 residue performed by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1).
  Phosphorylated AKT induces further activation of mTOR and tuberous sclerosis protein
  1 (TSC1) and TSC2 inhibition. In addition, mTOR phosphorylates ribosomal protein
  S6 kinases (S6K) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). The binding of growth factors
  to RTKs leads to Ras activation and in the end to extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) activation, correlated with cell proliferation. Altogether, ERK and
  AKT activation are conducive to cell growth, proliferation, protein synthesis, autophagy,
  and apoptosis. In pancreatic cancer cells, besides growth factors, hormones, and
  cytokines, KRAS mutations activate PI3K and Ras. Moreover, these types of cells
  are characterized by PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss. All these molecular events
  are associated with an overexpression of AKT phosphorylation, regarded as a pro-oncogenic
  factor. Together with ERK, AKT induces tumor growth, proliferation, migration, and
  invasion. “+”: activates, “−”: inhibits.'
