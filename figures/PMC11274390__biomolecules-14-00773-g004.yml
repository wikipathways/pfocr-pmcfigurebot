caption: Hypothetical schema of the molecular pathways of Cu-enhanced Zn-induced neurotoxicity.
  Under pathological conditions, such as transient global ischemia and excess Zn and
  Cu, are secreted into the synaptic cleft. Zn and Ca are then intracellularly translocated
  via Ca-A/K-R, NMDA-R, and L-VGCC. Elevated [Zn2+]i then triggers the ER stress pathway
  and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway,
  resulting in apoptotic neuronal death. Dantrolene, an inhibitor of the ER stress
  pathway, and SP600125, an inhibitor of the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway, attenuate
  Cu/Zn neurotoxicity. Zn also inhibits NAD+ and causes energy depletion in the mitochondria.
  Furthermore, Zn causes elevated [Ca2+]i, which then triggers various neurodegenerative
  processes. Substances that induce [Ca2+]i elevation (e.g., KCl) enhance Cu/Zn neurotoxicity,
  whereas substances that inhibit [Ca2+]i elevation (e.g., nimodipine, Al3+, and Gd3+)
  attenuate the neurotoxicity. It is also possible that Cu influences Zn-induced neurotoxicity
  because Cu produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which upregulate the ER stress
  and SAPK/JNK pathways. Thus, the presence of Cu exacerbates Zn-induced neuronal
  death. Additionally, seleno-L-methionine (Se-Met) and a conjugated protein consisting
  of thioredoxin and human serum albumin (HSA-Trx) suppress ROS production and attenuate
  Cu/Zn neurotoxicity. It is also possible that Cu causes elevated [Ca2+]i and enhances
  Zn-induced neurotoxicity. Ultimately, the coexistence of Cu and Zn in the same synapse
  triggers neurodegenerative pathways and eventually induces the pathogenesis of vascular-type
  senile dementia. Colored circles represent Zn, Cu, and Ca
