caption: Effects of breast milk Neu5Ac on the composition and function of the infant
  gut microbiota in the Zhengzhou cohort. (a) Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA1
  and PCoA2) of the infant gut microbiota at the genus level based on Bray–Curtis
  distance, with community structure differences tested by adonis analysis of variance
  with 999 permutations. (b) Comparisons of the mean relative abundance of gut microbiota
  at the genus level between the LN group and HN group. Genera with relative abundance
  above 1% are shown in the bar plot. “Others” indicates sum of the bacteria with
  relative abundance less than 1%. (c) Discriminative bacteria between LN group and
  HN group. Genera with relative abundance above 1% are included in the analysis.
  (d) Differences in the microbial metabolic pathway based on level 2 of the KEGG
  database. (e) Differences in microbial lipid metabolic pathway of the KEGG database
  (level 3). (f) Spearman correlation coefficients (r) between gut genera and primary
  bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Orange indicates a positive correlation and green
  indicates a negative correlation. Genera with relative abundance above 1% are included
  in the analysis. Significant correlations with |r| > 0.2 and p < 0.05 are shown
