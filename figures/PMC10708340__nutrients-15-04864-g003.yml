figure_title: Li05 activated the FXR signaling pathway to regulate hepatic bile acid
  synthesis and transport.
caption: Li05 activated the FXR signaling pathway to regulate hepatic bile acid synthesis
  and transport. (A) The concentration of TBA in the liver. (B) Hepatic genes, including
  FXR, SHP, Cyp7a1, and Cyp27a1 expressions, were determined by qRT-PCR. (C) Hepatic
  BA transporter genes, including NTCP, BSEP, MDR1, MDR2, and MRP2 expressions, were
  determined by qRT-PCR. (D) FXR, FGF15, ASBT, OST α/β, and MRP2 expressions in the
  ileum were determined by qRT-PCR. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. p values were calculated using a one-way ANOVA test
