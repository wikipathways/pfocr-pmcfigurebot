figure_title: Tie2 super‐agonist generates large Tie2 clusters and initiates cytoskeleton
  rearrangement
caption: 'Serum‐starved HUVECs were treated with angiopoietins or F‐domain scaffolds
  at 100 nM of F‐domain concentrations for 15 min before cell fixation and immunofluorescence
  stained to visualize FOXO1, Tie2, and α5 integrin. A–CRepresentative images of FOXO1
  localization upon scaffold administration. Scale bars are 10 µm.DQuantification
  of nuclear FOXO1 shown as percent of cells with nuclear FOXO1 stain, 100 cells were
  counted per sample.ECells were stimulated with scaffolds or angiopoietins and stained
  with Tie2 antibodies for analyzing plasma membrane Tie2 clusters. Quantification
  shows the percent % of total cells that exhibit large Tie2 clusters on the plasma
  membrane.F, GH8‐ or H3‐treated cells were analyzed under super‐resolution microscopy
  shows actin protrusions with Tie2 clusters at the tip. Lower panels are Imaris reconstructed
  3D model of the super‐resolution images. Scale bars are 5 µm.HQuantification of
  percent of cells exhibited actin protrusions with Tie2 clusters at the tip. 100
  cells were counted per sample.ITie2‐integrin colocalizing upon F‐domain sheet stimulation
  at 18 nM of F‐domains for 30 min before fixation and immunofluorescence stained
  for Tie2 and α5. Top right: schematic of F‐domain sheet labeled with GFP. Imaris
  reconstructed super‐resolution images of F‐domain sheet attaching to cell, clustering
  Tie2, and inducing α5 integrin colocalization. Scale bars are 1 µm.JQuantification
  of Tie2‐integrin colocalization for cells that have F‐domain sheet (GFP+) attachment.K,
  LRepresentatives immunoblot gel (K) and quantifications (L) for α5 integrin knockdown
  experiments using 40 nM of siRNA. Data information: Each point on all graphs represents
  a biological replicate, n > 3, and bars represent the mean ± SEM. One‐way ANOVA
  with Bonferroni test was used for multiple comparisons to calculate P‐values, and
  t‐test was used for H. (****) indicates P < 0.0001.'
