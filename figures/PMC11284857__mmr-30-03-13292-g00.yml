caption: RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway is an important pathway for osteoclast differentiation.
  RANKL secreted by dental follicle cells can promote osteoclast differentiation when
  it acts on the RANK of osteoclast precursor cells. PTHrP affects tooth eruption
  by regulating osteoclast differentiation. When PTHrP is underexpressed, the formation
  and function of osteoclasts are abnormal, leading to insufficient alveolar bone
  absorption in the eruption pathway and abnormal tooth eruption. In addition, PTHrP
  can inhibit the expression of CD200, leading to the block of osteoclast differentiation.
