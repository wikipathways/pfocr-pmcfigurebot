figure_title: CircRILPL1 is highly expressed in NPC and associated with poor prognosis
  of NPC patients
caption: 'A Schematic diagram of the structure of circRILPL1. Sanger sequencing verified
  that circRILPL1 was formed by reverse splicing of exons 3 and 4 of RILPL1 mRNA.
  F1, R1, F2, and R2: primer sites for detecting circRILPL1 and RILPL1 mRNA are indicated.
  B The differential expression of circRILPL1 in 16 chronic rhinitis epithelial tissues
  and 38 NPC tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. C ISH assays indicated that circRILPL1
  was highly expressed and correlated with the prognosis of NPC patients in 99 NPC
  paraffin tissue sections, as compared with 46 adjacent non-cancerous NPEs. Left,
  representative images of ISH. Magnification: 200×, Scale bar = 100 μm; Magnification:
  400×, Scale bar = 50 μm. Middle, statistical analysis of ISH scores. Right, Kaplan-Meier
  survival analysis showed that the overall survival rate of NPC patients with high
  circRILPL1 expression was significantly lower than that of NPC patients with low
  circRILPL1 expression, p = 0.0009. D The relative expression levels of circRILPL1
  and RILPL1 mRNA in NPC cells were detected after treating with RNase R for 30 min.
  E The intracellular localization of circRILPL1 was detected by RNA cytoplasm/nucleus
  fractionation assay in NPC cells. U6 was used as the nuclear internal reference,
  and GAPDH was used as the cytoplasmic internal control. F The intracellular localization
  of circRILPL1 was detected by FISH in NPC cells. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).
  Scale bar = 20 μm. Data were presented as the means ± SD. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001.'
