caption: Effect of hesperidin (HES) on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in old mice.
  Serum concentrations of (A) estradiol and (B) IGF-1. The protein expression of components
  of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was measured using Western blotting in the (C)
  QUA and (D) GAS muscles. GAPDH was used as a loading control and the phosphorylation
  of each intermediate was normalized to the total expression level of each. Different
  letters indicate statistically significant differences; p < 0.05, a > b > c > d
