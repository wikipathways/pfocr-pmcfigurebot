caption: Evolutionary chart of human molecular pathway of WNT signaling. Blue color
  intensity reflects NGREAGG value, size of nodes is proportionate to averaged dN/dS
  score. Where dN/dS information is missing, a node is given in rhombic shape. Nodes
  where no NGREAGG values are available are shown in yellow. A number in brackets
  stands if the node has the same name but a different number of molecular participants
  in different pathways under analysis
