caption: 'A malfunctioning HGD enzyme (indicated with a red cross) in the tyrosine
  metabolic pathway (left) causes accumulation of HGA. The drug nitisinone (NTBC)
  inhibits the upstream 4-HPPD enzyme, thereby blocking HGA production. In untreated
  AKU, excess HGA is released (mostly from the liver) into systemic circulation and
  delivered to target tissues, leading to ochronosis (i.e., deposition of a black,
  melanin-like pigment). Ochronosis affects several body compartments (right), with
  serious consequences especially for load-bearing articular joints, heart valves,
  and aortic vessels. Enzyme abbreviations: TA, tyrosine aminotransferase; 4-HPPD,
  4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase; HGD, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase; MAAI, maleylacetoacetate
  isomerase; FAA, fumaryl acetoacetase. Created with BioRender.com (https://www.biorender.com/,
