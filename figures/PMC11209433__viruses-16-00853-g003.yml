caption: 'The heatmap displays mRNA pathway scores derived from Nanostring Advanced
  Analysis, with COVID-19 positive (+) specimens represented by grey rows and COVID-19
  negative (−) specimens by salmon-colored rows. Each column represents a differentially
  expressed mRNA, and patient sample numbers are indicated as rows. Notably, COVID-19
  positive sample 2 appears unclustered with other COVID-19 positive samples. Expression
  levels are color-coded: blue indicates lower expression, black indicates no expression,
  and gold indicates higher expression'
