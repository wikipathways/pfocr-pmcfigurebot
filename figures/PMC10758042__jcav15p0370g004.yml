figure_title: Avasimibe increased ROS stress and induced cell cycle arrest accompanied
  by activated PPARγ signaling pathway.
caption: 'Avasimibe increased ROS stress and induced cell cycle arrest accompanied
  by activated PPARγ signaling pathway. (A-B) The production of ROS was detected by
  flow cytometry analysis and the statistical diagram, **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001.
  (C-D) The cell cycle distribution of BLCA cells after avasimibe treatment was analyzed
  by flow cytometry. (E) Immunofluorescence staining of PPARγ (Red) in BLCA cells
  with/without avasimibe treatment. Nuclei were stained by DAPI (blue). The scale
  bar is 200 μm. (F) Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the content level
  of proteins associated with ROS, cell cycle and PPARγ'
