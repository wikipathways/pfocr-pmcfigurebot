caption: Scotopic and photopic light response transience of mouse RGCs(A) Perievent
  rasters show the light responses of two ON (top two panels; cell# 1 and 2) and two
  OFF (bottom two panels; cell# 3 and 4) RGCs evoked by a photopic, homogeneous, full-field
  light stimulus. The horizontal bar on the bottom represents the on- (white) and
  offset (black) of the stimulus; each recording represents 4 trials of the same cell.
  For both the ON- and the OFF subpopulations, transient (cell 1 and 3) and sustained
  (cell 2 and 4) responses were present as well.(B) Frequency histogram showing the
  relative abundance of RGC transience (PSTHτ) values for the ON (white) and OFF (black)
  RGC subpopulations (see the  sections for PSTHτ calculations). The histogram displays
  a wide range for both ON- (white) and OFF (black) transience values but fails to
  clearly separate transient and sustained RGC populations, due to the presence of
  numerous cells with intermediate response kinetics.(C) Panels show PSTHs and corresponding
  peristimulus rasters (six trials of the same RGC) for an OFF RGC under control conditions
  (top panel) and for the same RGC following an APB (50 μM) treatment while the retina
  was stimulated by scotopic stimuli. Horizontal bars represent the on- (gray) and
  offset (black) of the scotopic light stimulus. Clearly, the pharmacological intervention
  deleted all RGC responses attesting that the primary rod pathway carried the corresponding
  signals.(D) Representative ON RGC light responses (raster to the left and PSTH to
  the right for the same RGC) were evoked first by scotopic (top) and then photopic
  (bottom) full-field light stimuli. This change in the stimulus strength induced
  a clear alteration of the response amplitude but the overall shape (response delay
  and decay) of this particular cell remained largely unchanged. Similarly, a representative
  OFF RGC displays light responses that, besides subtle changes in response amplitude,
  appear similar in scotopic (top) and photopic (bottom) stimulating conditions.(E)
  Diagram displays PSTHτ value pairs for individual RGC light responses in scotopic
  (black) and photopic (red) light stimulations. Clearly, the change in stimulus strength
  induced the alteration of PSTHτ values for many examined RGCs, however, the overall
  range of response transience values for the entire RGC population were comparable
  (or greater) in scotopic conditions than those obtained with photopic stimulation
  paradigms.(F) Floating bar diagrams show a similar variability of RGC response PSTHτ
  values in both scotopic (gray) and photopic (white) conditions. Shown are mean values
  (line) , 25% and 75% quartiles (boxes), standard deviation (whiskers).
