caption: 'Schematic diagram of the metabolic responses of hard clams to hypo-salinity
  stress. The four boxes in a row near each metabolite represent different groups:
  S30, S10_8h, S10_1d, and S10_5d. Colors of each box indicate the relative content
  of each metabolite. Red indicates high content, and blue indicates low. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  web version of this article.)'
article_title: Metabolomics and biochemical assays reveal the metabolic responses
  to hypo-salinity stress and osmoregulatory role of cAMP-PKA pathway in Mercenaria
  mercenaria.
