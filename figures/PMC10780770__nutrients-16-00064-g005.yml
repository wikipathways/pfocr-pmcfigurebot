caption: BMP8B represses PPARγ transcription via SMAD2/3 signaling, resulting in a
  block to adipocyte differentiation. (A) After induction of adipogenic differentiation,
  the KEGG pathway was downregulated in LV-Bmp8b vs LV-ZsGreen1 3T3-L1 cells. (B)
  The KEGG mapper showed downregulated genes (rectangles highlighted in green) in
  the PPAR signaling pathway. (C) The PPARγ promoter region is shown in a schematic
  representation. Three binding sites and sequences of SMAD2/3 TF are predicted. (D)
  Wild-type and mutation plasmids of predicted SMAD2/3 TF binding sites are shown
  in a schematic drawing. (E) Quantification the activity of pGL3-Pparγ-promoter and
  mutation promoter plasmids with pCMV-Bmp8b or vectors in HEK293T. Renilla was used
  as the internal control. The symbols in the charts represent three biological replicates.
  The data were presented as mean ± SD and analyzed using one-way ANOVA (ns not significant,
  *** p < 0.001)
