  in cirrhosis.
caption: NETs directly promote macrophage-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation in
  cirrhosis. (A) Representative immunofluorescent staining of ACTA2 (green) and CD68
  (red) in monocytes exposed to NETs. Scale bars = 100 µm. (B) Western blot analysis
  for the ACTA2 expression of macrophages after coincubation with NETs, NETs plus
  DNase, or vehicle. (C) QPCR analysis for TGF-β signaling pathway genes in differentiated
  cells. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. (D) Representative immunofluorescence staining
  for MMT by co-expressing CD68 (red) and ACTA2 (green) in PVT from cirrhotic rats
  by day 7. Scale bar = 200 μm. (E) Reconstructed 3D modeling further demonstrates
  spindle-like myofibroblast morphology of MMT cells in the livers of cirrhotic rats
  with PVT by day 2. (F) Representative three-color immunofluorescence staining for
  CD68 (red), ACTA2 (green), and COL1A1 (white) in the livers of cirrhotic rats with
  PVT and without PVT. Scale bar = 200 µm. (G) TSNE plots showing cell populations
  (left panel) and expression of ACTA2 and CD68 (right panel) separately and superimposed
  together in the dataset. (H) Stratification of cells based on their levels of expression
  of ACTA2 and CD68. (I) Confocal imaging detected MMT in the liver from healthy individuals
  and cirrhotic patients. Scale bars = 200 µm
