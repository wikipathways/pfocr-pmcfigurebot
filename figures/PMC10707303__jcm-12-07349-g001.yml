figure_title: Factors that promote diabetes and DKD.
caption: 'Factors that promote diabetes and DKD. The diagram illustrates that the
  progression of DKD encompasses a range of factors, including metabolic, hemodynamic,
  inflammatory, fibrotic processes, and genetic and epigenetic factors. These components
  impact various pathways that oversee intricate intracellular signaling networks,
  ultimately resulting in both functional and structural alterations within the kidney.
  Abbreviations: DKD: diabetic kidney disease, MR: mineralocorticoid receptor, AGE:
  advanced glycation end products, ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme, RAAS: renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
  system, TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β, MAPKs: mitogen-activated protein kinases,
  PI3K/AKT: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Ak strain transforming, JAK/STAT: Janus
  kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription'
