figure_title: Normal synaptic functions in SrfGFAP-ERCKO mice
caption: Basal synaptic properties in the Schaeffer-Collateral pathway in hippocampus
  were measured in SrfGFAP-ERCKO mice and control littermates at 3 mpi (A, C, E) and
  15 mpi (B, D, F). Analyses of paired-pulse ratio (A, B), post-synaptic response
  to stimulus intensity (C, D) and summated action potential (E, F) did not show any
  significant difference between the two groups of mice. The number of slices recorded
  from are indicated in parentheses. (n=8 control; n=5 mutant mice per group). Unpaired
  t-test. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
