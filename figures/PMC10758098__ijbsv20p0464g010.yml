figure_title: ADAR1 regulated NLRP3 inflammasome activity through the miR-21/A20 signalling
  pathway in sepsis.
caption: 'ADAR1 regulated NLRP3 inflammasome activity through the miR-21/A20 signalling
  pathway in sepsis. (A) The alteration of relative mRNA expression of miR-21 in RAW264.7
  cells with LPS stimulation over time. N=4. (B) Relative expression of miR-21 in
  RAW264.7 cells in the control, LPS, LPS+si-A, and LPS+OE-A groups. N=3. (C) RIP
  assay showing the binding effects of ADAR1 with pre-miR-21 in RAW264.7 cells through
  isolation of RNA‒protein binding complexes via anti-ADAR1 and further qRT‒PCR measuring
  the pre-miR-21 levels. N=3. ***P< 0.001 versus anti-IgG. (D) RAW264.7 cells were
  transfected with miR-21 mimic or inhibitors, and the relative protein levels of
  A20, NLRP3, GSDMD, caspase-1, and IL-1β were assessed using Western blotting. N=3.
  (E) Above: relative mRNA levels of miR-21, A20, and NLRP3 in PBMCs from healthy
  subjects (N=4) and patients with sepsis (N=8). **P< 0.01, ***P< 0.001 versus Nor.
  Below: relative mRNA levels of miR-21, A20, and Nlrp3 in mouse lung tissues of the
  sham and CLP groups. N=3. **P< 0.01 versus sham. (F) Relative mRNA expression levels
  of several potential miR-21 target genes in RAW264.7 cells transfected with miR-21
  mimic or inhibitors are shown. The genes related to pyroptosis and inflammation
  were screened from TargetScan. N=3. (G) Dual luciferase activity assay showing the
  direct binding effects of miR-21-5p with its target gene A20 in RAW264.7 cells.
  N=3. **P< 0.01. (H) Relative mRNA expression levels of A20, Nlrp3, caspase1, Gsdmd,
  Il1β, and Il6 in Raw264.7 cells transfected with A20 siRNA (si-A20) determined by
  qRT‒PCR. N=4. (I) Western blotting of A20, caspase-1, cleaved GSDMD, and IL-1β in
  Raw264.7 cells transfected with si-A20. N=3. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. *P<
  0.05, **P< 0.01, ***P< 0.001 versus Ctrl. ns=no statistical significance'
