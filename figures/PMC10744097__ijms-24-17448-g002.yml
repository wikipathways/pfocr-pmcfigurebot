caption: Proteomic variations in kiwifruit following Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae
  (Psa) challenge. (A,B) Volcano plot shows the differentially expressed proteins
  (DEPs) with fold change ≥ 1 and p ≤ 0.05 in kiwifruit following Psa infection at
  24 (A) and 48 hpi (B). The horizontal coordinate represents the multiple changes
  (log2 fold change), and the vertical coordinate represents the p-value of Student’s
  t-test (−log 10 p-value). The up- and downregulated proteins are shown in red and
  blue, respectively. (C,D) Gene ontology enrichment analysis of DEPs from I24H vs.
  control (C) and I48H vs. control (D) pairwise comparisons. GO terms are categorized
  according to molecular function, biological process and cellular component. (E,F)
  The pathway enrichment analysis on DEPs from I24H vs. control (E) and I48H vs. control
  (F) pairwise comparisons. The enriched pathways for upregulated and downregulated
  DEPs are shown in red and purple, respectively. (G) SA signaling pathway is involved
  in the responses of kiwifruit to Psa infection
