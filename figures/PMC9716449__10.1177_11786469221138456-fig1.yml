caption: Assessment of the contribution of the MEK/ERK pathway to TDO-dependent Kyn
  production in A172 cells. (A) The relative ability of Kyn production in 21 cell
  lines. The levels of Kyn production were determined by Ehrlich reaction 24 hours
  after addition of L-Trp (final concentration 524 μM) to the cultured cells. (B)
  The scatter plot shows cell viability (x-axis) and Kyn production (y-axis) from
  the results of the kinase library screening (270 compounds, final concentration
  10 μM). The hit compounds are shown as red data points. The levels of Kyn production
  were determined by Ehrlich reaction 24 hours after addition of L-Trp (final concentration
  524 μM) to the cultured cells. The compounds were added 1 hour before addition of
  L-Trp. (C) Western blot analysis of A172 cells treated with the indicated concentration
  of trametinib. The analysis was performed 24 hours after addition of L-Trp (final
  concentration 524 μM) to the cultured cells. Trametinib was added 1 hour before
  addition of L-Trp. α-tubulin was used as a loading control. (D) Kyn production and
  cell viability in A172 cells treated with the indicated concentration of trametinib.
  680C91 was used as a positive control. The levels of Kyn production were determined
  by Ehrlich reaction and cell viability was determined by WST-8 reagent 24 hours
  after addition of L-Trp (final concentration 524 μM) to the cultured cells. Trametinib
  was added at the indicated concentrations 1 hour before addition of L-Trp. (E) Effect
  of trametinib on enzymatic activity of rhTDO. 680C91 was used as a positive control.
  The levels of Kyn production were determined by Ehrlich reaction. (F) Relative TDO
  mRNA expression level in A172 cells treated with the indicated concentration of
  trametinib. The mRNA expression level was quantified by qRT-PCR 24 hours after addition
  of L-Trp (final concentration 524 μM) to the cultured cells. Trametinib was added
  1 hour before addition of L-Trp. (G) Western blot analysis of A172 cells treated
  with the indicated concentration of trametinib. The analysis was performed 24 hours
  after addition of trametinib to the cultured cells. α-tubulin was used as a loading
  control. (H) Relative TDO mRNA expression level in A172 cells transfected with siRNAs
  targeting MEK/ERK signaling. The mRNA expression level was quantified by qRT-PCR
  72 hours after siRNA transfection. Non-targeting siRNA was used as a control and
  siTDO was used as a positive control. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments
  and values are expressed as the means ± SD of triplicate samples. **Indicates P < .01
  using Dunnett’s test comparing to DMSO (D-F) or control (H).
