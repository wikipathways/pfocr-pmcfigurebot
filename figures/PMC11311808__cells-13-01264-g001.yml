caption: Hallmarks of AC disease pathogenesis and progression detected in human patients.
  The central hallmark of AC is the fibro-fatty substitution of the myocardial tissue,
  being linked to the instability/disruption of intercalated discs (IDs) and desmosomes,
  the activation of FAPs (fibroblast activation proteins), the dysregulation of signalling
  pathways such as Wnt/Î²-catenin, and inflammation. Inflammatory infiltrates are associated
  with necrotic and/or apoptotic myocyte death, leading to electrical instability,
  arrhythmias, and SCD. Image created with BioRender
