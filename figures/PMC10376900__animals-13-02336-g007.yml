  pathway were analyzed in the livers of the control, fasted, and refed geese.
caption: The mRNA expression levels of DEGs in the cytokine−cytokine receptor pathway
  were analyzed in the livers of the control, fasted, and refed geese. The fasted
  group was fasted for 24 h, the refed group was fasted for 24 h and then refed for
  2 h, and the control group had free access to feed and water. IGFBP2 mRNA levels
  were measured using qPCR. *, ** denote p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 for the fasting group
  vs. the control group, or the refeeding group vs. the fasting group, respectively.
  n = 8. The internal reference gene was β-actin and all data are presented as the
  mean ± SEM
