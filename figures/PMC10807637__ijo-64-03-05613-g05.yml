caption: HDAC inhibitors target IRS4 to enhance anti-AR therapy in AR-positive triple-negative
  breast cancer. Proposed working model. The activation of KRAS inhibits the expression
  of IRS4. The low expression of IRS4 can promote the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signalling to promote tumour proliferation. However, the combination of chidamide
  and enzalutamide can increase the expression of IRS4, resulting in blockade of the
  transmission of KRAS signals, and thus inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.
  Finally, tumour proliferation can be inhibited through cell cycle arrest. IRS4,
