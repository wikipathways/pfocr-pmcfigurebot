  profiles of the genes involved in glucosinolate metabolism pathway.
caption: Effects of selenium treatment on purple flowering stalks on transcript profiles
  of the genes involved in glucosinolate metabolism pathway. (A) Schematic diagram
  of GSL biosynthetic pathway, including biosynthesis of core GSL structure and secondary
  modification. (B) Effects of selenium treatment on purple flowering stalks on glucosinolate
  contents. According to Duncanâ€™s test, different letters indicate a statistically
  significant difference (p < 0.05)
