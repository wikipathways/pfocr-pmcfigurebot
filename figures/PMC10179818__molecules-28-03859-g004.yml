caption: '(A) Left: Overlap of the genes that are hypermethylated in control and hypericin-treated
  mice and hypomethylated in UCMS mice. Right: Overlap of the genes that are hypomethylated
  in control and hypericin-treated mice and hypermethylated in UCMS mice. (B,C) KEGG
  pathway analysis and GO analysis of hypermethylated genes in control and hypericin-treated
  mice and hypomethylated in UCMS mice. (D) Validation of m6A methylation level of
  genes enriched in the neurotrophin signaling pathway in the hippocampus among three
  groups (n = 3 mice per group). (E) mRNA level of genes enriched in the neurotrophin
  signaling pathway in the hippocampus among there groups (n = 5 mice per group).
