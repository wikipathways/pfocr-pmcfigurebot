figure_title: Potential mechanism of action of apocynin in vivo and in vitro following
  cigarette smoke exposure.
caption: 'Potential mechanism of action of apocynin in vivo and in vitro following
  cigarette smoke exposure. We demonstrated that targeting cigarette smoke-induced
  lung inflammation and oxidative stress using concomitant apocynin treatment alleviated
  systemic inflammation and oxidative stress as well as anxiety-like behaviors in
  BALB/c mice. Stimulating human microglial cells (HMC-3) with a conditioned media
  treatment derived from lung epithelial cells treated with cigarette smoke extract
  led to upregulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative
  stress markers. Apocynin reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, potentially
  through inhibition of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. BALF:
  bronchioalveolar lavage fluid, ROS: reactive oxygen species, ERK1/2: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2, Nox2: NADPH oxidase 2, Il-6: interlukin-6, TnfÎ±:
  tumor necrosis factor-alpha'
