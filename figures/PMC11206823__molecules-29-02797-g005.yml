caption: RT-PCR and Western blotting validated differentially expressed miRNAs involved
  in the Wnt signaling pathway caused by GHaK treatment and expressions of their target
  genes. (A). RT-PCR analysis confirmed up-regulations of miR-4516, miR-4284, and
  miR-204-5p in PC-9 (t = −18.74, −16.26, and −18.07, respectively, p < 0.01) and
  A549 cells (t = −12.00, −17.64, and −9.70, respectively, p < 0.01) with additional
  up-regulations of miR-12136, miR-4463, and miR-1296-3p in PC-9 cells (t = −8.70,
  p < 0.01; t = −4.32, −4.24, p < 0.05) caused by GHaK treatment. (B). RT-PCR analysis
  confirmed down-regulations of the target genes Wnt 8B, DVL3, and FOSL1 in both PC-9
  (t = 6.83, 7.98, and 5.30, respectively, p < 0.01) and A549 cells (t = 5.68, 6.49,
  p < 0.01; t = 4.49, p < 0.05) with an additional down-regulation of FZD2 in PC-9
  cells (t = 5.00, p < 0.01) involved in the Wnt signaling pathway caused by GHaK
  treatment. (C). Western blotting analysis confirmed down-regulation expressions
  of p-GSK-3β, cyclinA1, and CDK2 in A549 cells (t = 19.46, 46.00, and 44.50, respectively,
  p < 0.01) and p-GSK-3β, cyclinB1, and CDK1 in PC-9 cells (t = 25.36, p < 0.01; t
  = 4.52, p < 0.05; t = 72.00, p < 0.01) involved in the Wnt signaling pathway caused
  by GHaK treatment. (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01)
