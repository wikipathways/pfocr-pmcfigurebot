caption: NF-κB activation and type I IFN responses in A253 cells activated by a high-lactate
  environment. (A, B) EdU, FITC-PE and CCK-8 staining showed changes in proliferation,
  apoptosis and the cell cycle of A253 cells after 24 h of incubation in medium supplemented
  with different concentrations of lactate. (C) Changes in intracellular lactate levels
  in response to different lactate concentrations. (D) Western blot analysis of the
  expression of IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, IFN-α and IFN-β upstream pathways in A253 cells
  treated with different lactate concentrations for different times. (E) Immunofluorescence
  shows the extent of NF-κB penetration into the nucleus
