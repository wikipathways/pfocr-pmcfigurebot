caption: 'Anti-tumor effects of PT-treated CT26 cells. (A) Relative cell viability
  of PT in CT26 cells. After incubating CT26 cells with PT for 24 h, the morphology
  of the CT26 cells was observed under an inverted microscope at 400× magnification
  (Top). Scale bar=50 µm. An MTT assay based on the optical density of the solubilized
  formazan was performed on two to three wells per group, and the OD was measured
  twice for each sample (Bottom). (B) IF assays for Ki67. After IF staining, the number
  of Ki67 positive cells were counted in two field of views with total area of 67,500
  mm2 per field of view in each well. The Ki67-stained samples were prepared on two
  to three wells per group and Ki67 positive cells was counted twice for each sample.
  Scale bar=75 µm. (C) MAPK and (D) Bax/Bcl-2 signaling pathway analysis. After treatment
  with PT for 24 h, the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Cas-3 and Cleaved Cas-3 proteins
  as well as p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, p-p38 and p38 proteins were detected using specific
  antibodies. The cell homogenates were prepared on two to three dishes per group
  and western blots were analyzed twice for each sample. The data was presented as
  the mean ± SD. *P<0.05 vs. No group. #P<0.05 vs. Vehicle group. AEC, aqueous extract
  of Ecklonia cava; PT, phlorotannin; IF, immunofluorescence; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinases; p, phosphorylated; No, untreated; HiAEC, high concentration of
  AEC; Lo, low concentration; Mi, middle concentration; Hi, high concentration; p,
  phosphorylated'
