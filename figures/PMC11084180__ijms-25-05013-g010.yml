figure_title: The expression levels of MsDC-SIGN and TLR4 signaling pathway genes
  post stimulation of M.
caption: The expression levels of MsDC-SIGN and TLR4 signaling pathway genes post
  stimulation of M. salmoides by A. hydrophila. (A) The expression pattern of MsDC-SIGN,
  TLR4, NF-κB, and IL10 in the intestine post stimulation. (B) The expression pattern
  of MsDC-SIGN, TLR4, NF-κB, and IL10 in the liver post stimulation. * Indicates that
  there is a significant difference between the two groups of data in the experimental
  group and the control group (p < 0.05); ** indicates that the difference between
  the two groups of data in the experimental group and the control group is extremely
  significant (p < 0.01)
