figure_title: Activation of senescence pathways is blocked by the pub4 mutation
caption: Senescence is induced in fc2 mutants under cycling light conditions and blocked
  by the pub4 mutation. (a) Expression data from the DESeq2 analysis of the included
  RNA-seq data set was used to create a heatmap of genes associated with senescence.
  Increased and decreased expression relative to wt is indicated by yellow and green,
  respectively. (b) Representative images of detached 3rd and 4th rosette leaves from
  plants grown in constant (24h) light conditions. The leaves were incubated in the
  dark with water (control conditions) or with 100 μM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) for
  3 days. (c) Measurement of the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm)
  of leaves in panel b. (d) Total chlorophyll content of leaves in panel b. Statistical
  analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA tests, and the different letters above
  the bars indicate significant differences within data sets determined by Tukey-Kramer
  post-tests (P ≤ 0.05). Separate analyses were performed for the different treatments,
  and the significance of the MeJA treatment is denoted by letters with a prime symbol
  (ʹ). Statistical analyses of genotypes between conditions were performed by student’s
  t-tests (*, P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ns, P ≥ 0.05). n = 3 whole leaves from separate
  plants. Error bars = +/− SEM. Closed circles indicate individual data points
