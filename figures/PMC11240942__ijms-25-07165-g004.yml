figure_title: KLF4 suppresses the progression of HCC through a RICTOR way.
caption: KLF4 suppresses the progression of HCC through a RICTOR way. (A) The down-regulation
  of KLF4 in HCC activated the mTOR signaling pathway. Top 20 statistics of KEGG pathway
  enrichment based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after KLF4 knockdown
  in MHCC-97H cells. In the scatter plot, RichFactor was the ratio of DEG numbers
  noted in this pathway term to all gene numbers noted in this pathway term, indicating
  intensiveness. p-value ranges from 0 to 1, and a lower p-value represents greater
  intensity. The mTOR signaling pathway was one of the most regulated biofunctions
  upon KLF4 knockdown. (The red frame indicated the selected pathway in this study.)
  (B) The relative mRNA levels of genes in the mTOR complex were analyzed in MHCC-97H
  cells (top) and MHCC-97L cells (bottom). (C) Western blot assays showing the relative
  levels of KLF4 and RICTOR after KLF4 knockdown in MHCC-97H and MHCC-97L cells. (D,E)
  Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that higher RICTOR expression was associated with
  shorter overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) curves in the TCGA
  HCC cohort (n = 276). (F–H) Knockdown of RICTOR attenuated the KLF4-induced suppression
  of HCC cell growth, as evaluated by CCK8 assay (F), colony formation assays (G),
  and EdU assay (H). (I) Representative images, tumor volume, and tumor weight were
  assessed after the subcutaneous injection of MHCC-97H cells. Five mice were included
  in each group. Statistical results are presented as mean ± SD (from triplicates),
  and significance was determined by Student’s t-test (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001, ns = no significance)
