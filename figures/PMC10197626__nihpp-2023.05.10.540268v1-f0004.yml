figure_title: Activation of the CRH/CORT/GR signaling pathway causes the switch in
  serotonergic neurons and generalized fear
caption: (A) Schematic of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. (B) Triple staining
  of the PVN in mice sacrificed 30 min post-shock and in no-shock controls. (C) Time
  course for c-fos expression in CRHPVN neurons; n=100 to 150 cells/mouse; n=4 mice/group.
  (D) Time course for the level of plasma CORT; n=6–12 mice/group. (E) Experimental
  design to test whether CORT increases generalized fear. (F) Generalized fear of
  mice injected with CORT or Veh, given a single 0.5 mA shock or no shock. (G) Numbers
  of neurons coexpressing GAD67 or VGLUT3 in mice sacrificed immediately after behavior
  tests. n=4 mice/group. (H) Experimental design to block activity of CRHPVN neurons
  and test fear. (I, J) Conditioned and generalized fear of CRH-Cre mice injected
  with AAV-DIOKir2.1-zsGreen, AAV-DIO-EGFP, or AAV-DIO-hM4D(Gi). n=5–7 mice/group.
  (K) Numbers of neurons coexpressing GAD67 or VGLUT3 in mice sacrificed immediately
  after behavior tests. n=4–5 mice/group. (L) Experimental design to block CORT synthesis
  by injecting Metyrapone (Met) or antagonize glucocorticoid receptors by injecting
  RU486 and test fear. (M, N) Conditioned and generalized fear. n=4–8 mice/group.
  (O) Neuron numbers in mice sacrificed immediately after behavior tests. n=3–4 mice/group.
  (P) Experimental design to interfere with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression
  using shRNA (shGR) and test fear. (Q, R) Conditioned and generalized fear. n=4–6
  mice/group. (S) Neuron numbers in mice sacrificed immediately after behavior tests.
  n=3–4 mice/group
