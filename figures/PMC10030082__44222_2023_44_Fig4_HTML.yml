caption: a, Constructs for antibody expression and glycan engineering. The expression
  of antibodies requires the simultaneous delivery of two (IgG) or three (multimeric
  antibodies) genes into plants. Although genes of interest (GOIs) can be expressed
  by highly potent vectors, glycan engineering uses low-expressing to medium-expressing
  modules, with appropriate regulatory elements,,,,. The modules may be co-delivered
  in single-gene or multi-gene constructs, together with the antibody genes. b, Human
  sialylation pathway engineering in plant cells. Starting from the sugar nucleotide
  uridine diphosphate (UDP)-GlcNAc, which is abundantly present in plants, the recombinant
  expression of six foreign proteins is needed for in planta generation of sialylated
  N-glycans. The foreign proteins act in the cytoplasm, nucleus and Golgi. Mouse UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine
  kinase (GNE), human N-acetylneuraminic acid phosphate synthase (NANS) and human
  cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase (CMAS) are required
  to produce the activated sugar nucleotide precursor CMP-Neu5Ac. Mouse CMP-sialic
  acid transporter (CST) transports CMP-Neu5Ac to the Golgi, where it is transferred
  to the acceptor substrate, galactosylated N-glycans, by rat α-2,6-sialyltransferase
  (ST) to form sialylated structures. Galactosylated structures are generated by human
  β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT), an enzyme that transfers UDP-galactose to GlcNAc-terminating
  structures. GlcNAc-terminated glycans and UDP-galactose are plant-intrinsic elements;
  however, GalT has to be expressed ectopically. c, Model of pentameric IgM. The protein
  contains complex N-glycans, which are represented in red and blue, and oligomannosidic
  glycans, which are shown in orange and red (top view). 35S-P and 35S-T, cauliflower
