caption: Hallmark signaling pathway analysis of Schlafen 5 (SLFN5) in colorectal adenocarcinoma
  (COAD). TCGA colorectal cancer patients were stratified into two groups based on
  the median SLFN5 expression value. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was then
  performed on these two groups using the Hallmark database. Results of the analysis
  revealed relevant enriched pathways in COAD groups with elevated SLFN5 expression
