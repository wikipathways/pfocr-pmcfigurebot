caption: 'Schematic diagram of organic acid metabolism pathways in A. eriantha. (A)
  Metabolic pathways of malic acid and citric acid in A. eriantha. CS: citrate synthase,
  ICDH: isocitrate dehydrogenase, ALMT: AL-activated malate transporter, MDH: malate
  dehydrogenase, NAD-ME: malic enzyme. (B) Determination of titratable acid, malic
  acid, and citric acid in A. eriantha. Letters indicate significant difference. (C)
  Analysis of the expression patterns of two NAD-ME genes during the maturation process
  of A. eriantha. Asterisks indicate significant difference'
