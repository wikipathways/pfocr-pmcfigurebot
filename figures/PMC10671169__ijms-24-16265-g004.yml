caption: The effect of NXC736 on NLRP3 pathway signaling. (A) The altered expression
  of inflammation- and fibrosis-related genes by heatmap using RNA sequencing in irradiated
  2 and 6 week mice lung tissue (n = 3). (B) qRT-PCR analysis for NLRP3 and IL-1β
  after L132 cells exposed to 6 Gy IR (n = 3). (C) Representative immunohistochemical
  images and quantification of irradiated mice’ lung tissues using anti-NLRP3, caspase-1
  and IL-1β antibodies. Magnification, 40×, 400× (n = 3~5). (D) Western blotting analysis
  of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, caspase-1, and IL-1β expression after in L132
  cells exposed to 6 Gy IR (n = 3). Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. All
  experiments were performed in triplicate. Tukey’s test was utilized to assess significant
  differences between individual groups. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation
