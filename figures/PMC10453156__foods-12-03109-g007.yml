caption: Effects of ECS on the contents of several critical proteins involved in the
  inflammation signaling pathway. (a) Immunoblotting of p-IκBα/IκBα, p-NF-κB/NF-κB,
  and COX-2 proteins. (b–d) Relative expression of p-IκBα/IκBα, p-NF-κB/NF-κB, and
  COX-2 proteins, respectively. The relative protein expressions were normalized with
  β-actin and Group C, shown as grayscale. (e,f) The immunohistochemical results of
  N-NF-κB entering into the nucleus. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. (n = 4).
  For each protein, significant differences are marked by different letters (p < 0.05).
  p-IκBα/IκBα, p-NF-κB/NF-κB, COX-2, and N-NF-κB represent phosphorylated-inhibitor
  kappa B alpha/inhibitor kappa B alpha, phosphorylated-nuclear factor κB/nuclear
  factor κB, cyclooxygenase-2, and nuclear-nuclear factor κB, respectively; C, M,
  EL, and EH represent control, model, low-dose, and high-dose ECS groups (300 or
  600 mg kg−1 of b.w.), respectively
