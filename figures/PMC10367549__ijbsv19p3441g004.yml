caption: Comparison of the functions of T cells between the large and small prostates.
  (A) KEGG pathway plot of T cells between large and small prostates. The left side
  is large prostates, and the right side is the small prostates. (B) GO BP pathway
  plot of T cells in large and small prostates. A positive value of counts indicates
  that the relevant pathways are up- regulated in the large prostates. (C) Metabolic
  pathway plot of T cells in large and small prostates. (D-E) GZMB, GZMK and GZMA
  expression violin plot and gene plot of T cells in large and small prostates. (F-H)
  Representative pictures of IHC staining of GZMB, GZMK and GZMA in prostate transition
  zone tissue and statistical bar graphs, Right bars graph indicates statistical results
  of IHC. (I) Cell-to-cell communication of PARs signaling pathway in large prostates.
  (J) Specific ligand-receptor pairs contributing to the PARs signaling pathway in
  large prostates. (K) Correlation statistics between GZMA and microvessel density
  in prostates based on IHC. (* p<0.05; ** pâ‰¤0.01)
