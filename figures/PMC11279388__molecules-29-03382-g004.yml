caption: |-
  The effects of REO on the Nrf2 signaling pathway. (A) A549 cells were pretreated with REO samples (12.5, 25, 50 μg/mL) for 24 h, followed by incubation with H2O2 (0.1 mM) for 4 h. The total protein was lysed and extracted with RIPA buffer, and the protein levels of (B) Nrf2, (C) NQO1, and (D) HO-1 in each group were determined by Western blot. Blots are representative of three independent experiments. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Oltipraz (30 μM) was used as the positive group (POS). All experiments were repeated three times independently. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. #
  p < 0.05 as compared with the control group. * p < 0.05 as compared with the H2O2 group
