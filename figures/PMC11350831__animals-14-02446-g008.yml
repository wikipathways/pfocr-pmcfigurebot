caption: Effect of LEP_X1 overexpression on milk fat synthesis in BuMECs with PRL.
  Changes are shown for the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway (A), the mTOR signaling pathway
  (B), fatty acid synthesis and desaturation (C), regulation of transcription (D),
  LEPR expression (E), and cellular TG concentration (F). Data are presented as means
  Â± SEM for three individual cultures; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
