figure_title: Scoring of senescence-associated gene sets at the level of brain region
  and broad cell types
caption: '(a) Fraction of senescence associated gene sets changed with age across
  brain region and broad cell types(b) Genes comprising senescence-associated gene
  sets used for scoring in (a). Genes in bold italics denote significant aDAGs(c)
  Clustermap of significant aDAGs at the level of brain region with strength of association
  enumerated as coefficient estimate (magenta, significant positive association with
  age; blue, significant negative association with age). Brain regions ordered by
  hierarchical clustering.(d) Clustermap of significant senescence-related aDAGs at
  the level of broad type. Broad types ordered by hierarchical clustering.(e) Clustermap
  of significant senescence-related aDAGs at the level of cell subtypes. Cell types
  ordered by hierarchical clustering.Abbreviations: CSP, canonical senescence pathway;
  CSS, custom senescence signature; DAM, disease-associated microglia; SIP, senescence
  initiating pathway; SRP, senescence response pathway'
