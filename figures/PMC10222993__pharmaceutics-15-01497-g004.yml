  (PG) signaling pathway.
caption: The aquaporin-3 (AQP3)/phospholipase-D2 (PLD2)/phosphatidylglycerol (PG)
  signaling pathway. Keratinocytes throughout the epidermis express AQP3, a water,
  glycerol, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) channel that associates with the lipid-metabolizing
  enzyme PLD2, also expressed throughout the epidermis [86]. PLD2 can convert the
  glycerol transported by AQP3 to the phospholipid PG, which serves as a signal to
  inhibit Toll-like receptor activation and regulate keratinocyte proliferation and
  differentiation (please see text). Created with Biorender.com (accessed 30 April
