caption: Conditioned medium from human pluripotent stem-cell-derived ectomesenchymal
  stromal cells promotes neurogenesis and neuritogenesis via the ERK/CREB signaling
  pathway. (A,B) Arrowheads indicate cells with neurites. U0126 and CREB inhibitor
  KG501 completely abolished CM-enhanced neurogenesis in PC-12 cells. (C) The activation
  of CREB by forskolin promoted neurogenesis. U0126 did not attenuate this effect,
  suggesting that CREB is downstream of ERK [64]. Arrowheads indicate PC-12 cells
  with neurites. Scale bar, 100 µm
