figure_title: PRV1 P gene products inhibit the type I IFN signaling pathway by interaction
  with STAT1.
caption: PRV1 P gene products inhibit the type I IFN signaling pathway by interaction
  with STAT1. (A) PRV1 proteins antagonize the type I IFN signaling pathway. HEK293T
  cells cultured in 24-well plates were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing PRV1
  proteins, or the empty vector (EV), pRL-SV40, and a luciferase reporter plasmid
  pISRE-Luc. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 units/mL of human
  IFNα for 16 h to stimulate the production of ISGs. Firefly and Renilla luciferase
  activities were measured with cell lysate. Relative luciferase activity is the ratio
  of firefly luciferase reporter activity to Renilla luciferase activity. The relative
  luciferase activity of EV with stimulation was set as 100%. Each data point shown
  represents a mean value from two biological replicates, and each experiment was
  repeated at least three times. Error bars show standard deviations of the normalized
  data. The expression of PRV1 proteins in HEK-293T cells was evaluated by Western
  blot analysis with anti-FLAG mAb M2. The SV40 larger T antigen (TAg) was detected
  as the loading control (B). (C) The nucleus translocation of STAT1. HEK-293T cells
  were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing P gene products, or the empty vector
  (EV), and a plasmid expressing EGFP-STAT1. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were
  treated with 100 units/mL human IFN-α for 2 h or mock-treated. Cells only expressing
  EGFP-STAT1 and treated with human IFNα were used as the positive control, whereas
  cells only expressing EGFP-STAT1 and mock-treated were used as the negative control.
  The scale bar is 20 μm. (D) HEK-293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing
  individual P gene products or the empty vector (EV). At 24 h post-transfection,
  cells were treated with 100 units/mL of human IFNα for 2 h. Western blot analysis
  with whole-cell lysate (WCL) was performed to detect STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1
  (pSTAT1) using specific mAbs listed in MATERIALS AND METHODS. The expression of
  P gene products was also verified by Western blot analysis, and GAPDH was detected
  as the loading control. (E) HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing
  P gene products, or the empty vector (EV), and a plasmid expressing EGFP-STAT1.
  P gene products were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG mAb M2. Western blot analysis
  with IP eluents and whole-cell lysate (WCL) was conducted to detect EGFP-STAT1 and
  P gene products. GAPDH was detected as the loading control. **, p-value < 0.01;
  ***, p-value < 0.001; ****, p-value < 0.0001
