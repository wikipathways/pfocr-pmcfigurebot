caption: 'Targeting transcription factor YY1 for antitumor therapy. (A) DETA-NONOate
  inhibits YY1 binding to the promoter. (B) Betulinic acid inhibits YY1 through cannabinoid-receptor-dependent
  disruption of microRNA-27a:ZBTB10. (C) JAC1 targets YY1-mediated JWA/p38 signaling
  to inhibit tumor proliferation. (D) YY1BM inhibits the interaction between YY1 and
  the androgen receptor, which in turn decreases expression of eEF2K through the AR
  signaling pathway. (E) Synthetic peptides with the OPB domain disrupt the regulation
  of YY1 by competitive binding. (F) Antibody-based inhibition of YY1 through inhibition
  of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. (G) Nucleic-acid-based inhibition of YY1. (H) CRISPR/Cas9
  genome editing of YY1. (I) Role of YY1 in immunotherapy based on CAR-T cells. AKT:
