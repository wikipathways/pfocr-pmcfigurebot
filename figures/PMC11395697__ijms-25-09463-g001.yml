caption: Conventional adenoma–carcinoma sequence pathway of colorectal cancer development.
  (A) The first stage involves hyperproliferation, where there is an increased rate
  of cell division and growth within the colonic epithelium. This is depicted as a
  slight thickening of the epithelial lining. (B) As the process progresses, small
  adenomatous polyps begin to form. These polyps are benign growths protruding into
  the colonic lumen and are represented as small, spherical structures attached to
  the epithelial lining. (C) Over time, some of these small polyps can grow larger,
  forming large adenomatous polyps. These are shown as larger spherical masses connected
  to the colonic wall. (D) Within these larger polyps, severe dysplasia occurs, characterized
  by abnormal cell growth and organization. This stage is visually depicted by the
  presence of an irregular, yellow-colored growth within the polyp structure. (E)
  The dysplastic cells in the polyp can then transform into an adenocarcinoma, which
  is an invasive malignant tumor. This stage is represented by a large, irregularly
  shaped mass protruding into the colonic lumen, with a distinct boundary separating
  it from the surrounding normal tissue. (F) In the final stage, the adenocarcinoma
  has progressed to a full-blown colorectal cancer. This is depicted as a large, irregular
  mass filling a significant portion of the colonic lumen, indicating advanced tumor
  growth and invasion. Figure created using BioRender (https://www.biorender.com/
