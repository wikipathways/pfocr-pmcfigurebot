caption: The E3 ubiquitin ligases pulled down by MGF300-2R were screened through Gene
  Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment
  and the protein–protein interaction network. (A) Obtaining and analyzing the immunoprecipitation
  samples containing the proteins pulled down by MGF300-2R. (B) Venn diagram counted
  328 different proteins pulled down in the HEK293T transfected with pFlag-MGF300-2R
  compared with the HEK293T transfected with vector pCMV-Flag. (C,D) KEGG pathway
  analysis and GO category functional enrichment according to three categories (cellular
  components, molecular functions and biological processes) were performed for 328
  proteins. (E) The protein–protein interaction network of the proteins that interacted
  directly with TRIM21 was analyzed against the STRING database
