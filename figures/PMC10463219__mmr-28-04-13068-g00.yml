figure_title: PA induces lipid deposition and insulin resistance in C2C12 cells.
caption: 'PA induces lipid deposition and insulin resistance in C2C12 cells. (A) Glucose
  concentration in the culture medium was increased after PA treatment for 24 h. (B)
  Oil red O staining of C2C12 cells revealed lipid deposition 24 h after PA treatment;
  magnification, ×400, scale bar, 100 µm. (C) TG content was increased in C2C12 cells
  after PA treatment. (D) Effects of PA treatment on the mRNA expression levels of
  insulin pathway indicators (IRS-1, PI3K, AKT and GLUT4) in C2C12 cells. (E) Effects
  of PA treatment on the protein expression levels of insulin pathway indicators in
  C2C12 cells. (F) Semi-quantification of p-protein/t-protein ratios for insulin pathway
  indicators (IRS-1, PI3K, AKT) and protein expression levels of GLUT4 in C2C12 cells
  after PA treatment. All cells were treated with 100 nM insulin for 30 min before
  (A) detection of glucose contents and (E) western blotting. Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05 vs. CON, #P<0.05 vs. PA1 (0.1 mM), &P<0.05 vs. PA2
  (0.25 mM). CON, control; PA, palmitic acid; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1;
  GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; p-, phosphorylated; t-t, total; TG, triglyceride'
