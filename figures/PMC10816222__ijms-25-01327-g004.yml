figure_title: Analysis of hormone expression patterns in Arabidopsis with D14 gene
  overexpression.
caption: 'Analysis of hormone expression patterns in Arabidopsis with D14 gene overexpression.
  (A,B) Abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis and detection of signaling pathway expression
  levels; (C,D) jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis and detection of signaling pathway expression
  levels; (E,F) salicylic acid (SA) synthesis and detection of signaling pathway expression
  levels; (G,H) auxin synthesis and detection of signaling pathway expression levels;
  (I,J) brassinosteroid (BR) synthesis and detection of signaling pathway expression
  levels; (K,L) gibberellin (GA) synthesis and detection of signaling pathway expression
  levels; (M,N) ethylene (ET) synthesis and detection of signaling pathway expression
  levels; the expression levels of WT lines were normalized. Using Student’s t-test,
  asterisks indicate significant differences: non-significant (ns) and p < 0.01 (**).
  Data are shown as mean ± SD from three independent experiments'
