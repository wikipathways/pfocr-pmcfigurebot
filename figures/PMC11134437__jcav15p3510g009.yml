caption: '“GBP5 O.E.” stands for the cell cohort transfected by GBP5 overexpressed
  vector. (A) Gene set in the high-GBP5 group was enriched in the JAK-STAT pathway
  according to the result of GSEA. (B) Accompanied by GBP5 expression elevation, the
  transcription levels of JAK2, STAT1, CASP1, and GSDMD were upregulated, while STAT2,
  STAT3, CASP3, and GSDME had no significant change. (p-Value: ** p < 0.01, * p <
  0.05, ns p > 0.05) (C) The exogenous overexpression of GBP5 improved the cell death
  rate tested by TUNEL staining; typical results were selectively shown at 10×. (D)
  Through western blotting, p-STAT1 expression was elevated in GBP5-overexpressed
  cohorts, while the cleavage and activation level of CASP1 and GSDMD increased while
  the total CASP1 slightly increased and total GSDMD remained steadily unchanged.
  The change brought by GBP5 exogenous overexpression can be blocked by STAT1 inhibitor
  fludarabine in rescue test. (E) The secretion of IL-1β was quantitatively detected
  by ELISA test in cell line HEY, as part of the rescue test. (p-Value: ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001)'
