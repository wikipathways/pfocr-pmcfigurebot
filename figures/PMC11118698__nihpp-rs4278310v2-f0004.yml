figure_title: Activation of NRF2 protects myeloid NCOA4 KO mice from Salmonella-induced
  colitis
caption: '(A) Body weights and (B) colon lengths, qPCR analysis of the proinflammatory
  cytokines (C) Il1β and (D) Tnfα, (E) Immunoblot analysis of key antioxidant proteins
  in the NRF2 signaling pathway and NCOA4 were conducted on colon tissues from control
  or Salmonella-treated KO mice (n=3–8) and WT mice (n=3–7) treated with either vehicle
  control or NRF2 activator Oltipraz. Statistical significance was denoted as *p<0.05,
  **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001 vs WT control or #p<0.05, ##p<0.01 vs KO control.
  Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied'
