figure_title: HCMV regulates the classical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
caption: HCMV regulates the classical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. When the Wnt
  pathway is switched off (the Wnt receptor complex is not bound to the ligand), GSK3α/β
  phosphorylates β-catenin, which is then ubiquitinated and rapidly destroyed by proteasome
  targeting. In the nucleus, binding of Groucho to TCF/LEF inhibits transcription
  of Wnt target genes. When the Wnt signaling pathway is opened, the Fzd/LRP receptor
  complex activates the classical signaling pathway. Receptor recruitment to Dvl serves
  as a docking platform for components of the β-catenin disruption complex. Wnt induces
  GSK3β and CK1/CK2 to phosphorylate LRP5/6, which regulates Axin docking and releases
  β-catenin. In the nucleus, β-catenin replaces Groucho in Tcf/Lef, thereby promoting
  transcription of Wnt target genes. HCMV reduces the poly-ADP-ribosylation activity
  of end-anchor polymerase, thereby stabilizing Axin and inhibiting the Wnt pathway.
  HCMV US28 inhibits GSK3 activity via the ROCK pathway, β-catenin cannot be phosphorylated
  for degradation HCMV US28 inhibits GSK3 activity through the ROCK pathway, and β-catenin
  cannot be phosphorylated and degraded
