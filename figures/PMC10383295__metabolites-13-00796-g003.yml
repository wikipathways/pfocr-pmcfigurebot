caption: 'Levels of toxicity in the ROS-induced apoptosis of cancer cells. Toxic levels
  of ROS can cause irreversible DNA damage and promote a variety of apoptosis signaling
  pathways, such as the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway, endoplasmic reticulum
  apoptosis signaling pathway, and a variety of pro-apoptotic signaling pathways,
  thus inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Abbreviations: Akt, protein kinase B; Apaf-1,
  apoptotic protease activating factor 1; Bad, pro-apoptotic protein; Bcl-2, B-cell
  lymphoma-2; Bax, BCL2-associated X-protein; Bid, BH3-interacting domain death agonist;
  CD8+ T cell, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; Cyt C, cytochrome C; CRT, calreticulin; Caspase-3,
  cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3; Caspase-6, cysteinyl aspartate specific
  proteinase 6; Caspase-7, cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 7; Caspase-9, cysteinyl
  aspartate specific proteinase 9; CHOP, C/EBP-homologous protein; COX1, cyclooxygenase-1;
  DLC1, deleted in liver cancer-1 gene; DYRK1A, dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation
  kinase 1a; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress;
  FADD, Fas-associated protein with death domain; HMGB1, high mobility group box;
  HSP70, heat shock proteins 70; HSP90, heat shock proteins 90; MAPK, mitogen activated
  protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; P-p38, phosphorylated P38 protein;
  P-ERK, phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinases; P-JNK, phosphorylated
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase; P-BRCA1, phosphorylated breast cancer susceptibility genes;
  PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; P70S6K, p70 ribosomal protein kinase S6; PGC-1α,
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-coactivator-1alpha; PGC-1β, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-coactivator-1beta; RAD51, RAD51 family of
  genes; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD1, superoxide dismutase-1; SOD2, superoxide
  dismutase-2; tBid, truncated Bid; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; TNFR1, tumor
  necrosis factor receptor 1; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand; TRADD, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-associated death domain; UPR, unfolded
  protein response; γH2AX, phosphorylated histone H2AX.'
