figure_title: The prognostic significance of PLAUR levels in ccRCC was analyzed
caption: (A) OS survival curves from the TCGA database (n = 541). (B) PFI survival
  curves from the TCGA database (n = 539). (C) Time-dependent PLAUR ROC curve analysis
  in ccRCC. (D) Forest plot illustrating the results of univariate Cox regression
  analysis in ccRCC. (E) The forest plot presents a visual representation of the results
  obtained from conducting a multivariate Cox regression analysis on ccRCC data. (F)

  database. (G) Nomogramâ€™s calibration curve.
