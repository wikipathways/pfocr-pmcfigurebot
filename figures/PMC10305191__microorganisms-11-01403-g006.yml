figure_title: Metabolic pathway differences in gut microbiota using PICRUSt2.
caption: Metabolic pathway differences in gut microbiota using PICRUSt2.0 to predict
  the MetaCyc pathway between the gut microbiota of the DK group and the CK group
  of taekwondo athletes after dietary intervention. Each column on the vertical axis
  represents the mean level of this pathway in each sample group. Yellow represents
  the exercise group, and blue represents the control group. The horizontal axis on
  the left represents the proportion of each metabolic pathway. The horizontal axis
  on the right indicates the difference between the different groups. The middle area
  is the difference in the percentage of family abundance between the two groups within
  the set confidence interval. The color of the dots indicates the group with greater
  horizontal plenty, and the I-shaped intervals of the dots indicate the upper and
  lower limits of the differences
