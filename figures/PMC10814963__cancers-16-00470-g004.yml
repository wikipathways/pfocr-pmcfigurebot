caption: 'A proposed model for Fyn-CD133 signaling to the PI3K pathway induces melanoma
  intrinsic and acquired resistance to anti-cancer agent in melanoma cells. (A) Fyn
  stimulated CD133 signaling to the PI3K pathway in melanoma population bearing the
  BRAF wild type (BRAFWT) is mediated by Fyn/CD133/PI3K/PDK1/AKT-induced inhibition
  of p27, Fyn/CD133/PI3K/AKT/MDM2-induced ubiquitination of p53 and Fyn/CD133/Grb2/Grb7/NRAS7BRAF/MEK/ERK-induced
  cell growth. (B) Intrinsic resistance of melanoma cells: Fyn stimulated CD133 signaling
  to the Grb2/Grb7/NRAS7BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway is responsible for acquired resistance
  of BRAF inhibitors (e.g., dabrafenib)'
