caption: Nine machine learning classification algorithms for the identification of
  core regulatory genes and pathways in the adventitia and intima of abdominal aortic
  aneurysms. 7A-B represent the ROC indices for core genes and pathways in the training
  and validation sets for the vascular adventitia, respectively. 7C displays a forest
  plot of model characteristics for the nine machine learning algorithms used for
  the vascular adventitia. 7D-E show the ROC indices for core genes and pathways in
  the training and validation sets for the vascular media, respectively, while 7F
  presents a forest plot of model characteristics for the nine machine learning algorithms
  used for the vascular media
