figure_title: KEGG annotation map of all significantly differentially expressed genes
  in ISPCM/IS vs.
caption: 'KEGG annotation map of all significantly differentially expressed genes
  in ISPCM/IS vs. HSPCM/HS (A). Expression profiles of DEGs related to plant hormone
  signal transduction (B), MAPK plant signaling (C), and carotenoid biosynthesis,
  phenylpropane biosynthesis, and plant-pathogen interactions (D). Differentially
  expressed gene-enriched KEGG pathway specific to HSPCM/HS (G), ISPCM/IS (F), and
  significant enrichment of the KEGG pathway with differentially expressed genes common
  to the ISPCM/IS and HSPCM/HS groups (E). S: salt stress treatment (50 mM NaCl +
  0 mg·L−1Pro-Ca); SPCM: Pro-Ca and salt stress combination treatment (50 mM NaCl
  + 100 mg·L−1Pro-Ca)'
