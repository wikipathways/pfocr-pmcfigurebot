caption: 'Current endocrine and targeted treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer.
  Antiestrogen therapy including selective estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen),
  aromatase inhibitors (anastrazole, letrozole, exemestane), and selective estrogen
  receptor degraders (fulvestrant) continues to be the treatment backbone of hormone
  receptor-positive breast cancer since tamoxifen FDA approval in 1977. Improvement
  in the understanding of the molecular biology of estrogen-positive breast cancer
  led to the development of effective targeted therapies such as CDK4/6 inhibitors
  (palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) and inhibitors of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway (alpelisib, capivasertib), as well as improvement in the delivery and potency
  of traditional endocrine therapy including oral selective estrogen receptor degraders
  (elacestrant). * Anticipated regulatory approval during the fourth quarter of 2023.
