caption: The pathway and molecular schematic diagram of astrocyte and BMEC cell-derived
  CXCL3 promoting M1 type differentiation of microglia. Meningitic E. coli infection
  of BMECs and astrocytes induced the upregulation of CXCL3. CXCL3 binds to CXCR2
  then promotes microglia M1 polarization. At the same time, CXCL3 induced ERK1/2
  phosphorylation and promoted pro-inflammatory factors expression, resulting in exacerbation
  of neuroinflammation
