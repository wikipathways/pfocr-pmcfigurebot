figure_title: Expression profiling of key gene families in the reconstructed starch
  and sucrose metabolic pathway.
caption: 'Expression profiling of key gene families in the reconstructed starch and
  sucrose metabolic pathway. Eight critical structural gene families were identified:
  INV (insoluble isoenzyme), HXK (hexokinases), G6PI (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase),
  PGM (phosphoglucomutase), GLGB (glycogen branching enzyme), UGPA (UDP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase
  2), SUS (sucrose synthase), and AMY (amylase)'
