caption: The effect of doxorubicin and exercise training on the expression of the
  NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. Representative immunoblots of NLRP3, caspase-1,
  and IL-1β in comparison with GAPDH expression in ventricular tissue lysates from
  saline-sedentary, saline-exercise, doxorubicin-sedentary, and doxorubicin-exercise
  rat are shown (A). The bar graphs show protein levels of NLRP3 (B), cleaved-caspase-1
  (C), and cleaved-IL-1β (D). Proteins were determined by immunoblotting and were
  normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for analysis. Data
  are presented as the fold change over the saline-sedentary group. The data are presented
  as mean ± SEM for six–eight rats per group. * p-value < 0.05, ** p-value < 0.01,
  *** p-value < 0.001 using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Turkey’s test.
