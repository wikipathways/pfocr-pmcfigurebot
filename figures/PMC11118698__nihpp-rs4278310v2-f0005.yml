  Curcumin Protect Against Salmonella-Induced Colitis in Myeloid NCOA4-Deficient Mice
caption: '(A) Colon length, qPCR analysis of the proinflammatory cytokines (B) Il6,
  (C) Tnfα, and (D) Il1β, (E) immunoblot analysis of key antioxidant proteins in the
  NRF2 signaling pathway in colon tissues from Salmonella-treated KO mice (n=3–4)
  and WT mice (n=3–4) that received vehicle or 0.064% Tempol in drinking water. (F)
  Colon length, qPCR analysis of the proinflammatory cytokines (G) Il6, (H) Tnfα,
  and (I) Il1β, (J) immunoblot analysis of key antioxidant proteins in the NRF2 signaling
  pathway in colon tissues from Salmonella-treated KO mice (n=3–4) and WT mice (n=3–4)
  that received curcumin (Cur) or myeloid cell targeting nanoparticles conjugated
  curcumin (nano-Cur) treatment. Statistical significance was denoted as *p<0.05,
  **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 or #p<0.05, ###p<0.001 vs KO control. Two-way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied'
