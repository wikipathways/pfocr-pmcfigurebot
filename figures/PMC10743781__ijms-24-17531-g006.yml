caption: BAG5 modulates Akt activation and HGF-dependent cell migration. (A) BAG5
  attenuates the activation of Akt in response to HGF without affecting the activation
  of Erk. HeLa cells transfected with the control vector, or HA-BAG5, were serum starved
  and stimulated with increasing amounts of HGF for 15 min. Then, activation of Akt
  and Erk was detected by Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies, whereas
  their expression was confirmed using antibodies that detect endogenous proteins.
  The expression of transfected BAG5 was confirmed using anti-HA antibodies. Graph
  at the top represents the analysis of Akt phosphorylation determined in three independent
  experiments. Mean ± S.E.M values. *, p < 0.05. (B,C) BAG5 expression reciprocally
  correlates with Akt activation in conditions in which Akt stability is not affected.
  (B) HeLa cells transiently transfected with increasing amounts of shRNA-BAG5 (B)
  or Myc-BAG5 (C) were used to detect Akt activation by Western blot in total cell
  lysates with a phospho-Akt (Ser473) specific antibody. The expression of total Akt,
  as well as transfected Myc-BAG5, was confirmed in the same samples, as indicated.
  The numbers below the top panels (A–C) indicate the normalized densitometric value
  with respect to the condition indicated at 1. (D) BAG5 diminishes HGF-dependent
  chemotactic cell migration. HeLa cells transfected with BAG5 or control plasmid
  were subjected to chemotaxis assays in Boyden chambers in which they were stimulated
  with HGF or 10% FBS, as indicated. Graph represents the analysis of relative cell
  migration determined in three independent experiments. Mean ± S.E.M values. *, p
  < 0.05. A representative result is shown at the bottom of the graph. (E) Model depicting
  the proposed mechanism of Akt regulation by BAG5. Under starved conditions and BAG5
  overexpression, Akt interacts with BAG5, which promotes Akt inhibition and, with
  the participation of Hsp70, leads to its degradation. When the Akt signaling pathway
  is stimulated, the interaction between Akt and BAG5 decreases, coincident with Akt-dependent
  BAG5 phosphorylation
