caption: Metabolomics profiling of the S. algae- and E. coli OP50-conditioned media.
  (A) PCA of the metabolomes of unconditioned medium, S. algae-conditioned medium,
  and E. coli OP50-conditioned medium. Five replicates of S. algae-conditioned medium
  and E. coli OP50-conditioned medium, as well as three replicates of unconditioned
  medium were analyzed. (B) Volcano plot comparing S. algae- and E. coli-conditioned
  media. Log2 fold enrichment in S. algae over E. coli OP50 is plotted on the horizontal
  axis, and the associated p-value is plotted on the vertical axis. The red dashed
  line shows p-value = 0.05. (C,D) Pie charts show the category of DAMs in S. algae
  (C)- and E. coli OP50 (D)-conditioned media. (E,F) KEGG enrichment of the significantly
  changed metabolites. (E) Upregulated pathways. (F) Downregulated pathways. The color
  from red to purple represents the significance of the enrichment
