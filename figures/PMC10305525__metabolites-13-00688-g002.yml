caption: Three major H2S synthesis pathways are of enzymatic, non-enzymatic, and gut
  microbial origin. Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE)
  catalyzes homocysteine to produce l-cysteine. Both CBS and CSE can catalyze l-cysteine
  to generate H2S. 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) produces H2S from 3-mercaptopyruvate
  (3-MP), which is formed by d-amino acid oxidase (DAO) cysteine aminotransferase
  (CAT) from d-cysteine and l-cysteine. Another source of endogenous H2S is derived
  from the non-enzymatic synthesis pathway. The other source of H2S comes from intestinal
  bacteria, mainly from sulfate-reducing bacteria. H2S is metabolized by sulfide quinone
  oxidoreductase (SQR) to form persulfide, which can be oxidized by persulfide dioxy-genase
  (ETHE1) to yield sulfite. Sulfite is converted to sulfate or thiosulfate, which
  can be excreted into the urine
