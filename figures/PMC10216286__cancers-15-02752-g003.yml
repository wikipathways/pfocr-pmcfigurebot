figure_title: TRAIL and DR5 agonist antibodies increase PD-L1 expression.
caption: TRAIL and DR5 agonist antibodies increase PD-L1 expression. TRAIL can induce
  PD-L1 expression by activating the ERK and STAT3 pathways or inhibiting miR-429.
  DR5 agonist antibodies can induce PD-L1 expression by activating ROCK1. Induction
  of PD-L1 then results in EMT, cell survival, immune evasion, and resistance to TRAIL
