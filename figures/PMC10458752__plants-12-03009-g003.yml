  flag leaves of WT and transgenic rice line RD2 using the LC-MS analysis.
caption: KEGG pathway enrichment of differential metabolites identified in the flag
  leaves of WT and transgenic rice line RD2 using the LC-MS analysis. The top 20 pathways
  with the smallest p values are shown by performing the analysis of KEGG pathway
  enrichment. The y-axis represents the pathway category, and the x-axis represents
  the degree of enrichment of the individual pathways. The color of the circle indicates
  the p value, and the size of the circle indicates the number of involved metabolites.
  From red to green indicates the p-value level
