caption: 'Effect of sulforaphane (SFN) pre-exposure on the insulin/insulin-like growth
  factor (IIS) signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) exposed to
  cadmium chloride (CdCl2). Nematodes of strains QQ202 (daf-2 reporter) and TJ1052
  (age-1 mutant) at the L1 stage were initially exposed to SFN. After 24 h, they were
  exposed again, this time to a combination of SFN and CdCl2 for another 24 h. Additional
  groups were created and exposed to 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, SFN vehicle) for
  48 h, CdCl2 (4600 μM) for 24 h, and SFN (100 μM) for 48 h. Once the exposure times
  were completed, the corresponding evaluations were carried out. (A) Relative fluorescence
  of DAF-2::GFP (n = 60 nematodes divided into 4 independent experiments), (B) representative
  fluorescence images of strain QQ202 (daf-2(cv20[daf-2::GFP]) (scale bar indicates
  200 μM), III), (C) percent survival of strain TJ1052 (age-1 mutant), (D) effect
  of CdCl2 on the survival of strain TJ1052 (age-1 mutant) compared to wild type (WT),
  (E) percentage of survival protection in the SFN+CdCl2 group of strain TJ1052 (age-1
  mutant) compared to WT (n= 3 independent bioassays with 3 technical replicates each),
  and (F) schematic representation of signaling the IIS path. age-1: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase orthologous gene, AGE-1: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gene protein, AKT1-2:
  protein kinases B, daf-16: forkhead box O (FoxO) orthologous gene, DAF-18: PTEN/human
  tumor suppressor homolog, daf-2: a receptor tyrosine kinase (IGFR) homolog, DAF-2:
