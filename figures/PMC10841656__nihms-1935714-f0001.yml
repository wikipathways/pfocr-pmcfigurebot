caption: High PRL2 expression is associated with enhanced KIT signaling in AML. (A)
  Signaling by KIT in disease, (B) KIT pathway, (C) signaling by SCF-KIT, (D) regulation
  of KIT signaling, and (E) KIT receptor signaling pathway were enriched in AML patients
  with PRL2 high expression compared to AML patients with PRL2 low expression.
