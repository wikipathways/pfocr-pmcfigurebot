figure_title: Effect of TGFβ1 silencing and CBX7 knockdown on the expression of key
  genes in the PI3K/AKT and ITGβ3/TGFβ1 signaling pathways.
caption: 'Effect of TGFβ1 silencing and CBX7 knockdown on the expression of key genes
  in the PI3K/AKT and ITGβ3/TGFβ1 signaling pathways. HeLa and SiHa cells with stable
  expression of CBX7 knockdown were transfected with silencing plasmids of TGFβ1.
  The mRNA expression of genes in the PI3K/AKT and ITGβ3/TGFβ1 signaling pathways
  in (A) HeLa and (B) SiHa cells was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR. The protein expression of genes in the PI3K/AKT and ITGβ3/TGFβ1 signaling pathways
  in (C) HeLa and (D) SiHa cells was detected by western blot analysis. Error bars
  in all panels represent the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001, siCBX7
  compared with the control and siCBX7-EVC; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001, siCBX7
  + shRNA TGFβ1 compared with the siCBX7. TGFβ1, transforming growth factor β1; CBX7,
  chromobox protein homolog 7; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; ITGβ3, integrin
  β3; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; CTRL, control; NS, not significant; E-cad, E-cadherin;
  VIM, vimentin; NC, negative control'
