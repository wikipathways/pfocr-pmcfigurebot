caption: The proposed mechanism of vagus-mediated liver regeneration. Muscarinic signals
  from the vagus nerve may stimulate IL-6 production by hepatic macrophages, thereby
  activating the hepatocyte FOXM1 pathway in a paracrine manner, in which resident
  macrophages act as mediators and regenerative signals from the vagus nerve can be
  secreted and propagated throughout the remnant liver via IL-6, thereby enhancing
  compensatory proliferation
