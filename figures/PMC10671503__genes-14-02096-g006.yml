caption: Gene–gene interaction (GGI) and expression analyses of the differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in livers of largemouth bass (M. salmoides) involved in the
  ECM-receptor interaction pathway following heat stress (HS). (a) Regulatory changes
  in the pathway of ECM-receptor interaction under HS treatments. The red and blue
  boxes indicate up- and down-regulated DEGs, respectively. (b) GGI networks of the
  DEGs involved in the ‘ECM-receptor interaction’ pathway. The scale from blue to
  red represents a gradual increase in values of Log2 transformed fold change ratios
  of the DEGs. (c–j) Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) data for the
  mRNA expression levels of the DEGs implicated in the ‘ECM-receptor interaction’
  pathway in the livers of largemouth bass under HS treatments. The values represent
  the relative mRNA levels and are normalized to the mean of the control group. Data
  are given as the mean of three independent biological replicates ± standard deviation
  (SD). Lowercase letters indicate significant differences (Tukey’s test; p < 0.05)
