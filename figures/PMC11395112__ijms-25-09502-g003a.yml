caption: Relationship between O-glycosylation and tumor dormancy according to the
  LUAD scRNA-seq data. (A) The gene sets most strongly correlated with the occurrence
  of DT were identified via hdWGCNA. (B) The t-SNE plots of the expression distribution
  for the different colored gene modules. (C) The PPI plots of protein O-linked glycosylation
  in the DT-associated gene sets. (D,E) Comparison of O-glycosylation (D) and N-glycosylation
  (*** p < 0.001) (E) between the DT and NDT groups. (F) Pseudo-time was represented
  with a color gradient that transitions from dark blue to light blue. (G) Pseudo-time
  trajectory was segmented into seven distinct states using Monocle 2. (H) Pseudo-time
  trajectory divided into DT and NDT groups. (I) Pseudo-time trajectory analysis based
  on AddModule scores shows that O-glycosylation levels change along the pseudo-time
  trajectory. (J) Heatmap showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across various
  branches (cell fate), with enriched Gene Ontology (GO) pathways annotated to the
  left of each gene cluster
