caption: 'PAPS1 regulated the fecal metabolite level in HFD-induced HLP mice. (A)
  OPLS-DA score plot of fecal metabolites among NCD, HFD, and PAPS1 groups. (B) KEGG-enriched
  metabolic pathways of significantly altered fecal metabolites between HFD and PAPS1
  groups. Heatmap (C), the associated heatmap (D), and boxplots (E–O) of significantly
  differential metabolites in intestinal feces among three groups. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± S.E.M. (n = 4). # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001 vs. NCD
  group; * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001 vs. HFD group. KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; NCD: normal chow diet; HFD:
  high-fat diet; PAPS1: Pleurotus abieticola polysaccharide'
