  inference analysis
caption: (A and B) Representative UMAP plot of the 8 different cluster of stromal
  cells is shown in A, while UMAP plot for each sample is shown in B. (C) Dot plot
  for the most common markers for pure pericytes and myofibroblasts. Cell type classification
  and the percentage and average expression of the specific cell markers. (D) Trajectory
  inference analysis of the stromal cell clusters. The crucial node of the pseudotime
  analysis was identified in the transdifferentiating pericyte cluster, with 2 branches
  starting from this point â€” 1 of them toward myofibroblast lineage. (E) Dot plot
  of the pathway enrichment analysis for the upregulated genes of representative cluster
  of pericytes, transdifferentiating pericytes, and myofibroblasts, using gProfiler
  and PathFindR package. Only the most significant differentially expressed genes
  (log2FC > 1 and Padj < 0.01) were chosen for pathway enrichment analysis. The graph
  shows the number of genes modulated in each single pathway, the fold enrichment,
  and the statistical significance
