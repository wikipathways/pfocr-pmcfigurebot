figure_title: Fundamental roles of C1q
caption: a C1q activates the classical complement pathway and induces phagocytosis,
  allowing apoptotic debris clearance. C1q also maintains quiescence by inhibiting
  antigen-presenting DC differentiation, which induces adaptive immunity. In the presence
  of DAMPs or PAMPs, such as HMGB1, C1q not only inhibits proinflammatory cytokine
  production but also promotes anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage polarization that
  is critical for the resolution of inflammation. Once SLE develops, C1q suppresses
  DNA-containing immune complex (IC)-mediated pDC activation. b In contrast, in neuroinflammation
  or tumors, C1q promotes disease progression. In amyloid β plaques in AD or neuroinflammation,
  C1q promotes A1 astrocytes and activates microglia that degrade neurons. C1q and
  HMGB1 promote the loss of dendritic complexity and cognitive impairment. C1q inhibits
  CD8 + T cells and DCs that kill tumor cells.
