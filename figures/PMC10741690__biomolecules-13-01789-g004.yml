figure_title: mtUPR signaling in C.
caption: 'mtUPR signaling in C. elegans. When an accumulation of misfolded and unfolded
  proteins occurs in mitochondria, the CLPP-1 protease is activated and hydrolyzes
  these proteins into smaller peptides, which are then transported to the IMS by HAF-1.
  This decreases the transport of the transcription factor ATFS-1 into the mitochondria,
  causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus. In this
  organelle, ATFS-1 activates the transcription of mtUPR-related genes. Moreover,
  mtUPR involves two transcription factors, DVE-1 and UBL-5, that, in response to
  mitochondrial stress, are transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they
  form a complex that promotes the transcription of mtUPR-associated genes. In addition,
  mtUPR is dependent on several mechanisms of chromatin remodeling. Firstly, this
  stress response pathway is subject to methylation regulation by the histone methylase
  MET-2, which is activated in response to mitochondrial damage. This activation allows
  its cofactor LIN-65 to enter the nucleus, where it carries out H3K9 methylation.
  While most of the chromatin condenses as a result, some regions remain open, and
  it is in these regions that the complex formed by DVE-1 and UBL-5 binds to promote
  transcription of mtUPR-related genes. Furthermore, the histone deacetylase HDA-1
  also contributes to chromatin decondensation, as do the histone demethylases JMJD-1.2
  and JMJD-3.1, allowing for the binding of the DVE-1/UBL-5 complex and triggering
  the transcription of molecular chaperones and proteases to restore mitochondrial
  function. Arrow: activation or induction of the subsequent process'
