figure_title: P2RY12 affects HK2 stability through regulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
  and inhibiting lysosomal degradation in T cells.
caption: 'P2RY12 affects HK2 stability through regulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
  and inhibiting lysosomal degradation in T cells. (A) Immunoblot analysis of the
  indicated phosphorylated (p-) and total proteins in WT cells and P2RY12-/- T cells
  after ConA administration 12 hr. (B) Immunoblot analysis of the indicated HK2, phosphorylated
  (p-) and total proteins in WT and P2RY12-/- T cells stimulated for 24 hr with ConA
  followed by incubation with SC79 in vitro. (C) Flow cytometric analysis the expression
  of IFN-γ in T cells from WT T cells and P2RY12-/- T cells activated for 24 hr with
  ConA followed by incubation with SC79 in vitro. (D) Schematic diagram of SC79 aggravates
  ConA-induced immune hepatitis in P2RY12-/- mice. (E) The serum levels of AST and
  ALT were detected. (F) The serum level of IFN-γ was detected. The proportion of
  IFN-γ (G) and HK2 (H) expression in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells from liver lymphocytes
  were detected. (I) The mRNA level of Hk2 was determined in hepatic T cells gathered
  from WT and P2RY12-/- mice after ConA administration 12 hr. (J) GSEA results indicate
  that genes related to autophagic pathway enriched in hepatic T cells gathered from
  WT and P2RY12-/- mice after ConA administration 12 hr. (K) Western blot analysis
  for the expressions of P62 and LC3 in hepatic T cells. Summary of (K) based on densitometric
  quantification of three independent experiments (right). (L) Hepatic T cells were
  gathered from WT and P2RY12-/- mice after ConA administration 12 hr then immunoprecipitated
  with HK2 antibody. HK2 ubiquitination was determined using anti-ubiquitin antibody.
  IP: immunoprecipitation, IB: immunoblotting. (M) Western blot analysis of HK2 protein
  in WT and P2RY12-/- T cells stimulated for 24 hr with ConA followed by incubation
  with MG-132 and BafA-1 in vitro. (N) Flow cytometric analysis of IFN-γ in T cells
  from WT and P2RY12-/- activated for 24 hr with ConA. Pooled data right presented
  from (N). Data are mean ± SEM. *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01; ***P < 0.001 vs indicated group.
  (two-tailed Student''s t-test). Data are representative of three independent experiments
  with similar results'
