  pathway, the Preiss–Handler pathway, the nicotinamide ribose kinase pathway, and
  the salvage pathway. Adapted from “Overview of BCAA Catabolic Enzymes” by BioRender.com

  and HEK293T cells cultured in the presence of either 8.4 µM nicotinamide (NAM) or
  0.5 mM tryptophan (Tryp) or 0.5 mM 2H5tryptophan (TD5) or 0.5 mM quinolinic acid
  (Quin) or 0.5 mM nicotinic acid (NA) or 0.5 mM 2H4nicotinic acid (D4-NA) (mean ±
  SD, n = 3, t-test with *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; and ****, p <
  0.0001). (C) Total (labeled and unlabeled) concentration of tryptophan, n’-formylkynurenine,
  and kynurenine after 48 h incubation with 0.5 mM tryptophan (Tryp) or 0.5 mM 2H5tryptophan
  (TD5) in A549 and HEK293T cells (mean ± SD, n = 3). Isotopologues are described
  as follows: unlabeled (M + 0), containing 1 deuterium 2H atom (M + 1), etc'
