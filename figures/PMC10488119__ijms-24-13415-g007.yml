caption: Schematic diagram of the regulation of IMF deposition by CPT1A. Significant
  enrichment of MAPK signaling pathway was found by RNA-seq sequencing and analysis
  of CPT1A knockdown and controls. Overexpression of CPT1A inhibits lipid deposition,
  but promotes cell proliferation via the MAPK signaling pathway, thereby altering
  the distribution of lipids in cells to more cells with fewer lipid droplets, ultimately
  allowing for increased IMF deposition. Knockdown of CPT1A inhibits cell proliferation,
  but promotes lipid deposition, thereby altering the distribution of lipids in cells
  to fewer cells with more lipid droplets, ultimately allowing for decreased IMF deposition
