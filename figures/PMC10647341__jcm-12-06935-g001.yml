caption: Simplified mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs. MHC II—major histocompatibility
  complex class II; Ag—antigen; TCR—T-cell receptor; P—phosphate; NFAT—nuclear factor
  of activated T cells; FK-BP—FK506-binding protein; Cphn A—cyclophilin A; IL-2—interleukin
  2; mTOR—mammalian target of rapamycin; LC—lipocortin; PLA2—phospholipase A2; GCR—glucocorticoid
  receptor; GCSs—glucocorticoids; AZA—azathioprine; MMF—mycophenolate mofetil; RAP—rapamycin;
  FK-506—tacrolimus; CsA—cyclosporin A. 1. Antigen-presenting cell presents an antigen
  to a T cell, leading to an inflammatory response 2. Dephosphorylation of NFAT complex
  by calcineurin, a Ca2+ ion-dependent phosphatase. 3. Activation of IL-2 transcription
  through active NFAT complex. 4. IL-2 production 5. Induction of the CD25 receptor
  by IL-2, leading to the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway (whose core consists
  of two protein complexes—mTORC1 and mTORC2), which leads to T-lymphocyte proliferation
  and IL production. 6. CsA binds to cyclophilin to form a complex that inhibits calcineurin.
  7. FK-506 binds to FK-BP, leading to the inhibition of calcineurin. 8. RAP inhibits
  the mTOR pathway. 9. AZA and MMF inhibit DNA synthesis, blocking proliferation and
  IL production. 10. Active GCR receptor complex inhibits COX-2 transcription. 11.
  Active GCR receptor complex stimulates lipocortin production, which leads to the
  inhibition of PLA2
