figure_title: Supplementing HFD with the antioxidant BHA abrogates obesity phenotypes
  and rewires pY and metabolite signatures
caption: '(A-D) Experimental setup and physiological phenotypes of mice on HFD alone
  or HFD+BHA diet. Box and whisker plots with datapoints representing each animal.
  Two-way ANOVA with multiple comparison (Kruskal-Wallis test) was performed comparing
  corresponding HFD + BHA with HFD only groups and statistical significance was assigned:
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. (E) Heatmap of spearman correlation analysis
  of polar metabolomics where columns and rows represent each animal. KDE of metabolite
  Log2(BHA/HFD) illustrating the variance in metabolite intensities between male and
  female samples. (F) Scatter plot of PCA for metabolite changes representing differential
  clustering along PC1, PC2, and PC3. Datapoints represent individual animals. (G)
  Heatmap of mean metabolite intensities altered by BHA and drive clustering along
  PC2, color-coded by pathway. (H) Heatmap of spearman correlation analysis and hierarchical
  clustering of samples based on pY phosphoproteomics. KDE of pY site Log2(BHA/HFD)
  representing variance between males and females. (I) Scatter plot of pY sites PCA
  where changes induced by BHA supplement are along PC1, PC2, and PC3. Data points
  represent individual animals. (J) Heatmap of mean phosphosite intensity of pY sites
  altered by BHA supplement and drive clustering along PC1. (K) Scatterplot of metabolites
  PLSR model score and fold changes, where metabolites with a valid score are color
  coded by pathway. PLSR analysis was performed with leave-one-out cross validation
  to identify pY sites (X-matrix) that predict metabolite (Y-matrix) response to BHA.
  (L, M) Scatter plot of pY sites for representative PLSR models for betaine and ophthalmate,
  where negative (blue) and positive (red) correlation of pY sites are indicated based
  on PLSR coefficient'
