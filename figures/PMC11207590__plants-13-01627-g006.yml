caption: Heatmap and hierarchical clustering showing differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) in four pathways in P. rotata leaves. (A) Frame diagram of major DAMs during
  biosynthesis of iridoids; (B) The ion abundance of iridoids in P. rotata; (C) DEGs
  involved in MVA pathway; (D) DEGs involved in MEP pathway; (E) DEGs involved in
  terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis pathway; (F) DEGs involved in chemical modification
  pathway; HN, MQ, YS, and CD from four different altitude regions. Rectangles marked
  with a red (deep red) and blue background represent the increased and reduced expression
  of genes, respectively
