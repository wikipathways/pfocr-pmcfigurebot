caption: Biosynthetic pathway of pyochelin (PCH) and Pseudomonas quinolone signal
  (PQS) in P. aeruginosa. (A) Biosynthesis of PCH and PQS in P. aeruginosa. The black
  arrows indicate the direction of biosynthesis; the skyâ€“blue font indicates the enzymes
  involved in PCH biosynthesis. The purple font indicates the enzymes involved in
  the conversion of chorismate to anthranilic acid. The green font indicates the enzymes
  involved in the kynurenine pathway, which converts tryptophan to anthranilic acid.
  The orange font indicates the enzymes involved in PQS biosynthesis. The red font
  shows the chemical structure of PCH and PQS. The detailed biosynthesis processes
  are described in the text. (B) PCH biosynthetic genes in P. aeruginosa. (C) PQS
  biosynthetic genes in P. aeruginosa. The square arrow indicates the direction of
  the gene transcription. Different colors represent different transcription units.
  PA gene numbers refer to the PAO1 sequence
