figure_title: The JAK-STAT signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway that affect
  AD.
caption: The JAK-STAT signaling pathway and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway that affect
  AD. Red text indicates the genes that are commonly included in the JAK-STAT and
  PI3K-AKT signaling pathways in all BPA, BPF, and BPS exposure groups from the DMR
  analysis. Hypomethylated genes can be hyperregulated, which can cause the proliferation,
  regeneration, apoptosis of keratinocytes in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and
  skin barrier dysfunction in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Figure created using
