caption: Overexpression of PKP2 improved CLS associated with acute inflammation. (A)
  Successful verification of the overexpression of the PKP2 protein was achieved (data
  represent the results of three independent experiments). (B–D) The mRNA expression
  levels of AQP3, AQP5, claudin1, occludin, and ve-cadherin in HUVECs overexpressing
  PKP2 and stimulated by LPS demonstrated that PKP2 overexpression upregulated the
  expression of CLS-related molecular genes (data represent the results of three independent
  experiments). (E) PKP2 overexpression attenuates the permeability of HUVECs during
  acute inflammation (data represent the results of three independent experiments).
  (F) PKP2 overexpression ameliorates LPS-induced cytoskeleton disorder in HUVECs
  (data represent the results of three independent experiments). (G) Increased protein
  levels of ZO-1, β-catenin, occludin, connexin43, and claudin1 were observed in HUVECs
  with acute inflammation upon PKP2 overexpression and quantitative analysis (representative
  of three independent experiments). (H) Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrating
  the upregulation of claudin1 expression due to PKP2 overexpression in HUVECs with
  acute inflammation (data represent the results of three independent experiments).
