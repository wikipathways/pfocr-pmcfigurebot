caption: The network of pathways involved in maintaining homeostasis of the cellular
  ATP pool in plants.(A) Photosynthesis in chloroplasts dominates the energy contribution
  to the cellular ATP pool during the day. ATP molecules are transported for cellular
  utilization by ANT.(B) The mETC is responsible for the majority of ATP provision
  in the dark.(C) SnRK1α serves as a central energy-deficit sensor in plant cells.
  (1) Fluctuations in sugar level and ATP/ADP ratio are detected by SnRK1α, and a
  series of stress responses are induced. SnRK1α phosphorylates enzymes such as SPS,
  F2KP, NR, class Ⅱ TPS, SUSY, and INVs involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism and
  disrupts the TOR kinase complex through interaction with RAPTOR and the FLZs, leading
  to growth arrest and autophagy activation. SnRK1α translocates to the cytoplasm
  from the nucleus in an SnRK2-dependent manner in response to ABA. (2) SnRK1α phosphorylates
  and destabilizes members of several TF families, including bZIP, ARF, MYB, bHLH,
  NAC, ABI, and WRKY TFs, to adjust the transcription of starvation genes and thus
  modulate the physiological responses to multiple stresses. SnRK1α phosphorylates
  bZIP to induce ETF/ETFQO and donate alternative reducing power for respiration through
  the BCAA catabolism pathway. (3) SnRK1α interacts with CDKE and acts as the mediator
  transcriptional coactivator complex to control nuclear gene transcription in response
  to mitochondrial dysfunction.(D) SnRK1α plays an essential role in retrograde signaling,
  which can lead to the activation of NAC, WRKY, and MYB to induce the expression
  of AOX and UCP directly, altering mitochondrial respiratory pathways. (4) SnRK1α
  participates in MAPK signaling by phosphorylating PTP1 and MAPK3/6, which can phosphorylate
  downstream TFs such as ABI4 to modulate AOX transcription. (5) L-type lectin receptor
  kinases (DORN1) are activated by eATP signaling molecules. Activated DORN1 directly
  phosphorylates the Raf-like MAPKKK ILK5 and subsequently triggers the MAPK cascade
  by activating MAPK3/6 to initiate plant stress responses.ARF, auxin response factor;
