  damage.
caption: Identification of signaling pathways involved in T-2 toxin-induced cartilage
  damage. (a) Cluster heatmap depicting the expression patterns of differentially
  expressed mRNAs. (b) Volcano plot illustrating the differential expression of mRNAs.
  Blue dots show no expression difference from controls. (c) KEGG pathways analysis
  revealing the enriched pathways associated with differentially expressed mRNAs.
  (d) Genes enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway, highlighted in green for downregulated
  genes and red for upregulated genes. Dashed arrows represent indirect regulation
  and solid arrows represent direct regulation. (e) Relative mRNA expression levels
  of MAP2K3, MAPK14, and MEF2C in rat knee cartilage. (f,g) Western blot analysis
  showing the protein expression levels of p38, p-p38, and MEF2C in rat knee cartilage.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3, * p < 0.05 compared to the control group
