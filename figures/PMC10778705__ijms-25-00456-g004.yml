caption: 'Approaches to PRR-targeted therapies for breast cancer. Schematic representation
  of the therapeutic approaches proposed in this review. Left panel: The cGAS-STING
  pathway exhibits alterations in various tumors, including breast cancer. The pathological
  shift of this signaling, from an immunostimulatory state to a protumoral one, can
  be reversed by utilizing STING agonists combined with agents that restore canonical
  NF-ÎºB and IRF3 pathways, hindering cancer progression (left circle). The proposed
  combination of STING agonists with the drug APR-246, known for reactivating the
  tumor suppressor P53 in P53-mutated tumors, is suggested here. The efficacy of these
  therapies could potentially be enhanced through combination with ICB immunotherapies,
  such as anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Right panel: Conflicting data exist in the current
  literature concerning the role of TLR2 in cancer. Consequently, the use of agonists
  or inhibitors must be carefully evaluated based on the specific context. TLR2 agonists
  appear promising in enhancing antigen presentation when coupled with anticancer
  vaccines (right upper circle). However, considering the protumoral roles of TLR2
  as described in this review, TLR2 inhibition might serve as an alternative strategy,
  particularly in tumor subtypes where TLR2 correlates with poor prognosis. Furthermore,
  TLR2 inhibition has shown promising outcomes when combined with chemotherapies inducing
  immunogenic cell death, thereby releasing DAMPs capable of activating TLR2 signaling
  and its described protumoral effects. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 14
