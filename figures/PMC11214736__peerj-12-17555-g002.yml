figure_title: The correlation between PLAUR mRNA expression and clinical features
  is being analyzed based on the TCGA database
caption: 'The correlation of PLAUR mRNA expression in ccRCC with gender (A), age (B),
  tumor stage T (C), lymph node metastasis stage N (D), distant metastasis stage M
  (E), and pathologic stage (F) was investigated. (G) The correlation between PLAUR
  expression and the patient’s clinical characteristics in ccRCC was displayed using
  a heat map. ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, ns: not significant.'
article_title: PLAUR facilitates the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma
  by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
