figure_title: Modeling fibrosis and vascular inflammation in the hToC
caption: a, A schematic of the experimental workflow for the hToC quad-culture assembly.
  b, The effect of the exogenous TGF-β1 treatment was examined on the EC mono culture
  stained for leukocyte adhesion and activation markers VE-cadherin (green, row 1),
  ICAM-1(purple, row 2), and VCAM-1(yellow, row 3) at 24- and 72-hours. Exogenous
  TGF-β1 was added directly to the luminal EC surface, incubated for 72-hours, and
  assessed with the same markers (b, column 3). These results were compared to the
  EC monolayer removed from a 72-hour quad culture (b, column 4). Scale bar = 50 mm.
  The transmigration of fluorescently labeled circulating monocytes (cM ) from the
  vascular compartment to the tissue hydrogel was quantified under various conditions,
  including c, tri cultures (without tM ) or quad cultures (with tM ), d, quad cultures
  without TGF-β1 over time, and e, quad cultures without or with exogenous TGF-β1
  at 72 hours. f, Representative immunofluorescence sections of the tissue hydrogel
  in quad-cultures show fibroblastic morphology in tendon construct in the absence
  or presence of exogenous TGF-β1 treatment. Sections were stained for markers for
  collagen-specific molecular chaperone (HSP47), cellular proliferation (Ki67), myofibroblast
  activation (α-SMA), and mTOR pathway expression (pAKT, p4EBP1, pS6). g, The quad
  culture supernatants were tested from the combined vascular and tissue sides and
  sampled using a multiplex Luminex® assay. The inflammatory cytokine secretory protein
  profile at 24 hours in the presence and absence of exogenous TGF-β1 (N=3–4) is displayed,
  where the dashed blue line represents secretion levels in monocultures (tenocytes-laden
  hydrogels) treated with TGF-β1. Scattered data presented with mean and standard
  deviation marks (n=3 devices). One-way ANOVA was used for comparison (*p < 0.05)
