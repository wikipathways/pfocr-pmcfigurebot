figure_title: Gene expression patterns related to jasmonic acid and salicylic acid
  defense pathways in B.
caption: Gene expression patterns related to jasmonic acid and salicylic acid defense
  pathways in B. rapa (Akimeki) against two P.brassicae isolates (SS and HS2). Heatmaps
  of the relative expression of key genes involved in (a) JA and (b) SA hormones.
  The colors represent the relatively highly and lowly regulated expression of genes,
  as indicated by the row-scaled Z-scores of TMM-normalized TPM values. Gene symbols
  were assigned based on their similarity to Arabidopsis genes, using a BLAST search.
  Differential gene expression induced by SS and HS2 strains is shown, with genes
  exhibiting a fold-change of 4 or more labeled in red and those with a fold-change
  of 2 or more labeled in blue
