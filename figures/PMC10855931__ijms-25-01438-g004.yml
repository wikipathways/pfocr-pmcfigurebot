caption: TonEBP deficiency reduced the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A,B) Western blot of TonEBP, p-NF-κB, and NF-κB of total cell lysis in sh-NC, sh-TonEBP,
  sh-NC+LPS, and sh-TonEBP+LPS groups. N = 3. (C,D) Western blot of NF-κB of cytoplasm
  in sh-NC, sh-TonEBP, sh-NC+LPS, and sh-TonEBP+LPS groups. N = 3. The data are presented
  as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001
