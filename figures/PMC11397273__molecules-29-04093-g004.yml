caption: A model of ubiquitination- and de-ubiquitination-regulating components related
  to milk fat synthesis. In the use of long-chain lipids, ubiquitination regulates
  the translocation of long-chain fatty acids through the lysosomal pathway and influences
  the intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids through ubiquitination-like
  SUMO chemistry. During fatty acid de novo synthesis, ubiquitination affects fatty
  acid chain elongation and translocation in cells by regulating SREBP abundance,
  while de-ubiquitinating enzymes antagonise ubiquitination-mediated degradation of
  target proteins. In fatty acid desaturation and lipid droplet generation, ubiquitination
  affects unsaturated fatty acids and TAG formation by influencing PPARy and ADFP
