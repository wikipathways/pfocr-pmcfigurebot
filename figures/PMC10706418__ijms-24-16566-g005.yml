caption: Analysis of hormone signaling transduction in response to CGMMV infection.
  Joint analyses of hormone signaling pathway in response to CGMMV infection. Red
  blocks represent upregulated genes, green blocks represent downregulated genes,
  and blue blocks represent the genes which are not consistent between different replicates
  of each treatment. Red dot represents that the hormone is up-accumulated
