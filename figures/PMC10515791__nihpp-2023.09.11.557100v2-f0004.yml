figure_title: Phosphorylation circuit-mediated closed-loop sense-and-response function
caption: (A) Using phospho-signaling to connect extracellular sensing to transcriptional
  output. The phosphor-sensor circuit (Fig. 3) was coupled to a two-step amplifier
  circuit (Fig. 2), which was in turn coupled to a phosphorylation-dependent transcriptional
  reporter module (fig. S19), yielding a membrane-to-nucleus signaling pathway. The
  PC is tagged with nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export signals (NES) to
  enable shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HHH plots for PC phosphorylation
  (left column) and EGFP expression (right column) are shown for cells +/− ligand
  for compositions with and without NLS/NES tags. Values in the plots indicate mean
  fluorescence (AU) ± SEM (n=3). Fold-change values are shown to the right of each
  set of plots. (B) Engineering a phospho-signaling pathway for closed-loop therapeutic
  control. HEK293T cells expressing a circuit that can sense TNF-α (green arrow) and
  respond by secreting IL-10 (blue arrow) (top left) are placed in transwell coculture
  with activated T cells (bottom left) for 60 h, with media collected every 12 h to
  measure cytokine levels. T cell proliferation was assessed by EdU assay at 60 h.
  TNF-α and IL-10 time courses are shown for empty HEK293T cells (no circuit), constitutively
  IL-10 expression (open loop), and the sense-and-respond circuit (closed loop). Each
  circle represents a different PBMC donor (black line, mean values; shaded regions,
  ± SEM) (middle). Measurements of CD4+ and CD8+ proliferation, with circles representing
  data from 3 PBMC donors (error bars, indicating mean values ± SEM, n=3 measurements;
  upper dashed line, proliferation [maximum EdU signal] of activated T cells alone
  with no HEK293T cell; lower dashed line, proliferation of activated T cells inhibited
  with 500 ng/ml IL-10 [minimum EdU signal])
