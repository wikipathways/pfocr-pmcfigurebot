caption: Schematic diagram of the most common signalling pathways active in muscle
  and adipocytes during cancer-associated cachexia. (A) During cancer-associated cachexia,
  several pro-inflammatory cytokines are secreted by the cancer cells. TWEAK, IFN-γ,
  TNF-α, IL-6, and LIF were found to enhance muscle catabolism via the p38/MAPK, NF-κB,
  and JAK/STAT pathways. TGFβ and members of its superfamily, including myostatin
  and activin, have been shown to induce muscle atrophy by stimulating FOXO, which
  in turn activates proteosome pathways. IGF-1 tends to trigger PI3K-AKT and mTOR
  signalling in muscle, enhancing protein synthesis. However, IGF-1 levels reduce
  during cancer-associated cachexia, which in turn affects muscle protein turnover
  and contributes to muscle atrophy. (B) Inflammatory cytokines, LIF, ZAG, and PTHrP
  released by the tumour cells also participate in adipose tissue wasting during cancer-induced
  cachexia. TNF-α mediates adipose wasting by decreasing GLUT4 expression, which results
  in inhibition of glucose transport and lipogenesis. Similarly, IFN-γ and PPARα stimulate
  lipolysis by inducing insulin resistance through recduction in glucose uptake. IL-6
  and LIF were found to induce adipose lipolysis by activating the JAK/STAT signalling
  pathway, which causes HSL phosphorylation and therefore fat degradation. PTHrP activates
  UCP-1 in adipocytes, which results in browning of adipose tissue, and phosphorylation
  of HSL, which causes lipolysis. ZAG acts as a lipid mobilizing factor and stimulates
  adipose tissue wasting. Overall, inflammatory cytokines and cachectic factors released
  by the cancer cells activate various signalling pathways that lead to muscle and
  adipose wasting and together contribute to body weight loss during cancer-associated
  cachexia
