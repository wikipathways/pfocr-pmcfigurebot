figure_title: 'Involvement of lncRNA in ferroptosis. LncRNA OIP5-AS1 functions as
  a miRNA sponge to silence miRNA-128-3p, stabilizing SLC7A11 mRNA and inhibiting
  ferroptosis. Nuclear-localized lncRNA LINC00618 interacts with LSH to epigenetically
  block the expression of SLC7A11 and cause increased lipid ROS and iron, thus accelerating
  ferroptosis. Tumor suppressor lncRNA P53RRA can displace p53 to form a cytosolic
  P53RRA-G3BP1 complex, which leads to greater retention of p53 in the nucleus and
  blocks the expression of SLC7A11, finally causing cell-cycle arrest and ferroptosis.
  LncRNA LINC00336 acts as a miRNA sponge for CBS, which acts as a marker of trans-sulphuration
  pathway activity and further inhibits ferroptosis by decreasing intracellular levels
  of iron and lipid ROS. By inhibiting the recruitment of p53 to the promoter of ELAV-like
  (ELAVL) RNA-binding protein, LSH promotes ELAVL1 expression and further assists
  the stabilization of LINC00336. LncRNA RP11-89 promotes the expression of PROM2
  by acting as an RNA sponge to silence the expression of miR-129-5p, which enhances
  the PROM2-mediated formation of ferritin-containing MVBs and the release of iron,
  and finally promotes ferroptosis resistance. LncRNA MT1DP downregulates the expression
  of NRF2 by stabilizing the expression of miR-365a-3p and finally promotes ferroptosis.
  LncRNA GABPB1-AS1 inhibits the translation of GABPB1 by blocking its recruitment
  to polysomes and binding with eIF4A, and finally promotes ferroptosis of HCC cells.
