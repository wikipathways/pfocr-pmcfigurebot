figure_title: Volcanic map of different metabolites in germinated maize under different
  treatments.
caption: 'Volcanic map of different metabolites in germinated maize under different
  treatments. The data are displayed in combined positive and negative ion mode. The
  x-axis shows the log2 fold change, representing the multiple change in each metabolite,
  while the y-axis shows −log10 (FDR-value) from the Student’s t-test. Red dots indicate
  up-regulated metabolites, blue dots indicate down-regulated metabolites, and gray
  dots indicate metabolites with no significant difference. (A) PL24 vs Ck24, (B)
  PL48 vs CK48, (C) PL72 vs CK72. PL: pulsed light, CK: control. the horizontal coordinate
  of the bubble is the enrichment factor, which indicates the size of the influence
  factor of the pathway in the topological analysis, and the size of the bubble indicates
  the number of metabolites in the pathway, and the larger the bubble indicates the
  greater number of differential metabolites in the pathway'
