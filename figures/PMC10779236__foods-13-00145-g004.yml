caption: Main molecular mechanisms regulated by sialic acid. Brain development increases
  the need for sialic acid (SA). GNE (UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine
  kinase) is a critical enzyme for SA biosynthesis. SA is activated to form CMP-SA
  in the nucleus. Then CMP-SA is transported into the Golgi apparatus and serves as
  the substrate of SA for the sialyltransferases, like the polysialyltransferase-2,8-sialyltransferase
  IV and ST8SiaII. SA residues from CMP-SA are transferred to gangliosides and the
  neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), leading to the formation of polysialic acid
  on NCAM (PolySA-NACM). These sialylated structures play a central role in the neurotransmission
  and synaptogenesis, promoting the brain development. Under these conditions, learning
  and memory improvement are related to the upregulation of these gene expressions.
  SA also markedly reduces the inflammatory response. It is worked by the regulation
  of several signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal,
  nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) pathway, and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling
  pathway. SA effectively protects against oxidative damage. The levels of glutathione
  reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and
  glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were increased. The generations of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) were reduced. Anti-oxidant function of SA is regulated by Nrf2 pathway,
  enhancing the expressions of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase
  1 (NQO-1)
