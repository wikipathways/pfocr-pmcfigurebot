caption: Various factors including hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance
  signaling pathways are involved in the NAFL and NASH progression by accelerating
  the inflammatory signaling pathway and its mediated apoptosis. Additionally, continuous
  activities NAFLD involved into accumulating of liver fibrosis and genetic exchange.
  Finally, hepatocarcinoma was activated and patients need to surgical treatment.
