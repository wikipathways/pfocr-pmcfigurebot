figure_title: Effect of sodium sulphate on the insulin signaling pathway in the liver
  tissues of mice fed an HCD.
caption: 'Effect of sodium sulphate on the insulin signaling pathway in the liver
  tissues of mice fed an HCD. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis
  of the biological pathways of differently expressed mRNAs in the livers of mice
  from the CON vs. HCD and HCD vs. HCD + MSS groups. (B) RT-qPCR and western blotting
  results of the Trib3 mRNA and TRB3 protein expression levels in the liver tissues
  of mice from the CON, HCD, HCD + LSS, HCD + MSS and HCD + HSS groups, respectively.
  (C) Western blotting results showing the protein expression levels of p-IRS1 (Tyr608),
  IRS1, p-AKT and AKT in the liver tissues of mice from the CON, HCD, HCD + LSS, HCD
  + MSS and HCD + HSS groups. The right panel shows the semi-quantitative analysis
  of the p-AKT/AKT ratio. GAPDH was used as the internal control for western blotting
  and RT-qPCR. ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001 vs. the CON group; *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001
  vs. the HCD group. HCD, high cholesterol diet; CON, control; LSS, low dose of sodium
  sulphate; MSS, middle dose of sodium sulphate; HSS, high dose of sodium sulphate;
  RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; Trib3/TRB3, tribbles pseudokinase
  3; p-, phosphorylated; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1'

  of Cyp7a1 in hepatocytes and alleviates hepatic insulin resistance via the downregulation
  of Trib3 in mice with high cholesterol diets
