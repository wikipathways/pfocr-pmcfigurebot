figure_title: Pathway analysis for rice wine.
caption: Pathway analysis for rice wine. (A) Pathway analysis diagram of the positive
  ion mode for DOSW-SW. (B) Pathway analysis diagram of the negative ion mode for
  DOSW-SW. Each bubble in the bubble diagram represents a metabolic pathway, and the
  horizontal coordinate and size of each bubble indicate the influence factor of the
  pathway in the topological analysis. The larger the bubble is, the larger the influence
  factor. The vertical coordinate and color of the bubble indicate the p value of
  the enrichment analysis (taking the negative natural logarithm, i.e., âˆ’lnp); the
  darker the color, the smaller the p value, and the more significant the enrichment
