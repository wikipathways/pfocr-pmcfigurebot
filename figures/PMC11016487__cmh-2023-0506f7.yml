caption: 'JCAD mediates hepatic stellate cell activation via the Hippo-YAP signaling
  pathway. (A) YAP transcriptional activity was increased by JCAD. LX2 cells were
  transiently transfected with JCAD-siRNA or myc-JCAD plasmid, TEAD-responsive 8X
  GTIIC luciferase reporter gene. Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-SV40 was
  used as an internal control, and YAP-siRNA or myc-YAP as a positive control (n=3).
  (B) LX2 cells were transfected with siRNAs against the human JCAD gene and treated
  with Lats-IN-1 (1 μM or 5 μM) for 24 hours. LX2 cells were treated with YAP inhibitor
  verteporfin (0.5 and 1 μM) for 48 hours. Total protein levels of α-SMA and YAP were
  assayed by Western blot (n=3). (C) LX2 cells transfected with siRNAs against the
  human JCAD gene were treated with Lats-IN-1 (5 μm) for 24 hours. LX2 cells were
  treated with YAP inhibitor verteporfin (1 μm) for 24 hours. Fibrosis-related gene
  expression was quantified by qRT-PCR (n=3). (D) Immunofluorescent co-staining of
  YAP and α-SMA in immortalized human LX2 cells transfected with the siRNA against
  human YAP gene. The nucleus was visualized with DAPI staining. Red: YAP; Green:
  α-SMA; Blue: DAPI. Image amplification: 1,260×. Scale bars=20 μm. (E) Total protein
  levels of the YAP and α-SMA in immortalized human LX2 cells transfected with the
  siRNA against the human YAP gene were analyzed by Western blot analysis. JCAD, junctional
  protein associated with coronary artery disease; YAP, yes-associated protein. All
  data were expressed as mean±standard deviation. *,**,***P<0.05, 0.01, and 0.001
  compared to Ctrl-siRNA or Ctrl-siRNA-DMEM. #,##,###P<0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 compared
  to Ctrl-siRNA-Lats-IN-1.'
