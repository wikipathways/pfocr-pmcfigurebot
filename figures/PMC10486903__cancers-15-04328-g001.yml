figure_title: TGFβ pathway member SMAD3 is significantly upregulated in dasatinib-resistant
  E2A-PBX1+ ALL cells.
caption: 'TGFβ pathway member SMAD3 is significantly upregulated in dasatinib-resistant
  E2A-PBX1+ ALL cells. (a) Long-term treatment in dasatinib-sensitive and -resistant
  RCH-ACV cell line after 6 days of treatment with vehicle or dasatinib. Cell number
  was assessed every 3 days by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cell proliferation is
  shown for RCH-ACV clone 1 as accumulative data and represents mean of three replicate
  experiments, with error bars indicating ± SD. (b) GSEA plot shows enrichment of
  TGFβ signaling pathway in dasatinib-resistant cells. (c) Volcano plots for differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in KEGG TGFβ signaling pathway for dasatinib-resistant compared
  to sensitive RCH-ACV clones. Red dots indicate upregulated genes; blue dots indicate
  downregulated genes. Q-values < 0.05 and log2 fold change <−1 and >1 were considered
  statistically significant. Expression data were visualized using R software, Version
  4.0.3 (d) Reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) values
  of selected genes involved in the TGFβ signaling pathway and upregulated in dasatinib-resistant
  RCH-ACV clones. Bar denotes mean and error bars, SEM (n = 3). (e) Gene expression
  of TGFβ pathway member SMAD3 was validated using RT-qPCR. GAPDH was used as housekeeping
  gene. Expression of target gene is displayed as normalized to housekeeping gene
  mean concentration. Data are shown as mean of three replicate experiments, with
  error bars indicating ± SD. Statistical analysis by Student’s t-test (*: p < 0.05;
  ***: p < 0.001). (f) Western Blot analysis (representative of two independent experiments)
  shows upregulated protein levels in dasatinib-resistant RCH-ACV cells. Densitometry
  values were calculated using ImageJ software. Protein levels were normalized to
  GAPDH and expressed as fold change relative to dasatinib-sensitive RCH-ACV clone
