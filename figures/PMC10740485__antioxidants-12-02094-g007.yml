caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism of Nrf2 in osteoporosis.
  During the process of differentiation, the modulation of antioxidant enzyme expression
  can be achieved by suppressing the expression of Nrf2 in cells. This suppression
  subsequently results in an elevation in intracellular ROS levels and activation
  of the c-FOS/NFATc1 signaling pathway, thereby facilitating osteoclast differentiation.
  Notably, the inhibition of intracellular ROS levels and c-FOS phosphorylation can
  effectively impede the augmented osteoclast differentiation induced by Nrf2 deletion.
  This finding suggests that Nrf2 possesses the ability to hinder c-FOS expression
  by suppressing cellular ROS levels, thereby exerting an inhibitory effect on differentiation.

  positive activation and red “X” represents depression
