caption: Genomic and non-genomic effects of hormonal signaling. Several hormone pathways
  exist. Ligand-bound nuclear hormone receptors (R) can either directly activate hormone
  response elements (HREs), located on the regulatory sequences of target genes, or
  they bind to other transcription factors (e.g., AP-1). Intracellular nuclear receptors
  can also be activated in the absence of hormone via growth factors (e.g., EGF) via
  kinase-mediated phosphorylation (ligand-independent pathway). In the presence of
  hormone, receptors may also regulate mtDNA transcription. Hormone-activated membrane
  receptors activate protein-kinase cascades (e.g., MAPK signaling pathway) and regulate
  the levels of secondary messengers within the cell (e.g., Ca2+ intracellular influx
  via GPER1). R, hormone receptors (nuclear—blue, plasma membrane—green); HRE, hormone
  response elements; TF, transcription factor; K, kinase; P, phosphorylation
