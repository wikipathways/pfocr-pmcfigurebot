figure_title: NSC-622608 overcomes TKI resistance via downregulation of the AKT/mTOR
  and JAK2/STAT5 pathways.
caption: NSC-622608 overcomes TKI resistance via downregulation of the AKT/mTOR and
  JAK2/STAT5 pathways. (A) PCA results before batch removal for multiple datasets.
  Different colors represent different datasets. As shown in the schematic diagram,
  the three CML datasets (GSE130404, GSE44589, and GSE33224) (n=183) were separated
  without any intersection. PCA results after batch removal, as shown in the schematic
  diagram, showing the intersection of the three datasets, which can be used in subsequent
  analysis. There were 124 patients who achieved a drug response (IM-Rs), and 59 patients
  had no response (IM-NRs). The relative expression of STAT5 in the IM-NR group was
  greater than that in the IM-R group (p<0.001). (B) The correlations between the
  expression of VSIR and that of STAT5A and STAT5B were analyzed with Spearman’s correlation.
  The density curve on the right represents the trend in the distribution of STAT5A
  and STAT5B, and the upper density curve represents the trend in the distribution
  of VSIR expression. The abscissa and ordinate represent genes, and different colors
  represent different correlation coefficients (red represents a negative correlation);
  the darker the color is, the stronger the correlation. (C) Western blots showing
  decreased expression levels of the JAK2, STAT5, p-STAT5, AKT, p-AKT, p-mTOR, 4EBP1
  and p70s6k proteins after treatment with NSC-622608 (0, 5, 10, 20 μM) in KBM5 and
  KBM5-T315I cells for 48 h. (D) At 48 h, the mitochondria-induced apoptosis pathway
  was increased in a concentration-dependent manner after treatment with NSC-622608
  (0, 5, 10, or 20 μM) in KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells. (E) qPCR revealed a decrease
  in JAK2 and STAT5 mRNA expression following VSIR knockdown. (F) The AKT/mTOR and
  JAK2/STAT5 pathways were more strongly activated in K562-R cells than in K562 cells
  according to Western blot analysis. Asterisks (*) indicate significance, *** indicates
  p<0.001, ** indicates p<0.01, * indicates p<0.05, and NS indicates no significance
