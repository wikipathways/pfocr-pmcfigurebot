figure_title: KEGG enrichment analysis of DEPs in GNR2/GNR0 and GNR4/GNR0.
caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of DEPs in GNR2/GNR0 and GNR4/GNR0. (1) (A) indicates
  the DEPs downregulated by GNR2/GNR0; (B) indicates the DEPs upregulated by DR2w/CK;
  (C) indicates the DEPs downregulated by GNR4/GNR0; (D) indicates the DEPs upregulated
  by GNR4/GNR0. (2) The x-axis percentage of proteins is the percentage of protein
  expression, and the y-axis is the pathway information of the top 20 DEPs
