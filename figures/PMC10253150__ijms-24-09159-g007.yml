caption: Biogenic amine synthesis signaling pathway, whose genes were characterized
  by expression significantly regulated in the adrenal medulla. Each gene involved
  in the pathway is marked with a separate rectangle. If the expression of a particular
  gene was up-regulated, this was marked with the corresponding color in the diagram,
  as shown in the legend
