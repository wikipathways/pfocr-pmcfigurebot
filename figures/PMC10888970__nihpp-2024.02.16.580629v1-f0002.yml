figure_title: RNA-seq analysis of Fgfr1FCPG tailbud tissue reveals downregulation
  of genes involved mesodermal patterning, Wnt signaling, and cell adhesion
caption: A) Analysis of a whole-embryo scRNA-seq organogenesis dataset (; ) reveals
  high expression of both Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 from E9.5 to E11.5. B) Bulk RNA-seq analysis
  was performed using tailbud tissue dissected from E9.5, E10.5, and E11.5 embryos.
  Tailbud tissue was cut at the posterior-most definitive somite boundary (dashed
  lines). C) Volcano plots displaying differential gene expression between Fgfr1FCPG/FCPG
  mutants and wild type at E10.5. Horizontal dashed line signifies significance cut-off
  of p=0.05. D) GO Term GSEA of down-regulated genes in Fgfr1FCPG/FCPG tailbuds at
  E10.5. The most significant terms involve skeletal morphogenesis, anterior-posterior
  patterning, and regionalization. E) KEGG Pathway GSEA of down-regulated genes in
  Fgfr1FCPG/FCPG tailbuds at E10.5. Mutants exhibit changes in ECM-receptor interaction
  and focal adhesion genes as well as multiple signaling pathways including Wnt and
  JAK-STAT.
