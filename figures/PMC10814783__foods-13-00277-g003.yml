figure_title: Metabolic Pathways of (A) CS 300 d vs.
caption: 'Metabolic Pathways of (A) CS 300 d vs. 0 d and (B) NS 300 d vs. CS 300 d.
  Note: CS 300 d vs. 0 d meant metabolites of peanuts under CS after 300 days compared
  with that at the initial storage. NS 300 d vs. CS 300 d meant metabolites of peanuts
  under NS after 300 days compared with those of CS after 300 days. The X-axis represents
  pathway impact, and the Y-axis represents the pathway enrichment. The redder the
  color of the bubble, the smaller the p value of the metabolic pathway, and the yellower
  the color of the bubble, the larger the p value of the metabolic pathway'
