figure_title: Cell interactions are increased in HCM myocardium and predominantly
  fibroblast driven
caption: A) Circle plot illustrating the differential number (top) and weight (bottom)
  of ligand-receptor interactions in HCM versus control cells. Red indicates increased
  number or weight of interactions in HCM and blue indicates decrease in number or
  weight of interactions in HCM. B) Circle plots exhibiting the number of ligand-receptor
  interactions in HCM (top) versus control (bottom) cells. C) )Circle plots exhibiting
  the weight of ligand-receptor interactions in HCM (top) versus control (bottom)
  cells. D) Scatter plots for control (top) and HCM (bottom) cells illustrating the
  strength of incoming (y-axis) and outgoing (x-axis) interactions. The size of each
  circle is dependent on the number of interactions. E) Scatter plots illustrating
  differential incoming and outgoing interactions between HCM and control cells in
  fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and endocardium. Each point represents
  a signaling pathway. The shapes define if the pathway is shared (circle), incoming
  specific (square), outgoing specific (triangle), or both incoming and outgoing specific
  (diamond). The color defines if the pathway is shared (black), control specific
  (red), or HCM specific (blue)
