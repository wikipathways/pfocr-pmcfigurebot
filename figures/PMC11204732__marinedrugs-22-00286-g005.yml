figure_title: Effect of SRP on renal lipid oxidation.
caption: 'Effect of SRP on renal lipid oxidation. (A) MDA levels. (B) GSH-Px levels.
  (C) SOD levels. (D) Protein expression of the MAPK signaling pathway components
  in kidney tissue. (E) Protein expression of the MAPK signaling pathway components,
  quantified by densitometry and normalized to β-tubulin. All presented data represent
  the mean ± SD. Significant differences are indicated as follows: “#” indicates values
  that are significantly different from the control group (p < 0.05); “##” indicates
  values that are significantly different from the control group (p < 0.01); “###”
  indicates values that are significantly different from the control group (p < 0.001);
  “*” indicates values that are significantly different from the Cd-AKI group (p <
  0.05); “**” indicates values that are significantly different from the Cd-AKI group
  (p < 0.01); “***” indicates values that are significantly different from the Cd-AKI
  group (p < 0.001); “ns” indicates no significant difference'
