figure_title: 3D scatter plots on three metabolic activities of cells treated by various
  drugs
caption: Each dot indicates the metabolic responses from an individual cell. X-axis
  represents saturated FA metabolism (azido-PA/CH2), y-axis represents unsaturated
  FA metabolism (d34OA/CH2), and z-axis represents protein synthesis (13C amide I/(13C
  amide I + 12C amide I) ). Shaded areas are error ellipses with 70% confidence. (a)
  Metabolic inhibitor panel from 5 different drugs inhibiting metabolism with control.
  ACS represents acyl CoA synthetase. FASN represents fatty acid synthase. Topo II
  represents topoisomerase II. (b) Specific protein/metabolic pathway inhibitors panel
  includes 4 different drugs targeting specific protein/pathway with control. (c)
  Cell responses to drugs with the same MoAs, including protein synthesis inhibitors,
  DNA intercalation, protein degradation inhibitors and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Experiments
  were repeated 3 times with similar results.
