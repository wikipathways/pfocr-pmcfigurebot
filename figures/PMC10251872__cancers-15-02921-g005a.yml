caption: Colonic mucosal inflammation-related pathways that are down-regulated in
  both sporadic CRC (left panel) and UC CRC (right panel). Cancer tissues (for both
  sporadic CRC and UC CRC) are shown in blue triangles and the normal tissues/control
  are shown in red squares. The genes within the pathways are arranged on the x-axis
  by expression level; gene symbols for all the genes in the pathway could not be
  presented in the figure because of space limitation. Log2-transformed expression
  is shown on the y-axis. A difference of 1 on y-axis represents 2-fold change
