  host immune system.
caption: Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae generates immune evasion by modulating the host
  immune system. Mhp271 can inhibit the GRP78-related signaling pathway, resulting
  in reduced expression of PBD-2. When recognized by Toll-like receptors, Mhp activates
  signaling pathways such as MAPK, inducing excessive inflammatory cytokine expression
  and ultimately leading to associated organ or tissue damage. Moreover, Mhp597 can
  promote the expression of related inflammatory cytokines, which are involved in
  regulating the inflammatory response. Furthermore, Mhp induces incomplete autophagy
  by regulating JNK- and PAK-signaling pathways. Mhp infection leads to apoptosis,
  through a process that involves the expression of ROS, NO, and Caspase-3. Meanwhile,
  the p38 MAPK- and Bax/Bcl-2 signaling pathways are activated
