  BC patients.
caption: EGR1 was downregulated in BC tissues and correlated with prognosis in BC
  patients. (A) mRNA levels of EGR1 in BC and normal breast tissues in the TCGA database.
  (B, C) mRNA levels of EGR1 in cancer tissues and adjacent tissues of BC patients
  (n=50) in Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital. (D, E) Western blot analysis of protein
  expression levels of EGR1 in cancer tissues and adjacent tissues of BC patients
  in Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital. (F, G) Statistical analysis and representative
  images of IHC staining of EGR1 in BC and normal breast tissues from Sun Yat-sen
  Memorial Hospital. The arrow indicates that EGR1 is predominantly located in the
  cell nucleus. (H) The association between EGR1 expression and overall survival in
  BC patients using K-M plotting based on the TCGA database. (I) KEGG pathway analysis
  of the genes significantly associated with the EGR1 expression in BC from R2 database
