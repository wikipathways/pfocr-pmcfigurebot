caption: Activation of the JNK1/2/3 signaling pathway is required for EEPC induced
  Neuro-2a cell differentiation. (A–C) Western blot analysis was used to detect the
  phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2 or p-JNK1/2/3) and total (ERK1/2 or JNK1/2/3) forms of
  different signaling proteins. Neuro-2a cells were pretreated with different inhibitors,
  including ERK inhibitor (FR18024, 10 μM) or JNK inhibitor (SP600125, 10 μM) for
  1 h, followed by EEPC treatment (20 μg/mL) for 48 h. Neurites were visualized by
  an inverted phase contrast microscope (D). Cell differentiation rate (E) and the
  longest length of neurites per differentiated cell (F) were quantified. At least
  300 cells/group were analyzed in each experiment (n = 3), with a one-way ANOVA followed
  by Dunnett’s test. Error bars represent SEM (n = 3). ns, no significant differences;
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, DMSO or inhibitor and EEPC cotreatment vs.
