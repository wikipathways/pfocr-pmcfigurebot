caption: 'TRQ combined with gefitinib inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis
  in NSCLC 3D cell spheres. (A) Cell proliferation was detected after treated with
  gefitinib for 48 h. (B-D) The effect of TRQ alone or in combination with gefitinib
  on proliferation of 3D lung cancer cell spheres. (E) Cell apoptosis rate was detected
  after treated with Gefi (20 μM), TRQ (0.8%) alone or together in 3D cell spheres.
  Data were shown as means ± SD of three independent experiments. #P < 0.05 versus
  the gefitinib alone group, ###P < 0.001. Ctrl, the control group; TRQ, Tanreqing
  injection; Gefi, gefitinib; PC-9-PIK3CA-M, PC-9-PIK3CA-mutation.'
article_title: Tanreqing injection inhibits stemness and enhances sensitivity of non-small
  cell lung cancer models to gefitinib through ROS/STAT3 signaling pathway.
