  in vitro and in vivo.
caption: Anti-inflammatory effects of iMSC-sEV on AMs were mediated by miR-125b-5p
  in vitro and in vivo. (a, b) ELISA examined the level of inflammatory cytokine expression
  and NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS-treated NR8383 cells transfected with miR-125b-5p
  mimics. (c, d) Detection of inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB signaling pathway in
  LPS-treated NR8383 cells with the iMSC-sEV or iMSC-sEV +miR-125b-5p inhibitor. (e)
  Changes in histologic (H&E staining) and CD68 positive macrophage infiltration in
  the lung tissue. (f) Lung injury score of rats in each group. (g) The numbers of
  CD68 positive loci were quantified with ImageJ software. (h) The ELISA analysis
  showed the concentration of intrapulmonary inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α)
  in the BALF. (i) Survival rate of rats in each group within 7 days. The Kaplan–Meier
  method combined with the log-rank test was used to compare multiple populations.
  Compared with the CLP + NC mimic group, αP < 0.01; n = 20 for each group. Data presented
  as mean ± SD.  ∗∗∗P < 0.001,  ∗∗P < 0.01 compared within two groups. n = 6 per group
