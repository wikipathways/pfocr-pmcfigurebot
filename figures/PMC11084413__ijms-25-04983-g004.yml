figure_title: Proteomics analysis of carnosic acid treated HeLa cells.
caption: Proteomics analysis of carnosic acid treated HeLa cells. HeLa cells were
  treated with 25 μg/mL carnosic acid for 24 h. Five replicates were made and were
  compared to the untreated control cells. (A), Volcano plot of the upregulated and
  downregulated proteins in the carnosic acid-treated HeLa cells. (Carnosic acid/control
  fold change ≥1.18 with q-value < 0.05 (red color); carnosic acid/control fold change
  ≤1/1.18 with q-value < 0.05 (grey color)). (B), Functional analysis of the upregulated
  proteins. Graph shows the most significantly altered functional groups/pathways.
  (C), Functional analysis of the downregulated proteins. Graph shows the most significantly
  altered functional groups/pathways. Plot sizes for both the up- and downregulated
  proteins indicate the number of proteins related to a category, and plot color indicates
  the significance (−log10 FDR) of protein enrichment in a category
