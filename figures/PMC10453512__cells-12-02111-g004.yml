figure_title: Effects of HBO on LRP6 phosphorylation, β-catenin translocation, and
  cyclin D1 expression.
caption: Effects of HBO on LRP6 phosphorylation, β-catenin translocation, and cyclin
  D1 expression. (a) HBO significantly decreased Wnt3a protein (* p < 0.05), phosphorylated
  LRP6 (** p < 0.01), and β-catenin protein (** p < 0.01) expressions as compared
  with the control cells. In addition, the suppression of the Wnt3a pathway by HBO
  resulted in a downregulated expression of a Wnt3a target gene, the protein cyclin
  D1 (* p < 0.05). (b) The protein levels of β-catenin in the nuclear fractions were
  downregulated after HBO treatment (** p < 0.01). HBO decreased the translocation
  of β-catenin from the cytosol into the nucleus and demoted the expression of cyclin
  D1
