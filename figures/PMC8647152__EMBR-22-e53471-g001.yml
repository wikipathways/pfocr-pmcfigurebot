figure_title: Icosahedral F‐domain scaffold restores BBB function and enhances angiogenesis
  after injury
caption: 'ABrain tissue from CCI‐TBI animals injected with Evans blue (5% in saline)
  after Sham, Icos1ø (control), or Icos1 (Tie2 super‐agonist) injection at 6, 24,
  48, and 72 h post‐injury was harvested 4 days post‐injury.BEvans Blue epifluorescence
  was imaged in serial sections (30 µm) through the CCI‐TBI lesion to visualize tissue
  penetrance and lesion spread in Icos1ø‐ and Icos1‐treated animals. Scale bar is
  1 mm.CEvans blue extravasation in brain tissue (black dotted circle indicates lesion
  site) was quantified by fluorescence intensity in tissue extracts from hemispheres
  contra‐ and ipsilateral to the injury. Intensity measurement from female and male
  mice was normalized against body mass to report changes in BBB permeability in Icos1ø‐
  and Icos1‐treated animals (P = 0.015, P < 0.0001; n = 6). Scale bar is 1 mm.D, ECCI‐TBI
  brain sections were stained for reactive astrocytes (GFAP, blue), microglia (Iba1,
  green), and serum albumin (magenta) to highlight tissue margins (dotted white line)
  and quantify secondary damage as a function of lesion area (E; *P = 0.04, n = 4,
  the mean ± SEM is plotted ). Bar, 1 mm.FCumulative blood extravasation into brain
  tissue (white outline) was imaged by albumin immunofluorescence to establish an
  unbiased intensity‐threshold mask (red) and quantify the area of blood serum extravasation
  (mm2) in Icos1ø‐ vs. Icos1‐treated animals (**P = 0.01, n = 4, the mean ± SEM is
  plotted). Scale bar is 500 µm.G–IBrain tissues stained by GFAP (magenta) and CD31
  immunofluorescence (green) were imaged by confocal microscopy to measure angiogenesis
  as a function of vessel diameter (H; **P = 0.003, n = 4, the boxes show 25th to
  75th percentiles, and whiskers represent the min and max values.) and quantify the
  number of CD31 vessels (I; **P = 0.007, n = 4, the mean ± SEM is plotted) at the
  site of injury in Icos1ø‐ and Icos1‐treated animals 4 days post‐injury. Scale bars
  in G and H is 100 µm.JActivation of pAKT (Magenta) was examined in Icos1ø‐ and Icos1‐treated
  animals within or around vascular (CD31+, green) and pericytes (NG2+ cells, yellow)
  of the BBB. High‐resolution confocal images (insets) reveal the prevalence of activated
  pAKT (magenta) co‐stain (cyan arrows) in pericytes (yellow) of the BBB along vasculature
  (green, or dotted outline) versus reactive neuroglia (NG2+pAKT−) in the parenchyma
  (red arrows) in Icos1ø‐ vs. Icos1‐treated animals. Scale bar is 10 µm. Data information:
  One‐way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test was used for multiple comparisons, and a t‐test
  was used to compare two groups.'
