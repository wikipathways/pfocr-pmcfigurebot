figure_title: Metabolic pathway and function of HDL.
caption: Metabolic pathway and function of HDL. Adapted from (40). ApoA1 and pre-β
  HDL are the precursor of mature HDL. The liver and kidney are the metabolic site
  of HDL. The function of HDL is to transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues
  to the liver for disposal, to steroidogenic tissues for generation of hormone; HDL,
  high-density lipoprotein; ecto-F1-ATPase, ectopic cell surface F1-ATP synthase;
  SR-B1, scavenger receptor class B type 1; Apo, apolipoprotein; ABCA1, ATP-binding
  cassette transporter A1; EL, endothelial lipase; HL, hepatic lipase; RCT, reverse
  cholesterol transport; CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein; VLDL, very low
  density lipoprotein
