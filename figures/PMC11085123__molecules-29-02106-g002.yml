caption: 'Schematic graph for strategies applied in plant secondary metabolites production
  in plant and microbial chassis. Substrate a undergoes a series of enzyme-catalyzed
  reactions to ultimately yield product j through intermediates bâ€“i. Strategies for
  enhancing the yield of the final product include: 1. Dividing the entire reaction
  pathway into several modules for individual optimization. 2. Eliminating bottlenecks
  in the reaction pathway by overexpressing key enzyme genes. 3. Knocking down or
  knocking out enzyme genes that catalyze intermediate products into other non-target
  substances. 4. Enhancing overall reaction efficiency by adjusting the levels of
  regulators that simultaneously control multiple enzyme genes expression. 5. Dynamically
  controlling enzyme gene expression using inducible promoters to reduce cellular
  burden or toxic side effects. 6. Screening for the optimal combination of enzyme
  genes obtained from different species. 7. Enhancing enzyme activity, stability,
  and adaptability to the host by amino acid site mutagenesis, co-expression of redox
  partners, cofactor engineering, etc. 8. Storing target compounds in specific compartments
  by manipulating transport proteins. 9. Splitting metabolic pathways into several
  parts, expressing them in different cell lines, and then obtaining the final product
  through co-cultivation'
