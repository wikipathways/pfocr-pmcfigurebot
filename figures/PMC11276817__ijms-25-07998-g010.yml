caption: Schematic diagram of the gene network interacting with AdNAC20 during early-bolting
  of ADF. AdNAC20 may be involved in the transcriptional network of lignin biosynthesis
  controlled by auxin and may also regulate lignin and coumarin biosynthesis via the
  phenylpropanoid pathway. SNBE-like indicates that a gene regulates the expression
  of the next gene by recognizing this motif in the promoter. Green arrows represent
  the predicted direct transcriptional regulation of AdNAC20 in this study. Red font
  represents upregulated genes. The blue font represents downregulated genes. The
  pink background represents the lignin biosynthesis pathway. The blue background
  represents the coumarin biosynthetic pathway. AUX, auxin response factors; IAAs,
  indole-3-acetic acid induced proteins; VND4, vascular-related NAC domain protein
  6; VND7, vascular-related NAC domain protein 7; PID, protein kinase PINOID 2-like;
  ARF, auxin response factor; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; CYP73A, trans-cinnamate
  4-monooxygenase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate--CoA ligase; CSE,
  caffeoylshikimate esterase; C3H, coumarale-3-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase;
  CCoAOMT1, caffeoyl-CoA 5-O-methyltransfenase; CAD, cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; REF1, coniferyl-aldehyde dehydrogenase; F5H, ferulate-5-hydroxylase;
  PT, prenyltransferase; PS, psoralen synthase; BMT, bergaptol O-methyltransferase;
  OMT, O-methyl-transferase; CYP82C4, 5-hydroxy-8-methoxypsoralen; C2H, coumarale-2-hydroxylase;
  COSY, coumarin synthase; S8H, scopoletin 8-hydroxylase; HCT, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase.
  (Red font indicates up-regulation of expression, blue font indicates down-regulation
  of expression.)
