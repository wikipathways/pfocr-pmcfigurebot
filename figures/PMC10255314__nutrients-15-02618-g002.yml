figure_title: The metabolic pathway for L-arginine and L-citrulline obtained from
  food sources, urea cycle and NO biosynthesis (A); NO biosynthesis from L-arginine
  by eNOS promotes vasodilation by activating guanylate cyclase to form cGMP that,
  in turn, decreases Ca2+ within smooth muscle cells, diminishing vascular tone and
  leading to vasodilation (B).

  sources, urea cycle and NO biosynthesis (A); NO biosynthesis from L-arginine by
  eNOS promotes vasodilation by activating guanylate cyclase to form cGMP that, in
  turn, decreases Ca2+ within smooth muscle cells, diminishing vascular tone and leading
  to vasodilation (B). eNOS—endothelial nitric oxide synthase, BH4—tetrahydrobiopterin,
  FAD—flavin adenine dinucleotide, FMN—flavin mononucleotide, GC—guanylate cyclase,
  GTP—guanosine triphosphate, cGMP—cyclic guanosine monophosphate, Ca2+—calcium ions
