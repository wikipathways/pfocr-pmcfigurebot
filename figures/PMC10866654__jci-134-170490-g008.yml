figure_title: TGF-β inhibition suppresses CAFs and increases antitumor immunity in
  metastatic CRC tumors
caption: (A) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the TGF-β signaling pathway in
  liver metastasis treated with the indicated therapies compared with control (n =
  4 per group). (B) GSEA of the granzyme-mediated programmed cell death pathway in
  liver metastasis treated with the indicated therapies compared with control (n = 4
  per group). (C) Heatmap showing scaled normalized expression of marker genes in
  iCAFs, myCAFs, and granzymes for killer-cell cytotoxicity, interleukin signaling,
  and T cell activation pathways. (D) A working model showing that TGF-β inhibition
  reduces CAFs to improve antitumor immunity and increase efficacy of ICBs for cancer
  treatment
