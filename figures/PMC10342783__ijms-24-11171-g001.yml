caption: The length distribution of unigenes (a) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) annotation pathway of unigenes (b) for the transcriptome of E. sinensis.
  The vertical coordinate (left) is the name of KEGG secondary metabolic pathway,
  the vertical coordinate (right) is the name of KEGG primary metabolic pathway, and
  the horizontal coordinate is the number of genes annotated to this pathway and their
  proportion to the total number of genes annotated
