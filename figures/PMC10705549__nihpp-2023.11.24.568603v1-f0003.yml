figure_title: Among Omicron-infected patients, different regulation of alternative
  splicing in T and B cell receptor signaling related genes was observed between vaccinated
  and unvaccinated groups
caption: "(A) PCA of exon inclusion levels from 190 samples, as presented in Figure
  1A. The samples are marked differentially based on the vaccination status of Omicron-infected
  patients. Group 1 and 2 represent clusters established through k-means clustering,
  as described in Figure SX. (B) Individual Omicron-infected patients’ vaccination
  status ratio within group 1 and group 2. A chi-squared test was conducted to confirm
  a significant difference in vaccination status proportions between the two groups.
  (C) Volcano plot showing the DASEs between Omicron groups. The x- and y-axis indicate
  inclusion level difference (\U0001D6ABPSI) and negative log10 transformed p-value.
  The q-value indicated corrected p-value. (D) Results of the top 5 terms of GO biological
  process and KEGG pathways enriched with the 1,789 genes from 2964 DASEs (Omi.group1
  vs. Omi.group2). (E) A subset of shared pathways based on 16 common DASEs identified
  in the T cell receptor signaling pathway (hsa04660) and the B cell receptor signaling
  pathway (hsa04662). The coloration of each gene box signifies the expression difference
  between the two groups, with solid lines indicating a direct effect and dashed lines
  representing an indirect effect. (F) Significant differential spliced events of
  KRAS (chr12:25,205,246–25,250,929) and NFATC2 (chr20:51,386,963–51,542,719) showing
  two MXE events, respectively. Inclusion levels represent the usage of spliced exons.
  The error bar indicates standard deviation of the mean"
