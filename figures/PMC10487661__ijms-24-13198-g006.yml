caption: DEGs involved in the flavonoids and chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. (A)
  DEGs involved in the flavonoids biosynthetic pathway; (B) DEGs involved in the chlorophyll
  biosynthetic pathway. Heat maps were created based on average expression levels
  (FPKM values). The color scale represents the FPKM value. Red indicates high expression,
  and green indicates low expression. BT is ‘Baitang’ (purple pericarp), JX is ‘Jinxuan’
  (green pericarp), ZB is ‘Zhongbaiyihao’ (white pericarp). PAL, Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H, Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoAligase; HCT, Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA
  shikimate/quinatehydroxy-cinnamoyltransferase; CCR, Cinnamoyl Co-A reductase; CoAOMT,
  Caffeoyl coenzyme A O-methyltransferase; CHS, Chalcone synthase; CHI, Chalcone isomerase;
  FLS, Flavonol synthase; F3’H, Flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3’5’H, Flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase;
  DFR, Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; LAR, Leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANS, Anthocyanidin
  synthase; HEMA, Glutamyl-tRNA reductase; HEML, glutamate 1-semialdehyde aminotransferase;
  HEMB, porphobilinogen synthase; HEME, Uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase; GUN5,
