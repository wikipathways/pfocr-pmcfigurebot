caption: Cisplatin as an upstream regulator in gastric adenocarcinoma. (a) The upstream
  regulator analysis of cisplatin in the activity plot revealed 64,880 analyses for
  cisplatin. (b) Cisplatin was identified as an activated upstream regulator in pembrolizumab,
  a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)-treated
  gastric adenocarcinoma in progressive disease. (c) The tumor microenvironment pathway
  was activated in the pembrolizumab-treated gastric adenocarcinoma
