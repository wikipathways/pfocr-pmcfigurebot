figure_title: Effect of AND (5 µM), DEX (50 µM) or AND (5 µM) + DEX (50 µM) on the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and GR expression after knockdown of the autophagy-related
  gene, LC3.
caption: 'Effect of AND (5 µM), DEX (50 µM) or AND (5 µM) + DEX (50 µM) on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway, and GR expression after knockdown of the autophagy-related gene,
  LC3. (A) Western blot images of proteins from the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway
  after drug treatment of CEM-C1 cells. The mean ratio of (B) p-PI3K/PI3K, (C) p-AKT/AKT
  and (D) p-mTOR/mTOR following the densitometric semi-quantification of bands. (E)
  Transfection efficiency of the PC was determined by western blotting. (F) Transfection
  efficiency of si-LC3 was determined by western blotting, followed by the (G) semi-quantitation
  of the ratio of LC3II to LC3I. (H) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used
  to detect GR mRNA expression following knockdown of LC3. GAPDH was used as the internal
  reference. (I) Western blot images and (J) semi-quantification of GR protein expression
  following knockdown of LC3. n=3. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. control; #P<0.05
  vs. DEX only; &&P<0.01, &&&P<0.001 vs. NC. AND, andrographolide; DEX, dexamethasone;
  GR, glucocorticoid receptor; LC3, microtubule-associated 1 protein light chain 3;
  NC, negative control; p-, phosphorylated; PC, positive control; si, small interfering
  RNA'
