figure_title: The effects of RSV on the regulation of microRNAs and BMP2 signalling
  in protecting bone.
caption: 'The effects of RSV on the regulation of microRNAs and BMP2 signalling in
  protecting bone. The interaction of specific microRNAs and BMP2 results in the downregulation
  of Nox4/NF-B pathway activity and upregulation of SMAD/RUNX2 protein to promote
  osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and calcium deposition. Abbreviation:
  miR: microRNA; BMP2: bone morphogenetic protein 2; SMAD: Suppressor of mothers against
  decapentaplegic. Nox4: NADPH Oxidase 4; NF-κB: Nuclear factor-κB; ALP: Alkaline
  phosphatase; RUNX2: runt-related transcription factor; OPG: osteoprotegerin'
