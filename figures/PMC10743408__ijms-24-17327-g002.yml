caption: Top IPA-identified canonical pathways of genes differentially expressed from
  CAR of heifers supplemented a vitamin–mineral mix containing 35 ppm as ISe (n =
  6) or 1:1 mixture of ISe:OSe (MIX, n = 6). Pathways are ranked by z-score, with
  orange indicating a pathway that is predicted to be upregulated (positive z-score)
  and the blue indicating a pathway that is predicted to be downregulated (negative
  z-score)
