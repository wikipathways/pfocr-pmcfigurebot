  miR−618 invovles in the PI3K−Akt signaling pathway. (A) The Venn diagram shows the overlapping signaling pathways enriched by miR−618 and signaling pathways enriched by target genes of miR–618. (B,C) WB assay was performed to detect the protein expression levels of PI3K, P–PI3K, AKT, and P–AKT in the PI3K–Akt pathway in keratinocytes transfected with miR–618 mimic and NC. Image J 1.53 analyzed the bands’ grayscale values and counted the target proteins’ relative expression levels, using Tublin as the internal reference protein. (D,E) WB was performed to detect the protein expression levels of PI3K, P–PI3K, AKT, and P–AKT in the PI3K–Akt pathway in keratinocytes transfected with miR–618 inhibitor and NC. Image J 1.53 analyzed the bands’ grayscale values and counted the target proteins’ relative expression levels, using Tublin as the internal reference protein. (F) FISH assay to detect the expression level of miR–618 in keratinocytes using FISH probes. Red represents miR–618; blue represents DAPI. Scale: 20 µm. (G) Gray FISH values for miR–618 and DAPI in keratinocytes. Red represents miR–618; blue represents DAPI. (H) Diagram of LY294002 (inhibitor of PI3K) treating keratinocytes. (I) FISH assay to detect the expression level of miR–618 with treated by LY294002. Red represents miR–618; blue represents DAPI. Scale: 20 µm. (J) Gray FISH values for miR–618 and DAPI in keratinocytes treated with LY294002. Red represents miR–618; blue represents DAPI. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. ns
