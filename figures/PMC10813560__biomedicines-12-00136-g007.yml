caption: (A) Heatmaps were generated to visualise the notable pathways identified
  as significant by DIANA-miRPath (v.3.0) for the shared to common miRNA signature
  for the two subtypes of PTC. These heatmaps utilised clustering to arrange the pathways
  based on their significantly levels, with paths displayed along the x-axis and miRNAs
  along the y-axis. A colour code was applied to indicate the logarithmic (log) values
  of p-values. The most relevant interactions between predicted miRNAs and pathways
  were highlighted in red, (B) a graphical representation of the main target related
  to TP53 signalling for the selected miRNA panel
