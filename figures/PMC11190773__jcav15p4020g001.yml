figure_title: MMPs genetic variation and expression landscape in EC.
caption: MMPs genetic variation and expression landscape in EC. (A) The CNV variation
  frequency of MMPs from TCGA-UCEC and UCEC-US cohort. The height of the column represents
  the alteration frequency. The deletion frequency, green dot; The amplification frequency,
  red dot. (B) The location of CNV alteration of MMPs on 23 chromosomes using TCGA-UCEC.
  The deletion frequency, blue dot; The amplification frequency, red dot. (C) Expression
  heat map of the 11 MMPs in normal and EC samples in TCGA-UCEC cohort. Tumour, red;
  Normal, blue. (D) The interaction of expression on 11 MMPs in EC. (E) The Pearson
  correlation among 11 MMPs. The positive correlation is marked with red, and negative
  correlation is marked with blue. The size of circle represents the absolute value
  of correlation coefficients. (F) Consensus matrices of the significant MMPs for
  k = 2. (G) Principal component analysis for the transcriptome profiles of MMP expression
  patterns, showing a remarkable difference in the transcriptome between different
  expression patterns. (H) Survival difference among two MMP expression patterns (P
  = 0.020, Kruskal-Wallis test). MMP cluster-A, yellow; MMP cluster-B, blue. (I) Unsupervised
  clustering of 11 MMP regulators in the TCGA-UCEC cohort identified a significant
  difference in the expression of regulators among the two expression patterns. The
  MMP clusters, TCGA project, age, sex, clinical stage, and survival status were used
  as patient annotations. Red, high expression of regulators; blue, low expression
  of regulators. (J) Differences of 11 MMPs gene expression between MMP cluster A
  and MMP cluster B. MMP cluster-A, blue; MMP cluster-B, yellow, the upper and lower
  ends of the boxes represent the interquartile range of values. The lines in the
  boxes represent the median value, and black dots showed outliers. The asterisks
  represented the statistical P value (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). (K) The
  biological behaviour between these different MMPs expression patterns were analysed
  by KEEG enrichment using TCGA-UCEC and UCEC-US cohort; red represents activated
  pathways and blue represents inhibited pathways. (L) GO analysis showing the Cellular
  Component, Molecular Function and distinct biological processes in in distinct MMP
  cluster expression patterns using TCGA-UCEC and UCEC-US cohort. The heatmap was
  used to visualize these biological processes, and red represents activated pathways
  and blue represents inhibited pathways. MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; EC, endometrial
