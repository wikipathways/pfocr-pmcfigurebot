figure_title: iPASnFR detects drug-induced changes in cytosolic PA levels and demonstrates
  synergistic effects of inhibiting PA synthesis and uptake
caption: '(A) Structural cartoon of iPASnFR-mScarlet3 (gray: binding protein; light
  green: cpsfVenus; red: mScarlet3). (B) Cytosolically expressed iPASnFR-H/L in HEK293
  cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. The ratio of iPASnFR to mScarlet3 in individual cells
  was quantified and averaged in each replicate, covering ~500 cells. Seven replicates
  from 2 independent experiments are shown. The mean ratios were normalized to the
  average of those of iPASnFR-L. (C) Schematic of PA biosynthetic pathway. ODC: ornithine
  decarboxylase; SRM: spermidine synthase; SMS: spermine synthase; AdoMetDC: S-adenosylmethionine
  decarboxylase; dcAdoMet: decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine; MTA: methylthioadenosine.
  AMXT-1501 and DFMO are PA analogs that competitively inhibit PA transporters and
  ODC, respectively. (D) Measurement of mean iPASnFR-L:mScarlet3 fluorescence ratio
  in HEK293 cells treated with AMXT-1501 and DFMO either individually or in combination.
  A total of 9-15 replicates from 2-3 independent experiments is shown for each condition.
  We used the indicated drug concentrations, to which iPASnFR-L is not sensitive (DFMO,
  ΔF/F0: −0.069 ± 0.020 at 1 mM; AMXT-1501, ΔF/F0: 0.049 ± 0.0080 at 100 nM) (Supp.
  Fig. 6). The mean fluorescence ratios were normalized to control (no drug addition)
  in each experiment. Single-sample t-tests were performed to compare mean fluorescence
  ratios of drug-treated groups to non-treated (gray). Comparisons between groups
  were made using 2-tailed unpaired t-tests (black). (E) Metabolomics analysis of
  total cellular PAs (SPM, SPD, and PUT) in HEK293 cells treated with DFMO and AMXT-1501
  either alone or in combination. Two-tailed unpaired t-tests were performed for pairwise
  analyses. When P > 0.05, individual P-values were shown above comparison bars. No
  significant differences were observed unless noted'
