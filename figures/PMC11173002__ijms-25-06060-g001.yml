figure_title: Development of the CB1R biosensor.
caption: 'Development of the CB1R biosensor. (a) The yeast pheromone response pathway
  was genetically modified for human receptors. Grayed out boxes represent knocked
  out genes. The yeast pheromone GPCR Ste2 was replaced with a human GPCR (illustrated
  as a red 7-transmembrane protein). The Fig1 pheromone response gene was replaced
  with a ZsGreen reporter via knock-in. The GpaI G-alpha protein is illustrated in
  two colors to represent its chimeric nature, where the yeast portion (purple) interacts
  with the factors of the MAP kinase cascade and the humanized C-terminus (red) interacts
  with the human GPCR directly. (b) ACEA dose response with CB1R. CB1, EC50 = 1.30
  µM, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.12 µM. Δ89-CB1R, EC50 5.05 µM, 95% CI 2.64 to 9.29 µM. Syn-pre-pro
  CB1R EC50 = 0.04 µM, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.05 µM. Syn-pre-pro Δ89-CB1R, EC50 = 0.15 µM,
  95% CI 0.10 to 0.21 µM. (c) Dose response of the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoyl
  glycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA) with CB1R. AEA,
  EC50: 4 nM, 95% CI 2.62 × 10−9 to 6.92 × 10−9 M 2-AG,EC50: 100 nM, 95% CI 6.60 ×
  10−8 to 1.48 × 10−7 M. For all experiments, n = 3. Nonlinear regression was fit
  as a 4-parameter logistic equation. (d) Cytometry of yeast treated with 1 uM AEA
  or DMSO vehicle (1% v/v). The yeast was treated with ligands or vehicles for 8 h,
  and ZsGreen fluorescence was measured on gated singlets. Syn-pre-pro-Δ89CB1R (n
  = 4), WT CB1R (n = 4), 5HT1AR (n = 3), and the base GPCR strain with no receptor
  (n = 4) were tested. (e) Mean fluorescence values from (d) for the AEA and vehicle
  group were plotted. Unpaired t-tests were performed between the negative control
  and test groups. p-values are reported where ns corresponds to p > 0.05, * is p
  ≤ 0.05, and *** is p ≤ 0.001'
