  ATP/IL-33 co-sensing.
caption: SCF supports the cytokine production but not degranulation induced by ATP/IL-33
  co-sensing. (a) The IL-33-induced cytokine production [40]. IL-33 induces a TAK1-dependent
  activation of p65/RelA which results in the production of IL-2, IL-6 and GMCSF.
  Thereby, IL-33 is not able to induce MC degranulation. (b) The ATP-induced cytokine
  production [14]. ATP induces a Ca2+-dependent activation of the CaN-NFAT module.
  This results in the production of IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13 and MC degranulation. (c)
  Co-sensing of ATP and IL-33 [14]. IL-33 activates the TAK1-p65/RelA signaling pathway.
  Activated TAK1 is then targeted by ATP-activated CaN which prolongs the TAK1 activity
  and thus the activity of p65/RelA [14]. The combination of enhanced p65/RelA activity
  and the activity of NFAT potentiated the production of IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13 and
  GMCSF [14]. Thereby, the ATP-induced MC degranulation remained unchanged [14]. (d)
  Co-sensing of ATP and IL-33 in the presence of SCF. IL-33 activates the TAK1-p65/RelA
  signaling pathway. Activated TAK1 is then targeted by ATP-activated CaN, which prolongs
  the TAK1 activity and the activity of p65/RelA [14]. The additional presence of
  SCF activates STATs. We speculate that activated STATs interact with and further
  enhance the activity of p65/RelA which is induced by ATP/IL-33 co-sensing. Thereby,
  the ATP-induced MC degranulation remains unchanged. (Figures were created with Biorender)
