figure_title: The overexpression of CtFLS1 induced flavonoid biosynthesis pathway
  in Arabidopsis.
caption: 'The overexpression of CtFLS1 induced flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis.
  (A) The expression pattern of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes in the transgenic
  Arabidopsis lines. (B) Leaves of wild-type and CtFLS1 transgenic Arabidopsis lines
  were used to detect flavonol content using DPBA staining. Bars = 25 Î¼m. (C) Total
  flavonoids content in wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis leaves. (D) Total anthocyanin
  content in wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis leaves. FW, fresh weight. Significance
  analysis t test: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01'
