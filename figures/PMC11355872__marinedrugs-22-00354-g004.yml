figure_title: HSN-S1 inhibits MAPK pathway activation in LPS-challenged RAW264.
caption: HSN-S1 inhibits MAPK pathway activation in LPS-challenged RAW264.7 cells.
  Cells were pretreated with HSN-S1 for 1 h, then exposed to LPS 1 μg/mL to mimic
  an inflammation environment. Protein expression was quantified 1 h post-LPS exposure.
  Panel (A) displays the Western blot results. Panels (B,C) quantify the ratio of
  phosphorylated to total ERK (p-ERK/ERK) and p38 (p-p38/p38), respectively. Results,
  represented as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments, demonstrated a significant
  reduction in MAPK pathway activation by HSN-S1 (### p < 0.001 vs. control; *** p
  < 0.001 vs. LPS group). Dexamethasone (Dexa; 1 μM) served as a standard anti-inflammatory
  compound for comparison
