figure_title: The expression of PLAUR was increased in ccRCC tissues and cell lines
caption: (A) The relative protein level of PLAUR in 20 pairs of ccRCC tissues and
  the adjacent tissues was examined by IHC; IOD/area ratio of the indicated IHC images
  results confirmed that PLAUR level was upregulated in ccRCC tissues. qRT-PCR was
  used to detect the relative mRNA expression of PLAUR in 20 pairs of ccRCC tissues
  and the adjacent tissues (B) and human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 and 4 ccRCC
  cells (C). (D) Western blot was used to detect the expression of PLAUR protein in
  human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 and 4 ccRCC cells. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01,
  *** P < 0.001.
