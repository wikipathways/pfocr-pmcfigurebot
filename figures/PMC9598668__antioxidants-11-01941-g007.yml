caption: Protective effect of CRHF2 on PM-induced damage in zebrafish. (a) ROS production,
  (b) cell death, and (c) lipid peroxidation. Experiments were triplicated (n = 3).
  Results are represented as mean ± SD; ** p < 0.01. (# denotes significance compared
  to control while * represents significance compared to PM-treated group).
