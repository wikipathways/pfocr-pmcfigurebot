caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of biosynthesis and transportation of allantoin
  under oxidative stress conditions. Disturbance in the normal cellular metabolism
  of plants due to abiotic stress conditions provokes the over-accumulation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress, which is detrimental to vital
  cellular components. In order to overcome stress responses, plants have developed
  defensive mechanisms through alterations in the purine catabolism pathway. (A: epidermis;
  B: cortex; C: endodermis; D: pericycle; E: vascular bundle; AMP: adenosine monophosphate;
  ALN: allantoinase; ALNS: allantoin synthase; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; GMP: guanosine
  monophospahte; IMP: inosine monophospahte; UO: uricase; XDH: xanthine dehydrogenase)'
