caption: 'Gene Set Enrichment Analysis: (a, b) heatmaps depict the 30 DEGs between
  the IFNG high and low groups in AS and IBD. Red indicates that the expression of
  genes is upregulated, and blue indicates that the expression of genes downregulated;
  (c) the signaling pathways enrich in the IFNG high expression groups in AS; (d)
  the signaling pathways enrich in IFNG low expression groups in AS; (e) the signaling
  pathways enrich in IFNG high expression groups in IBD; (f) the signaling pathways
  enrich in IFNG low expression groups in IBD'
