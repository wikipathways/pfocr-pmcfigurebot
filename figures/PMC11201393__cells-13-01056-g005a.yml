caption: Differential expression of gene pathways in BCC (in blue) compared to healthy
  skin tissue (in red) by PTCH1 mutational status. BCC tissues with no non-synonymous
  somatic mutations in PTCH1 are shown on the left panel and those with mutations
  are shown on the right panel. Genes are arranged on the x-axis by expression level,
  and the log2-transformed gene count per million (CPM) is shown on the y-axis. Gene
  symbols for all the genes could not be shown on the x-axis
