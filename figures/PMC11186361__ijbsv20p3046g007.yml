caption: The synergistic effects of Lenvatinib with SAHA or AZD5363 were validated
  in HCC organoid models. (A) Dose-response curve of HCC organoids treated with Lenvatinib.
  (B) Average IC50 values generated from dose-response curves from (A). (C) Western
  blotting analysis of the expression of total AKT and p-AKT in HCC organoids. (D)
  Synergy map of HCC organoids treated with the combination of Lenvatinib and SAHA
  or AZD5363. (E) Schematic models of the mechanism underlying SAHA or AKT inhibitor
  reverses Lenvatinib resistance in HCC. Lenvatinib mainly reduced the MAPK pathway
  signaling while activation of the AKT pathway allows cells to continue to proliferate
  and survive independent of MAPK signaling, blocking AKT signaling pathway by either
  HDACi or AKT inhibitor resensitized Lenvatinib resistant HCC to Lenvatinib treatment
