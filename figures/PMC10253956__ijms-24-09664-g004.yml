figure_title: ZEA and DON inhibited the LTA-induced TLR2/NFκB signaling pathway in
  BRL 3A cells.
caption: 'ZEA and DON inhibited the LTA-induced TLR2/NFκB signaling pathway in BRL
  3A cells. (A,B) The gene and protein expression of TLR2 and MyD88 was detected via
  qPCR and Western blotting. (C) Protein expression and phosphitylation levels of
  TRAF6, p-TAK1, p-IκBα/IκBα, and p-NFκB/NFκB were analyzed via western blotting.
  Values are the mean ± SD of three individual experiments. ## p  <  0.01, indicate
  significant differences between LTA groups and control groups; * p < 0.05 and **
  p < 0.01, indicate significant differences between toxin treated groups and LTA
  groups (D) Fluorescence microscopy images indicate that NFκB nuclear translocation
  occurred. NFκB (green), DAPI (blue), scale bar = 50 µm'
