caption: A hypothetical model for control of organic acid (citrate) exudation in roots
  against Al ion (Al3+) toxicity. At the nuclear level, activation of SENSITIVE TO
  PROTON RHIXOTOXICITY 1 (STOP1) initiates the signaling pathway, which otherwise
  activates multidrug and toxic compound extrusion 1, Arabidopsis thaliana aluminum
  activated malate transporter 1, and amylotrophic lateral sclerosis 3 (AIMTE, MATE,
  ALS3) genes. STOP1 also upregulates the expression of RNA export 1 (RAE1), which,
  in feedback regulation, reduces STOP1 through degradation and ubiquitination. Signal
  transduction and activation of RNA 1 and 2 (STAR1, STAR2) otherwise induce UDP glucose-like
  residues, which conjugate with Al for extracellular detoxification. Transcription
  factors like Oryza sativa wrinkled transcription factor (OsWRKY22) form dimers with
  ADP-ribosyltransferase 1 (ART1) and collectively induce citrate biosynthesizing
  genes. Expressed proteins from the Nramp family (Nrat1) on the cellular membrane
  engulf Al3+ within the apoplastic space for chelation
