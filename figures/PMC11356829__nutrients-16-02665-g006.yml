caption: NAMPT is obviously upregulated during DCs activation in psoriasis. (A) GSEA
  analysis of DCs pathway in skin samples from psoriasis patients and healthy controls
  from the GEO dataset (GSE121212). (B) GSEA analysis of NAM salvage pathway in skin
  samples from psoriasis patients and healthy controls from the GEO dataset (GSE121212).
  (C) GSEA analysis of NF-κB signaling pathway between NAMPT high- and low-level groups
  in clinical samples from the GEO dataset (GSE121212). (D) Correlation heatmap of
  NAM salvage pathway-related genes with the infiltration levels of various immune
  cell types in the skin of psoriasis patients and healthy controls from the GEO dataset
  (GSE121212). (E) GSEA analysis of DCs function-related gene sets in skin samples
  from psoriasis patients and healthy controls from the GEO dataset (GSE121212)
