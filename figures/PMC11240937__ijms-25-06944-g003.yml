figure_title: Seed phenotype analysis of T3 EDD1 mutants.
caption: 'Seed phenotype analysis of T3 EDD1 mutants. (A) Total FAMEs per mg seeds.
  (B) Seed weight. (C) Seed fatty acid content. (D) Fatty acid content of each of
  the three different types: saturated fatty acid (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acid
  (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). (E) Biosynthetic pathway of TAG (triacylglycerol)
  from DAG (diacylglycerol) and C16:0 to C22:1 fatty acids by CsDGAT1. This indicates
  that CsDGAT1 prefers DAGs with MUFAs and MUFAs such as C18:1 and C20:1 as the acyl
  substrates, resulting in the biosynthesis of TAGs with a high MUFA content. In (C),
  minor fatty acids such as C20:0 and C20:2 were omitted. All experiments were performed
  in triplicate, and the error bar is the standard error. The values were statistically
  analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeyâ€™s test (p < 0.05). Lowercase letters
  above the bars indicate the results of a one-way ANOVA statistical test'
