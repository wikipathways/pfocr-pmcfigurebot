figure_title: RB1 KO enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of PARPi in LUAD xenograft
caption: '(A) Tumor volumes of 4 treatment groups with A549-RB1-WT (100 μL PBS), A549-RB1-KO
  (100 μL PBS), A549-RB1-WT + rucaparib (60 μL DMSO, 240 μL PEG 300, 30 μL Tween 80,
  270 μL normal saline, 1.08 mg rucaparib every 2 days) and A549-RB1-KO + rucaparib
  (60 μL DMSO, 240 μL PEG 300, 30 μL Tween 80, 270 μL normal saline, 1.08 mg rucaparib
  every 2 days). (B) The tumor growth curves of 4 treatment groups for 30 days. **P
  < 0.01. (C) Representative images of IHC staining in LUAD xenograft samples. Scale
  bars: 50 μm. (D) Western blot analysis of proteins in the STING pathway in LUAD
  xenograft samples (n = 3). (E and F) qRT-PCR analysis of CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNAs in
  A549-RB1-WT and A549-RB1-KO cells after treatment with PARPis in mice (n = 5). *P
  < 0.05 vs. A549-RB1-WT + rucaparib. P values in D–F were calculated by unpaired,
  2-tailed Student’s t test'
