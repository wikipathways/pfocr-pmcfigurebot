caption: HSN-S1 prevents NFATc2 nuclear translocation in activated Jurkat T cells.
  The capability of HSN-S1 to inhibit NFATc2 nuclear translocation, a pivotal event
  in T-cell activation, using Jurkat cells as a model system is shown. Cells were
  pre-treated with HSN-S1, followed by 10 μg/mL of ConA stimulation, a condition that
  activates the NFATc2 signaling pathway. (A) One hour after the ConA administration,
  NFATc2 nuclear migration was analyzed. The analysis, focused within a red-boxed
  region of interest (ROI) marked by a red arrow, quantitatively evaluated NFATc2
  localization. (B) The effect of HSN-S1 on NFAT pathway engagement was examined using
  Jurkat Lucia™ NFAT cells that express luciferase in response to NFAT activation.
  The Jurkat Lucia™ NFAT cells were treated with the sample, followed by the administration
  of 10 μg/mL ConA. The analysis was conducted after a 20 h response period. Results,
  depicted as mean ± SEM from six independent experiments, revealed significant suppression
  of NFAT-driven luciferase expression by HSN-S1 (### p < 0.001 vs. control; *** p
  < 0.001 vs. ConA group). FK506 (1 ng/mL) was used as a reference anti-inflammatory
  agent
