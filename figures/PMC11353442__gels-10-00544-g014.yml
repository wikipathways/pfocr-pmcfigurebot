caption: Alcohol-induced ONFH. Regular alcohol use causes apoptosis of the femoral
  head mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) that decreases the osteogenic differentiation
  of stem cells. This decrease causes subchondral fractures and necrotic lesions in
  the femoral head. A regular alcohol intake is also known to activate the peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) pathway, which is the key regulatory
  pathway in adipogenesis. The activation of this pathway induces lipid accumulation
  in the femoral head. Accumulated lipids cause an increase in pressure in the bone
  marrow cavity that suppresses the vasculature and blocks or impairs the blood circulation.
  This inadequate blood circulation causes osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH)
