caption: Regulatory mechanisms of WNP + GSE in the BDNF signaling pathway in PC12
  cells. (A) BDNF levels in PC12 cells. (B) P−TrkB/TrkB levels in PC12 cells. (C)
  P−CREB/CREB levels in PC12 cells. (D) Trx−1 levels in PC12 cells. Data are expressed
  as means ± standard deviation; all experiments were repeated three times; N = 3.
