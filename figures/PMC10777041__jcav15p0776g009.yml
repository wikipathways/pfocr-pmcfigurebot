figure_title: Characterization of G protein-coupled receptors in single cells.
caption: 'Characterization of G protein-coupled receptors in single cells. A: CCL20,
  DDIT4, GPX3, BEX5, AKAP12, DSG2, SERPINH1, LDHA were analyzed by single cell RNA-seq,
  DNAJB4 and DOCK4 expression in different cell types. B: Violin plots of CCL20, DDIT4,
  GPX3, BEX5, AKAP12, DSG2, SERPINH1, LDHA, DNAJB4, and DOCK4 genes demonstrating.
  C: Quantitative intercellular communication; D: Intense intercellular communication.
  E-F: Circos plots showing APP (H), CXCL (I), and MHC-II (J) signaling pathway networks;
  H-J: heatmaps showing the roles played by different cell types in the pathway networks'
