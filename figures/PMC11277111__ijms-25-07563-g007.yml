caption: (A) Virus-mediated expression of bioluminescent optogenetic systems (LMO3
  or iLMO) modulates neuronal firing rates in vivo, inducing increases (left) or decreases
  (right) upon the addition of coelenterazine (CTZ) (** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001
  (two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc test)) [131]. Copyright 2016, K. Berglund et
  al. (B) Schematic representation of in situ bioluminescence-driven optogenetic therapy
  of retinoblastoma based on camouflage nanoparticles (top). The delivery of optogenetic
  plasmids results in the expression of FAS-CIB1-EGFP-CAAX in the plasma membrane
  and the expression of CRY2-mCherry-FADD in the cytoplasm. Blue bioluminescence induces
  the binding of the blue light receptor proteins CIB1 and CRY2, and the subsequent
  binding of FADD to FAS activates the caspase-3 apoptotic signaling pathway. In vivo
  evaluation of camouflage nanoparticle-based optogenetic system demonstrated more
  significant tumor cell apoptosis upon addition of Nano-Glo (furimazine) than in
  other groups [141]. Red arrows indicate regions of tumor cell apoptosis. Scale bars,
