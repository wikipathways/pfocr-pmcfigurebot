caption: The mechanisms of the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate
  metabolism pathways. The key differential metabolites associated with mastitis are
  circled in red. (a) The mechanisms of the citrate cycle (TCA cycle) pathway (bta00020).
  (b) The mechanisms of the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathway (bta00630).
