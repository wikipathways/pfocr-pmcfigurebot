caption: Differentially expressed gene pathways in UC (in blue triangles) compared
  to Control (in red squares). The genes are arranged on the x-axis by expression
  level and the log2-transformed expression in counts-per-million-aligned reads is
  shown on the y-axis. Gene symbols for all the genes in a given pathway could not
  be presented in the figure because of space limitation. A difference of 1 on the
  y-axis represents 2-fold change
