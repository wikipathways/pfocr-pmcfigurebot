figure_title: Major pathways of carbon and energy metabolism in M382.
caption: Major pathways of carbon and energy metabolism in M382. Protein sequences
  were predicted from the complete genome of M382 and annotated using the KEGG database.
  Metabolic pathway reconstruction based on the KEGG-annotated proteins was performed
  using KEGG Mapper. The dashed lines represent simplified pathways
