caption: 'IPA Core analysis of the Epithelial Adherens Junctions Signaling in SW480
  AHCY deficient cells with increased expression of LEF1 protein. The accompanying
  Table 5 provides valuable insights into the transcriptional alterations observed
  in pivotal genes associated with epithelial adherens junctions signaling following
  differential expression analysis such as: CDH1, CDH2, TCF/LEF1. Notably, there are
  changes in gene expression observed in the TCF/LEF complex, mirroring the patterns
  seen in the Wnt signaling pathway and the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition pathway'
