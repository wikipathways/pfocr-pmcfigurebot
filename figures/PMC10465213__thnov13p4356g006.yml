figure_title: TRPM2 regulates cisplatin-induced autophagy in kidneys via suppressing
  the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.
caption: TRPM2 regulates cisplatin-induced autophagy in kidneys via suppressing the
  AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. (A) PCA analysis on the RNA-sequencing data from cisplatin
  (CP)-treated Trpm2-/- and WT mice (n = 3). (B, C) Heatmap and volcano plot of differentially
  expressed genes (|log2(FoldChange)| > 1, P value < 0.05). (D) Top 10 upregulated
  and downregulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichments. ARVC,
  Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. (E)
  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway generated from Trpm2-/- and
  WT mice subjected to cisplatin. (F) Immunoblotting analysis and quantification of
  p-mTOR, mTOR, p-AKT, AKT in the kidneys of Trpm2-/- and WT mice. (G) Immunoblotting
  analysis and quantification of LC3B II in the kidneys of CP-treated mice. The mice
  were either injected i.p. with 1 mg/kg rapamycin (Rapa) or vehicle 1 hour prior
  to and 1 day after CP treatment. (H) Immunoblotting analysis and quantification
  of LC3B II in the kidneys of CP-treated mice. The mice were injected i.p. with either
  50 mg/kg VIII or vehicle 1 h prior to cisplatin injection. (I) Formation of autolysosomes
  evaluated by immunofluorescence double-labeled LC3B and LAMP1. Scale bars, 25 μm.
  Formation of mitolysosomes evaluated by immunofluorescence double-labeled TOM20
  and LAMP1. Scale bars, 20 μm. Quantification of (J) autolysosomes and (K) mitolysosomes
  in the renal tubules (n = 6). Data are presented as mean±SEM. Statistical analysis
  was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001
