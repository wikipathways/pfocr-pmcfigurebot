figure_title: CD47-SIRPα signaling-inspired engineered monocytes for preventing the
  progression of atherosclerotic plaques
caption: 'A novel immune cell therapy system based on the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway
  was developed for precise treatment of atherosclerotic plaques: by activating and
  terminating CD47-SIRPα binding, the engineered monocytes have dual functions of
  inhibiting lipoprotein phagocytosis and reversing the proinflammatory microenvironment,
  demonstrating potential for cell therapy in cardiovascular diseases'
