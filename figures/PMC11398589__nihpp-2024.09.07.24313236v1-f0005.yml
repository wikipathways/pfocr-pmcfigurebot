figure_title: Relationships among exercise- and insulin sensitivity-related gene sets
caption: Gene transcriptome candidates derived from Figure 1, steps A, B, and C are
  represented as discs in green, purple, and red respectively. Thirteen transcripts
  or those involved in a synthesis pathway (i.e., for beta-estradiol or tetradecanoylphorbol
  acetate) in common were identified. The designations are listed to the right
