figure_title: Sensitivity indices (p < 0.
caption: 'Sensitivity indices (p < 0.05) of parameters controlling the ECPI under
  hypoxic conditions for the stimulated and the unstimulated cell at different time
  points. The colors indicate respective pathways related to the parameters, and cell
  type is indicated by a dashed (stimulated cell) or non-dashed (unstimulated cell)
  pattern. (A) PRCC values for the top 10 most relevant parameters which influence
  pattern in at least one of the cells, compared to the same parameter on the other
  cell at 1h and 2h under hypoxia. Twenty most influential reactions (top 10 + and
  top 10 −) that influence ECPI of the stimulated cell (B) or the unstimulated cell
  (C) at 1h or 2h under hypoxia. kdeg_Gs: degradation rate of γsecretase. Kf_10: Internalization
  rate of VEGFR2. Kform_Gs: production rate of γsecretase. kf_5: Degradation rate
  of internalized phosphorylated VEGFR2. kNRP1VEGFR2on/off: Binding/unbinding rate
  of complex VEGF-NRP1 to VEGFR2. kr_4: Recycling rate of internalized VEGFR2. kf_9:
  Degradation rate of internalized VEGFR2. kr2NRP1si: Internalization rate of complex
  VEGF-NRP1-VEGFR2. n: Hill coefficient for Hes1 inhibition of VEGFR2'
