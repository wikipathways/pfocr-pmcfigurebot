figure_title: HSP90 interacts with VP7 and STAT3 on the cellular membrane to promote
  GCRV entry
caption: '(A) Recombinant protein VP5-HIS-EGFP and VP7-HIS-EGFP were purified using
  standard nickel-column affinity protocol to homogeneity and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
  (B) Purified recombinant protein coupled with Ni beads was examined by optical microscopy
  analysis. (C) GCO cells were incubated with the purified recombinant protein VP5-HIS-EGFP
  /VP7-HIS-EGFP, and the binding between VP5/VP7 and GCO cells was analyzed by optical
  microscopy analysis. The empty vector was handled as a control. Scale bars denote
  5 μm. (D) CIK cells were prepared for subcellular fractionation followed by pulldown
  analysis with purified his-tagged VP7/VP5. The precipitates were analyzed by Western
  blotting with the corresponding antibody. Ponceau S Staining served as a loading
  control. (E) CIK cell lysates were incubated with purified his-tagged VP7, The precipitates
  from the pulldown complex were analyzed by Western blotting with the corresponding
  antibody. EEA1 (early endosomal antigen 1) served as an early endosome marker. Ponceau
  S Staining served as a loading control. Pulldown analyses were conducted to determine
  the interaction between STAT3 and VP7 in CIK cells. IP and WCL indicate immunoprecipitation
  and whole-cell-lysates, respectively. (F) The direct interaction between VP7 and
  HSP90 was examined by far-Western blotting analysis in vitro. His tagged VP7 served
  as bait followed by his antibody to probe the HSP90 signal from the CIK lysates.
  (G) GCO, CIK, or 293T cells stably expressing tagged VP7 and HSP90 were prepared
  to analyze their colocalization by immunofluorescence analysis. Scale bars: 20 μm.
  (H) CIK cells pre-treated with different doses of VP7 were infected with GCRV at
  28°C for 1 h and prepared to analyze the relative viral genome entry by RT-PCR analysis.
  (I) CIK cells pre-treated with VP7 or endocytosis pathway inhibitor were infected
  with GCRV at 28°C for 1 h and prepared to quantify the relative viral genome entry
  by RT-PCR. Cells pre-treated with Vec as a control. (J) CIK cells pre-treated with
  VP7 in the presence or absence of AUY922 were infected with GCRV at 28°C for 1 h
  and prepared to quantify relative viral genome entry by RT-PCR. (K) CIK cells transfected
  with VP7 or vector plasmids were prepared for live cell imaging with Nikon confocal
  laser microscope system. (L) CIK cells treated with purified VP7 protein were prepared
  to analyze the morphological and structural change by electron microscopy analysis.
  (M) CIK cells pre-treated with VP7 were infected with GCRV at 28°C for 1 h and prepared
  to quantify the relative expression of many plasma membrane-related genes by RT-PCR.
  Data were presented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. Statistical
  analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA between different groups and the asterisk
  (*) indicates significant differences between groups. * p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.'
