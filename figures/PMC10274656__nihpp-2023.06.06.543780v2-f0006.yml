figure_title: Glucose metabolism is necessary for proper mesoderm migration
caption: (A) Average lengths of lateral mesodermal wings are significantly shorter
  in 2-DG + BrPA (n=7 embryos), YZ9 (n=7 embryos), and PD (n=10 embryos) treated embryos
  compared to control (n=38 embryos). Plots show mean ± SEM. Two-tailed parametric
  t-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,***P < 0.001. (B) Schematic of mesoderm explant isolations
  of embryos for subsequent live-imaging of ex situ migration dynamics. (C) Representative
  maximum projection images of Control, PD, and YZ9 treated mesodermal explants at
  the end of 4h live imaging, with red asterisks indicating daughter cells that have
  divided since the start of imaging. Reporter LEF-GFP signal (cyan) was used for
  nuclear segmentations and tracking. Scale bars represent 40μm. (D) Plots show migration
  readouts across 3 independent experimental replicates of explants generated from
  AIVIA cell-tracking software, showing that PD and YZ9 treated mesoderm have higher
  rates of proliferation and shorter migratory lengths compared to control. ‘Cell
  proliferation’ datapoints represent independent experiments. ‘Cell displacement’
  and ‘mean velocity’ datapoints represent unique cell tracks. Plots show mean ± SEM.
  Two-tailed parametric t-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
  Azaserine treatment shows no significant difference. (E) Invadapodia assay of mesoderm
  explants on FITC-Fibronectin-coated plates, showing impaired ECM substrate degradation
  in 2-DG + BrPA, YZ9, and PD treated explants (n=3 experimental replicates). Scale
  bars represent 100μm. Plots show mean ± SEM. Two-tailed parametric t-test. **P <
  0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Those treatment groups also resulted in (F)
  increased ECad expression (heatmap intensity colours used for better visualisation).
  Scale bars represent 100μm. (G) Pathway enrichment (KEGG) of the differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in PD and YZ9 treated mesoderm explants, specifically shows
  downregulated terms
