figure_title: Pro-development effects of breast milk and different infant formulae
  on intestine organoids.
caption: 'Pro-development effects of breast milk and different infant formulae on
  intestine organoids. (a) Radar plot of GO-enriched pathways’ z-score of breast milk
  group and PMF group. Methods are from GeneTonic, an R package for RNA-seq data.
  Z-score implies the intensity and direction of pathway enrichment. PMF means powder
  milk (infant formulae), gathering PMF1, PMF2, and PMF3 as one group. (b) GSEA results
  of GO: Canonical Wnt signaling pathway from shared DEG of BM, PMF1, PMF2, and PMF3.
  NES means normalized enrichment score. (c) Heatmap of core enrichment genes of GSEA:
  canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (d) Heatmap of GSVA score of selected pathways
  associated with growth and development of intestine for each sample. (e) Cilium
  assembly and epithelial tube formation’ highly correlated genes (GSVA score-gene,
  spearman correlation > 0.8) and the metabolites highly correlated to them (gene-metabolite,
  spearman correlation > 0.8). (f) mRNA expression level of ‘key genes’ measured by
  RT-qPCR technique (2−ΔΔCt method). All data are presented as mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001; ns, no significance, p ≥ 0.05'
