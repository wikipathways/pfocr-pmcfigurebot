caption: The simplified ergosterol (a) and cholesterol (b) biosynthesis pathway, highlighting
  the inhibition of hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) by statins.
  Ergosterol and cholesterol have a very conserved metabolic pathway and statins act
  inhibiting HMG-CoA reduction to mevalonate, which is a common substrate in both
