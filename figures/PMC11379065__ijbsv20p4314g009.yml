caption: Inhibition of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway is critical for the protective effects
  of Rux in alleviating cellular senescence and SASP in SCM. (A) The mRNA levels of
  SASP-related genes were detected using qRT-PCR after reactivating the JAK2-STAT3
  pathway using r-IL6 in NRCMs, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL3, CXCL10, CCL2
  and GDF15. N = 4. (B,C) The mRNA levels of P16 and P21 were detected using qRT-PCR
  after reactivating the JAK2-STAT3 pathway using r-IL6 in NRCMs. N = 4. (D,E) Representative
  Western blot bands and quantitative analysis of P16 and P21 after reactivating the
  JAK2-STAT3 pathway using r-IL6 in NRCMs. N = 4. (F,G) Representative fluorescence
  images and quantitative analysis of γ-H2AX after reactivating the JAK2-STAT3 pathway
  using r-IL6 in NRCMs. N = 3. (H,I) Representative images and quantitative analysis
  of SA-β-gal staining after reactivating the JAK2-STAT3 pathway using r-IL6 in NRCMs.
  Scale bar = 20 μm, N = 3. Data are presented as mean ± SD. * P<0.05, ** P<0.01,
