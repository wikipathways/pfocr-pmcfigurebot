caption: Heat map of the KEGG pathway TOP3 enriched by differentially expressed genes
  in the crop of male and female pigeons during different reproductive cycles. Female
  pigeons (A) drug metabolism—cytochrome P450, (B) steroid hormone biosynthesis, and
  (C) retinol metabolism. Male pigeons (D) drug metabolism—cytochrome P450, (E) cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interactions, and (F) hematopoietic cell lineage
