caption: |-
  PAE upregulated FSHR/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway in the ovaries of DOR mice. (A) The expressions of aromatase, FSHR, PKAc, and p-CREB/CREB in the ovaries were detected by using Western blot. (Bâ€“E) Each immunoreaction band of aromatase, FSHR, PKAc, and p-CREB/CREB was normalized against GAPDH. (F) Relative level of cAMP in the ovaries. n = 3 per group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. Con group; #
  p < 0.05 vs. DOR group
