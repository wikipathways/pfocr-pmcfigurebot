caption: (A) Heat map showing the percent change in P-S6k fluorescence for each genetic
  manipulation as compared to its proper control. (B) Raptor fluorescence is significantly
  decreased in CCT5 LOF conditions and is not rescued by overexpression of Raptor.
  (C) P-S6k fluorescence levels are significantly decreased in CCT5 LOF and are not
  rescued by overexpression of S6k. (D) Representative images of combined TORC1 genetic
  manipulations. Scale bars = 100 Î¼m. (E) Total dendritic length in microns for WT
  and combined TORC1 genetic manipulations. In all panels * = p < 0.05, see  for detailed
  statistics.
