caption: Biological network of Ras‐GTP pathway. Yellow boxes with names are protein
  molecules. We first start on the top left of the circuit inside the dotted box with
  RD, a short form for Ras‐GDP, and RT for Ras‐GTP. The interactions inside the dotted
  box show the new reaction for the interaction between Ira2 and Cyr1, ATP and Cyr1,
  which plays a vital role in forming cAMP. Subsequently, the other module outside
  the box is the derepression of PKA by cAMP that releases the catalytic C part of
  the PKA and downregulates cAMP through phosphodiesteRases PDE‐1 and 2 to form a
  negative feedback loop. The ri's represent the rates of the reactions based on mass
  action kinetic laws. In detail, Ras‐GDP is converted to RT, the Ras‐GTP, by the
  enzyme cdc25. The enzyme Ira2 carries out the reverse reaction. Cyr1, the enzyme
  adenyl‐cyclase, binds to Ira2 to form a complex C5 to arrest the conversion of Ras‐GTP
  to Ras‐GDP, and thereby reduce its activity. Cyr1 also binds to ATP, which forms
  an inactive complex C6. This inactive complex C6 binds to RT to form a trimer C7
  that facilitates cAMP formation. The competition between complexes C5 and C6 decides
  the RT activity and cAMP formation. This tug‐of‐war for RTP by C5 and C6 leads to
  a positive feedback loop that generates bistability for the choice of parameters.
  Both cAMP and ATP undergo first‐order exponential degradation. ri are the rates
  of the reaction. The only role of cAMP is to derepress the catalytic part of PKA
  from the regulatory part by a sequence of steps that forms complexes C13–C16. The
  final complex C16 dissociates PKA and ejects out cAMP. The catalytic part of PKA
  involves cAMP degradation through negative feedback that involves low‐affinity phosphodiesteRases‐1
  (PDE1) and gets converted to AMP. The high‐affinity phosphodiester Rase‐2 (PDE2)
  also converts cAMP to AMP to maintain the cAMP homeostasis. Note that we do not
  provide the details of the enzymatic conversion of PDE1 to PDE1P and have given
  only the rates ri's.
