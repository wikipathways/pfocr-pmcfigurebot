figure_title: CircRILPL1 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of NPC cells in
  vivo
caption: 'CNE2 cells (2 × 106) transfected with the empty vector, the circRILPL1 overexpression
  plasmid, antisense oligonucleotides against circRILPL1 (ASO-circRILPL1), or the
  scramble negative control were injected subcutaneously, through the tail vein, or
  footpad of nude mice (n = 6 per group). A Representative images of subcutaneous
  tumor tissues (n = 6 per group). B The tumor volume growth curves (top) and the
  tumor weights (bottom) of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. C Representative images
  of H&E staining, circRILPL1 staining, and Ki67 staining of subcutaneous tumor sections.
  Magnification: 200×, scale bar = 100 μm. D Representative images of lung tissues
  dissected from nude mice (top, n = 6 per group). Representative images of metastatic
  nodules on the lung surface as indicated by arrows (bottom). E Quantification of
  the number of metastatic nodes in the lungs. F Representative images of H&E staining
  of metastatic lung lesions and the expression of circRILPL1 by ISH assay. Magnification:
  40×, scale bar = 500 μm; Magnification: 200×, scale bar = 100 μm. G Images of inguinal
  lymph nodes dissected from nude mice 28 days after injection via footpad (n = 6
  per group). H The volume (top) and weight (bottom) of lymph nodes were measured
  for each group. I Representative images of H&E staining of inguinal lymph nodes
  showing metastatic tumor cells. Magnification: 100×, scale bar = 200 μm; Magnification:
  200×, scale bar = 100 μm; Magnification: 400×, scale bar = 50 μm. All experiments
  were technically repeated six times. Data were presented as the means ± SD. *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.'
