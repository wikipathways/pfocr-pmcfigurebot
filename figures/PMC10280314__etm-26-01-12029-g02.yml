caption: Effects of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway on the expression levels of
  p130/E2F4 in mMSCs during differentiation into type II alveolar epithelial cells
  in vitro. (A) SP-C, p130 and E2F4 expression was evaluated in mMSCs at 7 days after
  coculturing with MLE-12 cells and SAGM supplemented with 4 mM LiCl or 200 ng/ml
  DKK-1 (n=3). (B) SP-C, p130 and E2F4 expression was evaluated in mMSCs at 14 days
  after coculturing with MLE-12 cells and SAGM supplemented with 4 mM LiCl or 200
  ng/ml DKK-1 (n=3). **P<0.01 vs. Control group (mMSCs co-cultured with MLE-12 cells
  and SAGM), ***P<0.001 vs. Control group, ****P<0.0001 vs. Control group. DKK-1,
  Dickkopf-related protein 1; E2F4, E2F transcription factor 4; LiCl, lithium chloride;
  mMSCs, mouse mesenchymal stem cells; p-, phosphorylated; SAGM, small airway growth
  medium; SP-C, surfactant protein C; ns, not significant
