  of yak AT2 cells.
caption: ML228 activates the HIF signaling pathway to enhance the proliferation of
  yak AT2 cells. (A,B) The cytotoxicity of DMOG and ML228 on AT2 cells was assessed
  using a CCK-8 assay. (C) Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the impact
  of different concentrations of ML228 on the protein levels of HIF-1α, EGFR, EGF,
  and PCNA in AT2 cells. (D–G) Gray value analysis was conducted for Western blot
  results depicting expression levels of HIF-1α, EGFR, EGF, and PCNA proteins (n =
  3). (H,I) Immunofluorescence staining revealed the quantification of Ki67-positive
  (red) cells in AT2 cells following treatment with varying concentrations of ML228
  (n = 6). (bar = 100 μm). DAPI was used to stain the nucleus (blue). Data are means
  ± SD. ns stands for no difference, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
