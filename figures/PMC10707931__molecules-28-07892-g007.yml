figure_title: qRT-PCR analysis of differentially expressed genes in the terpenoid
  and alkaloid biosynthesis pathways.
caption: qRT-PCR analysis of differentially expressed genes in the terpenoid and alkaloid
  biosynthesis pathways. The X-axis represents the average change in the expression
  value, the Y-axis represents different expression patterns at six time points, and
  the FPKM values represents the average transcriptome sequencing value. The FPKM
  values are shown in red, and the relative expression (RE) levels are shown in cyan.
  A red asterisk indicates that the FPKM value is significant; a black asterisk indicates
  that the RE is significant; *, ** and *** represent significant p-values â‰¤ 0.05,
  0.01, 0.001, respectively
