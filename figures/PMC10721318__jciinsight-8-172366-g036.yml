figure_title: Activated ERBB2-mediated receptor tyrosine kinase in the TKR subgroup
caption: (A) Relative expression of ERBB2 among the BSL, TKR, and MSL subgroups (Kruskal-Wallis
  test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). (B) GO-ERBB2 signaling pathway
  ssGSEA scores among the BSL, TKR, and MSL subgroups. (C and D) GO activation transmembrane
  receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity ssGSEA scores among the BSL, TKR, and
  MSL subgroups from the FUSCC (C) and TCGA (D) data sets. (B–D) One-way ANOVA followed
  by Dunnett’s t test. (E) Expression levels of protein tyrosine kinase activity–related
  genes across the mRNA subgroups (upper, positively regulated genes; lower, negatively
  regulated genes). (F) Volcano plot illustrating DEGs between the TKR subgroup and
  the other subgroups. (G) GO Biological Process (GO-BP) and GO Molecular Function
  (GO-MF) pathways were enriched on the basis of upregulated DEGs in the TKR subgroup
  (hypergeometric test). (H) GO regulation of MAPK cascade ssGSEA scores between TKR
  and other subgroups in HER2-low TNBC from the FUSCC data set. (I) GO regulation
  of MAPK cascade (left), GO activated MAPKK activity ssGSEA scores (middle), and
  GO activated MAPK activity ssGSEA scores (right) between TKR and other subgroups
  in HER2-low TNBC from the TCGA data set. (H and I) Student’s t test. Statistical
  significance was set at P < 0.05
