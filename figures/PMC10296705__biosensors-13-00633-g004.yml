  responsive biosensors.
caption: 'The biosynthesis pathways of various alkaloids and their corresponding responsive
  biosensors. (a) The biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) is shown
  along with the applications of DOD-coupled L-DOPA biosensor and RamR variant to
  enhance the production of (S)-reticuline and THP, respectively. Specifically, the
  DOD-coupled L-DOPA biosensor was used to screen tyrosine hydroxylase mutants in
  (S)-reticuline synthesis pathway, while RamR, a THP responsive biosensor, was utilized
  to screen O-methyltransferases (OMTs) in THP synthesis pathway. (b) The biosynthesis
  of theophylline and the potential application of a theophylline-sensing riboswitch.
  Riboswitches are easily manipulable, and therefore, manipulated theophylline-sensing
  riboswitches hold the potential to be applied in drug discovery of theophylline
  derivatives. (c) The biosynthesis of tryptophan-derived ergot alkaloids and the
  possible utilization of tryptophan-responsive biosensors. TrpR, a transcriptional
  repressor, can be used to balance cell growth and tryptophan production to provide
  sufficient precursor. TnaC, a leading peptide, acts as an activator to upregulate
  the synthases of D-lysergic acid. (d) The biosynthesis of putrescine is presented
  along with the application of a putrescine-responsive biosensor. PuuR is capable
  of detecting the titer of putrescine in real-time by testing PpuuO-controlled GFP
  readout. Abbreviation: G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P,
  D-erythrose 4-phosphate; DAHP, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate; CHA,
  Chorismate; AA, Anthranilate; 4HPP, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate; 4-HPAA, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde;
  NOR, norlaudanosoline; THP, tetrahydropapaverine. BIAs, benzylisoquinoline alkaloids;
  PP pathway, Pentose phosphate pathway. One solid arrow, one-step reaction; Two solid
  arrows, multiple-step reactions'
