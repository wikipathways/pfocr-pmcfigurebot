figure_title: Exposure to herbal extracts of Torenia sp.
caption: Exposure to herbal extracts of Torenia sp. induces the active DNA damage
  response pathway in C. elegans, leading to elevated levels of key DNA damage checkpoint
  components, phosphorylated CHK-1, and apoptosis. (A) Exposure to Torenia sp.-H extracts
  results in heightened expressions of atm-1 and atl-1, confirming the activation
  of the DNA damage response pathway. (B) Elevated pCHK-1 foci observed in germlines
  underscores the active DNA damage response following exposure to T.s.-H extracts.
  Arrows indicate pCHK-1 foci localized on nuclei. Bar = 2 µm. (C) The pachytene stage
  demonstrated an elevated incidence of apoptosis, indicating that unrepaired DNA
  damage prompts checkpoint activation and subsequent apoptosis (arrows) within the
  germline. Asterisks indicate statistical significance by the two-tailed Mann–Whitney
  test. Bar = 20 µm
