caption: IL1B+ cDC2s are the main executor on cDC2s. UMAP plot showing DC subgroups
  of the discovery cohort. (B) Bubble plot displaying unique markers of different
  DC subgroups. (C) Differential expression of genes related to DC function across
  DC subgroups. (D) UMAP plot illustrating the distribution of DC subgroups across
  different tissues and under different treatment conditions. (E) Bar graph showing
  the proportion of DC subgroups across different tissues and under different treatment
  conditions. (F) Volcano plot depicting differential genes between two cDC2 subgroups.
  (G) Multicolor immunofluorescence staining confirms the presence of two types of
  cDC2 in human HCC tissues. (H) Bubble plot shows the differences in the co-receptor
  pairing between the two types of cDC2 and CD4+ T cell subgroups (p-values < 0.05,
  IL1B+ cDC2 vs DPYD+ cDC2). (I) Cell interactions between IL1B+ cDC2 dendritic cell
  and CD4+ T cell subgroups in the tumor tissue of non-responsive patients. (J) Cell
  interactions between DPYD+ cDC2 dendritic cell and CD4+ T cell subgroups in the
  tumor tissue of non-responsive patients. (K) Communication of the CD40 signaling
  pathway between cDC2 dendritic cells and CD4+ T cell subgroups. (L) Communication
  of the TGF-Î² signaling pathway between cDC2 dendritic cells and CD4+ T cell subgroups.
