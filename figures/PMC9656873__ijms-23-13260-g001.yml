caption: The roles of cyclin-dependent kinase and cGAS–STING signaling. Cyclin-dependent
  kinase 1 (CDK1), CDK2, and CDK6 inhibit SAMHD1 antiviral function via phosphorylation
  and inactivation. HBV recruits cyclin E2 to bind CDK2 and further phosphorylates
  SAMHD1 to abrogate its restriction of HBV replication. SARS-CoV-1 suppresses the
  activity of cyclin d-CDK4 and cyclin A/E–CDK2 complexes, and SARS-CoV-2 enhances
  the phosphorylation of CDK2 to inhibit cellular mitosis. Pattern recognition receptors
  are essential in sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and DAMPs.
  For example, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize a variety of PAMPs and DAMPs that
  initiate the inflammatory process via NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B cells) and the
  synthesis and release of cytokines and IFNs. Inflammasomes are a separate class
  of intracellularly expressed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize
  nucleic acids and mediate proinflammatory responses. Cell surface–expressed ACE2
  and TLR4 increase the NLRP3 inflammasome downstream mediator caspase-1, and exposure
  to spike proteins upregulates the protein expression involved in the positive stimulation
  of TLR4 signaling and the inflammasome pathway. The induction of neuroinflammation
  in microglia is mediated through the activation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase), possibly due to TLR4 activation. TLR4 has been found to play a
  critical role as a mediator of the neurotoxicity induced by α-synuclein oligomers.
  Misfolded α-synuclein (α-Syn) induces inflammatory responses, and extracellular
  α-Syn can activate proinflammatory TLR4 pathways in astrocytes, but α-Syn uptake
  is independent of TLR4. The interaction between TLR4 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
  can trigger an intracellular TLR4 signaling cascade. NF-kB’s transcriptional activation
  of specific genes induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which can cause
  neuronal damage and the pathological modification of α-Syn. Serum neurofilament
  light chain (NFL) is a biomarker of neuronal injury. NFL was higher in COVID-19
  patients than in the control groups. Higher NFL levels were associated with neuronal
  injury. This is common in critically ill patients. The hyperinflammatory state of
  COVID-19 has high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and this might have triggered
  central nervous system neuroinflammation through the activation of astrocytes and
  microglia, which could have facilitated prion-like pathology. In addition, similar
  to other prion proteins, the spike protein also contains several prionogenic domains.
  Thus, direct toxic action of the spike protein, triggering a neurodegenerative condition
  mimicking a prion disease-like pathology, is also possible. The biological implications
  of nuclear cGAS and its interaction with chromatin, including various mechanisms
  for nuclear cGAS inhibition, the release of chromatin-bound cGAS, the regulation
  of different cGAS pools in the cell, and chromatin structure/chromatin protein effects
  on cGAS activation, could lead to cGAS-induced autoimmunity. Cytosolic DNA recognition
  leads to active cGAS by clustering and forming large liquid—liquid phase-separated
  cGAS–DNA condensates, excluding the ER-directed exonuclease three-prime repair exonuclease
  1 (TREX1). Nuclear cGAS is sequestered at chromatin in an inactive state. Active
  cGAS produces cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which binds to STING. STING relocalizes to
  the perinuclear Golgi and forms a clustered platform where the tank-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1) kinase phosphorylates the transcription factor IRF3 (interferon regulatory
  factor 3). Phosphorylated IRF3 enters the nucleus and, along with NF-κB, triggers
  the expression of type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine genes (reproduced
  from []) (HBV, hepatitis B virus; P, phosphate; the green arrows indicate enhancement
  and the dashed arrow indicates the effect is uncertain; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase;
