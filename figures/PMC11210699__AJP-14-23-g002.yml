caption: Baicalein/baicalin might be autophagy inducers by activating the AMPK/ULK1
  pathway and negatively regulating the mTOR complex, and apoptosis inducers by interrupting
  the caveolin-1/Akt/mTOR. They might also inhibit the proliferation process by suppressing
  β-catenin signaling pathway, and reduction of migration and invasion by suppressing
  TLR4/NF-κB pathway, and metastasis by mediating miR-7/FAK/AKT pathway.
