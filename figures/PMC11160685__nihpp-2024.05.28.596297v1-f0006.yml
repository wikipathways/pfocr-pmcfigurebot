figure_title: Aging suppresses microglial core clock oscillation and circadian gene
  expression
caption: A. Heatmaps showing transcripts that were rhythmic in microglia from young
  WT mice (upper) and rhythmic in aged mice (lower). In both rows of heatmaps, the
  genes plotted are in the same order to compare differences in rhythmic expression
  between mice. B. KEGG pathway analysis of microglial transcripts identified as rhythmic
  (by RAIN analysis) in aged mice. C. Heatmaps showing temporally-coordinated expression
  of KEGG metabolic pathway genes in microglia from young WT, APP/PS1, and aged mice.
  D-F. Graphs showing circadian expression patterns of transcripts from microglia
  from WT (blue) or APP/PS1 (red) mice. D. Core clock genes Per2, Arntl (Bmal1), Nr1d1,
  and Ciart remained rhythmic but were blunted and suppressed in aged microglia. E.
  Endosomal trafficing gene Rab5c and proteasome subunit Psmd11 are induced and gain
  rhythmicity in aged microglia. F. The lipoprotein receptor Ldlr and transcription
  factor Mafg lose rhythmicity in aged microglia. Adjusted P values from RAIN are
  shown. Each datapoint is the average of two mice, each from separate experiments
