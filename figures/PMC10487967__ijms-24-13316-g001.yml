figure_title: Activation of the cGAS–STING pathway during innate immune response.
caption: 'Activation of the cGAS–STING pathway during innate immune response. The
  DNA from intracellular and extracellular sources is sensed by cGAS. After DNA recognition,
  cGAS catalyzes its substrates, GTP and ATP, into cGAMP. cGAMP is then sensed by
  STING located at the ER. Upon cGAMP binding, STING translocates from the ER to the
  ERGIC and recruits TBK1, followed by which STING and TBK1 are trafficked to the
  Golgi with the assistance of COPII and TRAPβ. Finally, STING and TBK1 interact with
  IRF3 and IκBα, culminating in type-I IFN and cytokine production. Abbreviations:
  mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; 2′3′-cGAMP, 2′3′-cGMP-AMP;
  STING, stimulator of interferon genes; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, ER–Golgi
  intermediate compartment; TRAPβ, translocon-associated protein β; COPII, cytoplasmic
  coat protein complex-II; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; IRF-3, interferon regulatory
  factor-3; IκBα: inhibitors of transcription factor NF-κB; type-I IFN, type-I interferon;
  IL-6, interleukin 6; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; GTP, guanosine triphosphate;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate'
