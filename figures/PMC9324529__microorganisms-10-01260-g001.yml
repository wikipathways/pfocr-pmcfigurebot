caption: Mechanisms of Brucella’s antigen presentation impairment. Brucella has evolved
  multiple ways to dampen antigen presentation by (A) macrophages and (B) dendritic
  cells, preventing proficient development of an adaptive immunity. (A) Recognition
  of Brucella lipoproteins by TLR2 leads to IL-6-dependent inhibition of the transcription
  factor CIITA, resulting in diminished transcription and expression of IFN-γ-induced
  MHC-II. Moreover, Brucella abortus LPS (Ba LPS) reaches the cell surface, forming
  macrodomains with MHC-II molecules and interfering with the presentation of peptides
  to CD4+ T cells. This impairment also influences cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, since recognition
  of Brucella abortus RNA (Ba RNA) induces retention of MHCI molecules within the
  Golgi apparatus via TLR8 and the EGFR pathway. (B) The Omp25-SLAMF1 interaction
  limits NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine
  secretion and costimulatory molecules expression in dendritic cells. The Brucella
  effectors BtpA and BtpB, translocated to the cytoplasm during infection, interfere
  with TLR2 and TLR4 signalling and control dendritic cell maturation. In both cell
  types, the peculiar structure of the Ba LPS, specially its core, makes it poorly
  recognised by the TLR4-MD2 complex preventing full activation, NF-κB translocation
  and impairing dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation. Nuclear phosphorylated
  active NF-κB dimers are represented in green.
