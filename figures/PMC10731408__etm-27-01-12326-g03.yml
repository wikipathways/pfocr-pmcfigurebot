caption: 'Sema3A inhibits autophagy by activating the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
  H9c2 cells transfected with Sema3A overexpression lentivirus were incubated with
  10 µM ISO for 24 h in the absence of (A) rapamycin or (B) after pretreatment with
  50 nM rapamycin. Protein expression levels of p-mTOR, mTOR, p-Akt, Akt, p-4EBP1
  and 4EBP1 were semi-quantified using western blotting. Protein bands were semi-quantified
  by densitometry, with GAPDH used for normalization. Data are presented as mean ±
  standard error of the mean. **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001
  vs. control + ISO; &&P<0.01 and &&&P<0.001 vs. Sema3A over + ISO; @P<0.05 and @@@P<0.001
  vs. Control + ISO + Rap. Sema3A over, Semaphorin-3A overexpression lentivirus; ISO,
  isoproterenol; Rap, rapamycin; p, phosphorylated; 4EBP1, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1'
