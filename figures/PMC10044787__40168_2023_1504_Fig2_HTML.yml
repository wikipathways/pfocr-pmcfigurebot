caption: Highly expressed genes in the core region were correlated with the content
  of monoterpenes. a KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in
  peels, leaves and roots from the core region compared with the non-core region.
  The upper part of the figure displays the metabolic pathway enriched by the upregulated
  genes in core regions, and the lower part represents metabolic pathways enriched
  by the upregulated genes in non-core regions. Node size represents the number of
  upregulated genes within the pathway, and colour represents the significance of
  the pathway. ‘Gene count’ represents the number of genes enriched in a pathway.
  b Correlation-based network between root gene expression (nodes) and monoterpenes
  (triangles). Node size corresponds to the degree of each monoterpene. The thickness
  and colour of the edges denote the strength and significance, respectively. Solid
  and dashed edges indicate positive and negative correlations, respectively. c Cumulative
  relative abundance of six genes enriched in root samples. Significance is indicated
  between core and non-core regions by the Wilcoxon rank sum test
