caption: Activated AXL protects against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by upregulating
  SOCS-1 expression. Activated AXL exerts a protective effect against hepatic I/R
  injury through SOCS-1-TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. AXL, AXL receptor tyrosine
  kinase; Gas6, growth arrest-specific protein 6; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; MYD88,
  myeloid differentiation factor-88; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; SOCS, suppressor
  of cytokine signaling protein; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; TRAF6, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor–associated factor 6.
