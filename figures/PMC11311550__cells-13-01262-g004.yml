figure_title: Dlx5 expression is inhibited by the activation of a TrkB-CREB signalling
  pathway.
caption: 'Dlx5 expression is inhibited by the activation of a TrkB-CREB signalling
  pathway. C57BL/6 mice were treated with IP injections of Flx and of compounds interacting
  with the TrKB signalling pathways, and the effects on cortical Dlx5 expression were
  measured after 24 h by qPCR. (A) 7–8DHF, a TrkB agonist, induced a reduction in
  Dlx5 expression similar to that of Flx (vehicle n = 5, Flx n = 5; 7–8DHF n = 6).
  (B) The Flx-dependent inhibition of Dlx5 expression was blocked in the presence
  of ANA-12, a TrkB antagonist (vehicle n = 6, Flx n = 7; ANA-12 n = 6, ANA-12 + Flx
  n = 6) (C,D) Flx was co-administered with antagonists of two TrkB major effectors:
  the CREB pathway, blocked by 666-15, and the mTor pathway, blocked by rapamycin.
  We observed that Flx’s action on Dlx5 expression is blocked by 666-15 (n = 6 per
  group) (C) but is insensitive to rapamycin treatment (n = 6 per group) (D). Kruskal–Wallis
  test * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001'
