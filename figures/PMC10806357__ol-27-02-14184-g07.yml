figure_title: Knockdown of DKK1 inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, migration
  and invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.
caption: 'Knockdown of DKK1 inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, migration
  and invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Bright-field and GFP fluorescence
  images of (A) SCC-9 cells and (B) CAL-27 cells with Lv-shCon and Lv-shDKK1 infection.
  Scale Bar=50 µm. (C) DKK1 mRNA expression and (D) DKK1 secretion by SCC-9 cells
  and CAL-27 cells infected with Lv-shCon and Lv-shDKK1. Cell proliferation rate of
  (E) SCC-9 and (F) CAL-27 cells. (G) Colony formation of SCC-9 cells and CAL-27 cells.
  (H) Representative wound healing images of SCC-9 cells and (I) quantification of
  the wound healing assay. (J) Representative wound healing images of CAL-27 cells
  and (K) quantification of the wound healing assay, magnification: 40×. Representative
  images of the Transwell invasion assay for (L) SCC-9 and (M) CAL-27 cells, magnification:
  100×. (N) Cell counts of invaded SCC-9 and CAL-27 cells. (O) Western blot analysis
  of Wnt-3a, β-catenin and DKK1 expression in SCC-9 and CAL-27 cells infected with
  Lv-shCon and Lv-shDKK1. *P<0.05 **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 for shDKK1 vs. shCon. DKK1,
  Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Lv,
  lentivirus; shCon, shRNA control; shDKK1, shRNA targeting DKK1; shRNA, short hairpin
  RNA'
