caption: Schematic presentation of the interaction between estrogen receptor (ER)
  and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. They converge on activating CDK4/6, leading to phosphorylation
  of Rb and releasing E2F, which, in turn, allows the progression of the cell cycle
  from the G1 to the S phase. Multiple therapeutic agents can be used to block the
  steps of such pathways [17,18]
