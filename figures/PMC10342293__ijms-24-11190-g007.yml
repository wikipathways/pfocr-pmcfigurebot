caption: Regulated metabolic pathways. (A) The phenylpropanoids biosynthesis pathway,
  (B) the steroid biosynthesis pathway, and (C) tryptophan metabolism coupled with
  its downstream auxin signaling pathway. These pathways were simplified based on
  the KEGG pathways, where solid lines represented direct reactions and dashed lines
  represented indirect reactions with multiple steps. The metabolites were shown in
  black font, while enzymes were depicted in blue font. DEMs associated with this
  pathway were presented using boxplots, showing their abundance changes following
  WUS transfection. The y-axis of the boxplot represents the log2-transformed relative
  abundance of the compounds. DEGs associated with this pathway were represented using
  a heatmap, showing their expression changes following WUS transfection. Blue indicated
  low expression, while red indicated high expression
