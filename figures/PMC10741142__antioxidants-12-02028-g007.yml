figure_title: Inhibitory effects of 6PP on the MAPK phosphorylation.
caption: 'Inhibitory effects of 6PP on the MAPK phosphorylation. Raw264.7 cells were
  pretreated with 6PP at indicated concentrations for 2 h and then stimulated with
  LPS (0.5 µg/mL) for 15 min. The levels of phosphorylated and total MAPK signaling
  pathway factors (SAPK/JNK, p44/42, and p38) were assessed using western blotting,
  with β-actin as the loading control. The levels of p-SAPK/JNK, p-p44/42, and p-p38
  were normalized to levels of SAPK/JNK, p44/42, and p38, respectively. The data represent
  the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Statistical differences between
  groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. # indicates p < 0.05 vs. the
  LPS-untreated group. * indicates p < 0.05 vs. the LPS-treated group. ns indicates
  not significant. MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SAPK/JNK, stress-activated
  protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases; p-, phosphorylated'
