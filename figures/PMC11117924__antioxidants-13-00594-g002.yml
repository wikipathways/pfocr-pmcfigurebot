caption: 'Schematic representation of the pathogenesis of DR leading to a disruption
  of the redox homeostasis in the eye. Hyperglycemia triggers oxidative stress responses
  through multiple pathways, ultimately leading to DR. In this context, PKC inhibitors,
  NOX inhibitors, and antioxidant agents antagonize the effect of oxidative stress.
  AGE: advanced glycation end products; GlcNAc-6-P: N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate;
  GSH: glutathione; H2O2: hydrogen peroxide; PKC: protein kinase C; NADPH: nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NOX: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
