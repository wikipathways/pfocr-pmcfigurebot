caption: 'CNSE and RESV reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines production in BV-2 cells.
  BV-2 cells were pre-treated with CNSE or RESV for 24 h with or without LPS 1 μg/mL
  for 3 h. The levels of mRNA expression of (A) IL-1β, (B) TNF-α, and (C) IL-6 were
  detected by real-time PCR, and the relative expression of these genes was normalized
  to β-actin and showed a fold change compared to the non-treated control. ELISA kit
  was also used to observe the protein releasing of (D) IL-1β, (E) TNF-α, and (F)
  IL-6. The cell supernatant was collected after CNSE and RESV treatment, followed
  by LPS 1 μg/mL for 24 h. Data represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.
  The significant difference was represented by p-value less than 0.05 (###p < 0.001,
  ####p < 0.0001 vs. non-treated control, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 and
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 vs. LPS-treated control).'
