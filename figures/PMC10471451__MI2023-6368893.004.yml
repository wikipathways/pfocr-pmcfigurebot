caption: Correlation between 27 candidate genes in the p53 signaling pathway and prognosis
  in patients with GC analyzed by Lasso and multivariate cox regression. (a) In the
  figure, the name of the DEG is on the left, and the p-value is in the middle. The
  risk rate distribution of the genes is shown on the right side, where the left part
  indicates low risk and the right part indicates high risk. The HR indicates the
  risk rate; the risk rate greater than 1 indicates high risk, and less than 1 indicates
  low risk. (b) The abscissa represents the log (位) value, the ordinate represents
  the coefficients value, the colored lines represent the genes used for the calculation,
  and the upper horizontal axis represents the number of genes. (c) The abscissa represents
  log (位) value, and the ordinate represents partial likelihood deviance. The upper
  part is the corresponding log (位) value, which can be used to calculate the number
  of genes retained. The dotted line shows partial likelihood deviance, the corresponding
  log (位) value, and the number of genes retained in the optimal condition
