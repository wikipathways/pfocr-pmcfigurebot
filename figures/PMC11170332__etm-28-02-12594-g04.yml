caption: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis for Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase domain
  1 in stomach adenocarcinoma. (A) Enrichment in the retinoblastoma gene in cancer
  pathway. (B) Enrichment in the ATR activation in response to replication stress
  pathway. (C) Enrichment in the resolution of D-loop structures pathway. (D) Enrichment
  in the PLK1 pathway. (E) Enrichment in the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange
  pathway. (F) Enrichment in the nuclear pore complex NPC disassembly pathway
