figure_title: Effects of PLE0 on the JNK signaling pathway in HT-29 cells.
caption: Effects of PLE0 on the JNK signaling pathway in HT-29 cells. (A) Cells were
  treated with PLE0 for 24 h. Western blot analysis was performed on total cellular
  proteins using specific antibodies. As an internal control, β-Actin was used. (B)
  Cells were treated with SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor, for 48 h. The migration
  and invasive traits of HT-29 cells were evaluated through wound-healing and invasion
  assays, respectively. (C) Cells were transfected with negative control and JNK siRNA.
  Specific antibodies were used to detect JNK and β-catenin in the total cellular
  proteins that were collected and adjusted. (D–F) Cells were transfected with 100
  pM of negative control and JNK siRNA and then treated with the indicated concentration
  of PLE0 for 24 h. The mRNA levels were analyzed using gene-specific primers as described
  in the experimental Section 2.6. The means ± SD of three separate experiments were
  reported. The differences between groups were assessed using analysis of variance
  and Dunnett’s post hoc test to determine significance. * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001
