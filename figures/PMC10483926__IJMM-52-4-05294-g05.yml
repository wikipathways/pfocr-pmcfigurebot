  pathway.
caption: TgESPs regulate aerobic glycolysis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  (A) Seahorse analysis of ECAR in the presence or absence of Icg-001 with the addition
  of TgESPs to hBMSCs for inducing osteogenic differentiation for 7 days. (B) Basal
  and compensatory glycolysis in the ECAR assay. (C) Lactate production in hBMSCs
  after three days of TgESP treatment in the presence or absence of Icg-001. (D) Reverse
  transcription-quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA levels of PFKFB3, PFKFB4, ENO3 and
  LDHA in hBMSCs after 7 days of osteogenic induction by TgESPs in the presence or
  absence of Icg-001. (E) Western blot analysis of protein levels of PFKFB3 and LDHA
  in hBMSCs after 14 days of osteogenic induction by TgESPs in the presence or absence
  of Icg-001. (F) Quantitative analysis of the expression of each protein using β-actin
  as the internal control. *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001. TgESPs, Toxoplasma gondii
