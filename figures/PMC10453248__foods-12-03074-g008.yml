figure_title: Effects of TPE on serum LPS, inflammation, and the hepatic TLR4/NF-ΚB
  signal pathway in HFD-fed mice.
caption: Effects of TPE on serum LPS, inflammation, and the hepatic TLR4/NF-ΚB signal
  pathway in HFD-fed mice. Levels of serum (A) LPS, (B) TNF-α, (C) IL-6, (D) IL-1β.
  (E,F) Protein expression of hepatic TLR4 and NF-ΚB p65. The data are expressed as
  the means ± SEM (n = 3–8). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001,
  indicating significant differences between these groups
