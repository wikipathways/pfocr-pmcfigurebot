figure_title: Typical pathway of miRNA formation.
caption: Typical pathway of miRNA formation. miRNA genes are transcribed in the nucleus
  primarily through the RNA polymerase complex (RNA Pol II) to form hairpin-structured
  long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs). The 5′ pri-miRNA terminus has a guanosine
  cap, but the 3′ terminus is not always polyadenylated. dgCR8 and the Drosha protein
  microprocessing complexes direct the processing of pri-miRNAs, leading to the release
  of the 5′ and 3′ ends of the transcripts and subsequent conformational changes.
  The resulting precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are recognized through their 3′ free
  end and transported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore by the Exportin-5
  and Ran-GTP complexes. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are bound by a complex of Dicer
  and TRBP proteins, and Dicer eliminates the transcript’s ring structure, forming
  a double complementary strand. The RISC degrades or inhibits miRNA formation; however,
  some miRNAs are still detected in the cells and bodily fluids of organisms, and
  their roles remain unclear
