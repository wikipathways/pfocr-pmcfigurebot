figure_title: Different molecular features of the VTA Mor-Ens and Shock-Ens.
caption: 'Different molecular features of the VTA Mor-Ens and Shock-Ens. (A) Experimental
  scheme of purifying ribosome-associated mRNAs and sequencing of the VTA Mor-Ens
  or Shock-Ens. (B) An MA-plot with the log2-fold changes (Shock-Ens vs Mor-Ens) over
  the mean of normalized counts. Points with adjusted p-value < 0.05 were colored
  blue. (C) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs: fold change > 1.5 and
  adjusted p value < 0.05) (Shock-Ens n = 7 sample from 14 mice. Mor-Ens n = 6 sample
  from 12 mice). (D) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes encoding neuroactive
  receptors (adjusted p-value < 0.05). (E) Dot plot for DEGs of neuroactive receptors.
  The size of the dots represents the gene mean counts and the color of the dots represents
  the adjusted p-value. (F) Dot plot for DEGs involved in GPCRs signaling pathways.
  The size of the dots represents the gene mean counts; the color of the dots represents
  the adjusted p-value. (G) The protein-protein interaction networks for the DEGs
  involved in GPCR signaling pathways were generated from the STRING database (version:
  11.5, https://cn.string-db.org). (H) An example of the G protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCRs) G-protein signaling pathways and GPCRs/Î²-arrestin/Akt/glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 (GSK-3) signaling pathway'
