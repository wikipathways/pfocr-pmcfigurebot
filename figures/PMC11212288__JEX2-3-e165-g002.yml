caption: GO analysis of the proteins found to be differentially expressed in the LPS
  treated mouse TB and BDEVs compared to the controls. GO analysis based on fold enrichment
  revealed the number of proteins involved in each category. The number of proteins
  involved in each GO category is represented by the length of the bar and the colour
  of the bar represents the –log10 of the adjusted p‐value for that category. (a)
  The differentially expressed TB proteins exhibited molecular functions including
  antioxidant and histone methyltransferase activity, and were involved in biological
  processes including the inflammatory response, neutrophil aggregation, and leukocyte
  migration. Finally, the proteins were found to be involved in regulation of TLR
  signalling as observed in the reactome pathway analysis. (b) The differentially
  expressed BDEV proteins were found to be involved in cellular components including
  the mitochondria and its membrane, exhibited molecular functions including NAD,
  and the TCA cycle, and were involved in biological processes including the metabolic
  processes and glycolysis. Finally, the proteins were found to be involved in regulation
  of TCA cycle, and platelet and degranulation as observed in the reactome pathway
  analysis. BDEV, brain derived extracellular vesicles; GO, Gene ontology; TB, brain
  tissue; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; TLR, toll‐like receptor.
