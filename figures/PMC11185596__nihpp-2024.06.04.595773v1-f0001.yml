figure_title: CdsRNA induces IFN-I signaling and is spatially coincident with pTDP-43
  inclusions in AD
caption: 'a, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cdsRNA and pTDP-43 inclusions in human
  postmortem brain sections of the amygdala. Top panel: healthy control cases, bottom
  panel: AD patient cases. Zoom-ins with 2x magnification. b, LHE, IHC and cyclic
  immunofluorescence (CyCIF) of human postmortem brain sections of the amygdala. IHC
  for cdsRNA, pTDP-43, tau, and Aß on different brain sections of the same healthy
  control (top panel, healthy control case II)/AD patient (bottom panel, AD case I).
  CyCIF panels show nuclei (Sytox Blue), Aß, dsRNA, pTDP-43, and tau as well as a
  merge of all channels. CyCIF was done on a single brain section of the same healthy
  control as the IHC images, but of a different AD patient. c, Pathway schematic of
  innate immune response to cdsRNA in AD leading to the expression of ISGs. d, Bubble
  chart of upregulated ISGs within relevant brain regions in AD patients. Each red
  bubble represents a gene. Bubble size is proportional to fold change of upregulation.
  Chart is based on a differential gene analysis of RNA-sequencing data derived from
  the ROSMAP and MSBB databases comparing AD patients and healthy controls. Individual
  gene names are shown in . DFPC: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; FP: frontal pole;
  IFG: inferior frontal gyrus; PHG: parahippocampal gyrus; STG: superior temporal
  gyrus. Patient information of human postmortem brain sections that are depicted
  in this figure can be found in .'
