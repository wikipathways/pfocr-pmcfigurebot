caption: Different signaling pathways and epigenetic mechanisms that have been deregulated
  during TNBC progression and growth, contributing to stemness. Tyrosine kinase receptors
  promote tumorigenesis through Ras and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. ERK phosphorylation,
  the activation of STAT, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway promote EMT, and regulate
  the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. The activation of NF-κβ
  and the SMAD pathway promote the survival and self-renewal of genes. In the cytoplasm,
  the androgen receptor (AR) binds with the chaperone proteins and undergoes phosphorylation,
  which promotes the transcription of target genes in the nucleus. Within the nucleus,
  at the genetic level, the BRCA1/2, and p53 mutation, promote TNBC progression. PD-1/PD-L1
  signaling suppresses CD8+ T activation, which in turn results in a tumor microenvironment
  and decreases tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The inactivation of PTEN, and FOXO,
  promote the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
