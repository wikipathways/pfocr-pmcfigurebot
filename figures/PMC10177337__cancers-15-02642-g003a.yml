caption: '(A) The effect of KV on TMEM139 protein, the TMEM139-associated signaling
  pathway, and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in oxaliplatin-resistant AsPC-1
  cells. Oxaliplatin-resistant AsPC-1 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations
  of KV for 48 h, and the protein expression level of TMEM139 protein, the TMEM139-associated
  signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway was determined by Western
  blotting. α-tubulin was used as an internal control. (B) Protein–protein interaction
  (PPI) for TMEM139 from the search tool (STRING) database. Interacting proteins for
  TMEM139 (Transmembrane 139) Gene: MAPK3/1 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/1;
  Erk1/2)-RPS6KA3 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase A3)-TMEM139 (C) Protein–protein interaction
  (PPI) for PI3K-Akt and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway from the search tool (STRING)
  database. Interacting proteins for Akt1 (AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase) gene: PI3K-Akt
  and PI3K-Akt-mTOR'
