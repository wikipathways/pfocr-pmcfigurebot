figure_title: scPHD2 inhibited the HIF-1 signaling pathway.
caption: 'scPHD2 inhibited the HIF-1 signaling pathway. (A) The scHIF-1 signaling
  pathway was inhibited by scPHD2. When the MFF-1 cells reached approximately 70%
  confluency, they were used for transfection. Four treatments were designed: 0.2
  μg pGL4-HREs-luc + 0.2 μg pCMV-Flag + 0.2 μg pCMV-Myc + 0.02 μg pRT-TK; 0.2 μg pGL4-HREs-luc
  + 0.2 μg Flag-scHIF-1α + 0.2 μg pCMV-Myc + 0.02 μg pRT-TK; 0.2 μg pGL4-HREs-luc
  + 0.2 μg Flag-scHIF-1α + 0.2 μg Myc-scPHD2 + 0.02 μg pRT-TK; 0.2 μg pGL4-HREs-luc
  + 0.2 μg pCMV-Flag + 0.2 μg Myc-scPHD2 + 0.02 μg pRT-TK. Luciferase activity was
  measured after 24 h. Firefly luciferase activity value was compared with Renilla
  luciferase activity. The y-axis represents the relative luciferase activities. Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD from three independent triplicated experiments. **,
  p < 0.01 versus the controls. (B) Increased scPHD2 inhibited the scHIF-1 signaling
  pathway in a dose-dependent manner. MFF-1 cells were transfected with either Flag-scHIF-1α
  or increasing doses of Myc-scPHD2, and the firefly luciferase activity value was
  compared with Renilla luciferase activity. Flag-scHIF-1α and Myc-scPHD2 expression
  were analyzed by Western blotting after 24 h of transfection (right image). Data
  are presented as the mean ± SD from three independent triplicate experiments. **,
  p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05 versus the controls. (C–E) Expression patterns of scvegf,
  scldha, and scglut-1 genes determined by RT-qPCR after cells were overexpressed
  with scHIF-1α and scPHD2. The β-actin served as an internal control. The y-axis
  represents the relative mRNA expression. Asterisks above bars represent statistically
  significant differences among the control samples. **, p < 0.01'
