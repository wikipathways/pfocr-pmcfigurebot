caption: (a) Phylogenetic tree of putative AQ-VHPOs identified in this study. Tree
  is color coded by the Class of the source bacterium that the VHPO is derived from.
  Gammaproteobacteria is further split into Orders due to the large number of gammaproteobacterial
  source species. Previously characterized AQ-brominating HZ11-VHPO (black star)11
  and the 13 novel AQ-VHPOs further explored in this study (red stars) are indicated.
  Distinct phylogenetic regions (1â€“3) are labeled. Bootstrap values have been removed
  for visual clarity. (b) The genomic contexts of 13 AQ-VHPOs (red arrow) selected
  to represent the diversity of microbial taxonomy and source environments identified
  in this study. Putative gene functions were defined based on COG definitions, classified
  into one of five general categories, and color coded accordingly. Shaded blocks
  connecting the arrows represent a percent sequence identity of 30%. (c) Heat map
  visualization of the general absence of alkyl quinolone biosynthetic pathways in
  species containing AQ-VHPOs, using either the P. aeruginosa (left) or Microbulbifer
  sp. HZ11 (right) pqsABCDE genes
