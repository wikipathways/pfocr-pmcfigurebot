caption: Transcriptome analysis of urine-derived podocytes stimulated with ANG II
  and losartan. Comparative transcriptome and Gene Ontology analysis of urine-derived
  UM51 podocytes stimulated with 100 μM ANG II with and without 1 μM losartan. Expressed
  genes (det-p < 0.05) in UM51 derived podocytes treated with 100 μM ANG II and with
  and without 1 μM losartan compared in the Venn diagram (A) show distinct (1243 in
  podocytes only treated with 100 μM ANG II; 106 in podocytes treated with the combination
  of 100 μM ANG II and 1μM losartan) gene expression patterns. We found 13,131 genes
  to be expressed in common between podocytes treated with 100 μM ANG II and podocytes
  treated with the combination of 100 μM ANG II and 1 μM losartan. Podocytes treated
  with the combination of 100 μM ANG II and 1 μM losartan showed the most over-represented
  GO BP-terms associated with extracellular matrix organization, metal ion transport,
  DNA methylation or demethylation, and regulation of cytokine production involved
  in inflammatory response and response to cAMP (B,D). KEGG pathway analyses revealed,
  for example, protein digestion and absorption, pancreatic secretion, and primary
  immunodeficiency (C)
