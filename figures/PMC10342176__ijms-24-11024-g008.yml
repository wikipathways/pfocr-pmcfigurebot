caption: Diagram of the proposed functional mechanism of GmSSP. The dysfunction or
  absence of this protein affects many pathways, e.g., ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
  and plant hormone signal transduction (GA, CK, auxin, and BR). Hence, developmental
  processes, such as cell division, cell differentiation, and cell elongation, are
  severely affected in a tissue-specific manner, affecting a variety of tissues and
  growth processes in different ways. Super-short petioles might result from dysfunction
  of the GA signaling pathway
