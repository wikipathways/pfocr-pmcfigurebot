caption: Larger numbers of phosphosites annotated to the MAPK signaling pathway were
  affected by the anisomycin treatment and by the expression of the constitutively
  active variants of p38α and p38β. (A) Identified phosphorylation sites in cells
  expressing p38α or p38β molecules and in anisomycin-treated cells (Supplementary
  Table S1); (B) the anisomycin treatment induced larger changes in the numbers and
  levels of phosphorylations. Phosphorylation sites were those affected by more than
  1.5-fold due to the presence of the active variants or due to the anisomycin treatment
  at 5 min; (C) these phosphorylation sites included many sites in proteins belonging
  to the MAPK signaling pathway; (D) phosphosites affected in the p38α and p38β experiments
  by more than 1.5-fold relative to the wild-type variants of p38α and p38β, including
  72 sites that changed in an opposite direction
