figure_title: Maternal postpartum week 1 metabolome vs calibrated vitamin D level.
caption: Maternal postpartum week 1 metabolome vs calibrated vitamin D level. (A)
  OPLS Y score plot where separation with calibrated vitamin D level (adjusted for
  vitamin D intervention, fish oil intervention, offspring sex, smoking during third
  trimester, and birth season) is maximized along the predictive component (x-axis),
  while the orthogonal component accounts for intragroup variability (y-axis). Color
  of each dot (each sample) represents levels of calibrated vitamin D level; intense
  red indicates relatively higher vitamin D level. Permutation test (n = 1000) showed
  no significance in the model (P > .05). (B) Linear regression models summarized
  into a volcano plot. Each dot represents a metabolite; different colors indicate
  metabolic super-pathways in which metabolites are involved. The x-axis indicates
  change in metabolite level (per SD) with calibrated vitamin D level (nmol−1), while
  the y-axis indicates association strength in terms of −log10 of P value. (C) Bar
  chart showing VIP score based on the predictive component from (A) for each metabolite.
  The x-axis represents each metabolite; different colors indicate the metabolic super-pathways
  in which metabolites are involved. The y-axis represents OPLS Y VIP score from its
  predictive component. Horizontal line indicates OPLS Y VIP score of 2 (metabolite
  number above this threshold, n = 46). (D) Pathway enrichment analysis based on metabolites
  with VIP score >2. The y-axis indicates the metabolic sub-pathway name, while the
  x-axis indicates logarithm of the enriched factor in each pathway. The bubble size
  and color indicate the P value. Cali, Calibrated; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; VitD,
