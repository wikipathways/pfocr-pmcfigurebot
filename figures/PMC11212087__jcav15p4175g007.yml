caption: Cell communication analysis to assess crosstalk between malignant cells and
  tumor microenvironment cells. (A) Dot plots display gene expression levels of receptor-ligand
  pairs involved in interactions between TME and tumor clusters. (B) Overall number
  of interactions and crosstalk of tumor subpopulations with fibroblasts, macrophages
  and T reg cells, respectively. (C) Circle plots showing the interactions of MK,
  WNT, BMP, VEGF classical tumour-associated signalling pathways. (D) Malignant cells
  with a low expression of metabolic pathways associated with favorable prognosis
  are often accompanied by greater infiltration of Treg and fibroblasts, while promoting
  neovascularisation and metastasis
