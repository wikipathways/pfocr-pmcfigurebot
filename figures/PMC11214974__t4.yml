caption: 'GA alleviated LPS-induced Caco-2 cell apoptosis(A) Caco-2 cells were first
  treated with 5 μg/mL GA and then with 10 μg/mL LPS in 6-well plates, subsequently
  stained with Annex V-FITC and analyzed by flow cytometry. qRT-PCR was used to quantify
  the mRNA expression levels of (B) Caspase-3, (C) Casepase-8, (D) Caspase-9, (E)
  Bax, (F) Bad, and (G) Bcl-2. Data are presented as the mean±SEM, n=6. *P<0.05 and
  **P<0.01 compared to the control. #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 compared to the LPS group.
  GA: gallic acid.'
article_title: Gallic acid attenuates LPS-induced inflammation in Caco-2 cells by
  suppressing the activation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway.
