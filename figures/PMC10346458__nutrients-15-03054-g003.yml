  contents.
caption: 'PS pretreatment altered gut microbiota-related metabolites in colonic contents.
  (a) Score scatter plot from PCA model of intestinal contents samples in each group
  of mice described in Figure 1a. n = 6â€“7 mice per group. (b) Histogram plot of KEGG
  metabolic pathway enrichment analysis for group 2.5%DSS + PBS versus water + PBS
  or 2.5%DSS + PS-L/H versus 2.5%DSS + PBS intestinal contents from (a). The color
  depth and column height indicate uncorrected p-value and the impact of the pathway.
  (c) Overview of arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. (d) VIP-score analysis of differential
  metabolites enriched in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway for group 2.5%DSS
  + PBS versus water + PBS, 2.5%DSS + PS-L or 2.5%DSS + PS-H versus 2.5%DSS + PBS.
  (Left) Metabolite-clustering dendrogram: the color depth indicates the relative
  expression. (Right) Metabolite VIP bars: the bar length signifies the extent to
  which the metabolite contributes to the disparity between the two groups; the bar
  color depth calculated from -log10 (p-value) indicates the significance of difference
  (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). (e) Correlation analysis for selected
  differential metabolites showed in (d) with differential species obtained in Figure
