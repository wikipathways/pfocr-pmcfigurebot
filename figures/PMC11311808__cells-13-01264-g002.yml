figure_title: Genetic and Signalling pathway dysregulation in AC.
caption: 'Genetic and Signalling pathway dysregulation in AC. (A): Desmosomes play
  a crucial role in cell adhesion, mechanical anchorage, and communication between
  cardiomyocytes. (B): The desmosome structure consists of several proteins: Desmoplakin
  (DSP), Plakoglobin (JUP), and Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) form the intracellular portion,
  separated into an outer and inner dense plaque, while the intercellular portion
  is characterized by the interaction between cadherin proteins, Desmoglein-2 (DSG2),
  and Desmocolin-2 (DSC2). (C): The dysregulation of signalling pathways is fundamental
  in the progression of the disease. Wnt/β-catenin dysregulation occurs through desmosome
  destabilization and subsequent JUP protein release, leading to adipogenesis and
  fibrogenesis. The activation of the Hippo/YAP-TAZ pathway leads to the accumulation
  p-YAP in the cytosol, its degradation and the subsequent altered gene expression
  associated with adipogenesis and apoptosis. p-YAP also binds and sequesters β-catenin,
  reducing its transcriptional activities. The upregulated TGF-β signalling pathway
  contributes to cardiac repair, remodelling, and fibrosis. Image created with Biorender'
