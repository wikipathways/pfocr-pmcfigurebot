figure_title: Distribution of KEGG pathway enrichment.
caption: 'Distribution of KEGG pathway enrichment. (a): Asn vs. Asp and Jsn vs. Jsp,
  (b): Asn vs. Jsn and Asp vs. Jsp. The x-axis indicates the enrichment factor of
  the corresponding pathway, and the y-axis indicates the KEGG pathway name. Different
  colors of the dots indicate padj, and the number of DEGs in each pathway is indicated
  by the size of the dot'
