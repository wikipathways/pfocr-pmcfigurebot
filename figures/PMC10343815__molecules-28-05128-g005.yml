caption: The differentially expressed genes in the cAMP metabolic pathway suggested
  that upregulated genes were dominant in this pathway. All the highlighted genes
  in the figure belong to the genes annotated in this transcriptome. The colors indicate
  the relative upregulation/downregulation relationship between the genes in the two
  comparison samples. Red indicates upregulated genes, green indicates downregulated
  genes, and yellow indicates nondifferentially expressed genes. The depth of the
  color indicates the magnitude of the upregulation or downregulation, and the darker
  the color, the greater the magnitude
