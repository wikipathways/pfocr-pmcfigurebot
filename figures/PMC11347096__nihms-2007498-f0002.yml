figure_title: Phospholipids and their binding proteins mediate normal or malignant
  B cell activation.
caption: Phospholipids and their binding proteins mediate normal or malignant B cell
  activation. The B cell receptor (BCR) stimulated with antigen activates BCR signaling
  pathway by recruiting SYK and PI3K to CD19, a co-receptor of BCR. The lipid raft-localized
  PI3K transiently synthesizes phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) at
  the expense of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) that is stabilized and
  concentrated by IFITM3 near the BCR signalosome. Consequently, IFITM3 promotes the
  PIP3-mediated recruitment of downstream effector molecules such as BTK and AKT,
  thereby enhancing PI3K/AKT signaling. On the other hand, lipid raft-anchored PLCγ
  hydrolyzes PIP2 into DAG and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG facilitates
  the translocation of PKC from the cytoplasm to the lipid raft. Concurrently, the
  IP3-mediated influx of Ca2+ enables Ca2+ binding to the regulatory domain of PKC,
  subsequently releasing the catalytic activity of PKC. PKC-mediated activation of
  NF-ºB signaling is crucial for the proliferation and survival of normal or malignant
  B cells. Oncogenic lesions in B cell malignancy frequently mimic the active BCR
  signaling pathway
