caption: mTOR inhibitor blocks LGMN-induced polarization of macrophages from M1 to
  M2 phenotype. (A) Flow cytometry analysis of the effect of AZD2014 on LGMN-mediated
  polarization of macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype. (B) Western blot analysis of
  the effect of AZD2014 on upregulation of mTORC2 signaling pathway activity by rh-LGMN
  in M1 macrophages. (C) Western blot analysis of the effect of rh-LGMN on mTORC1
  signaling pathway activity in M1 macrophages
