figure_title: L-BAIBA activates Gαs and Gαq proteins, while D-BAIBA activates the
  Gαi protein
caption: (A) RT-qPCR analysis of Fgf23 mRNA in day-28 IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM L-BAIBA
  in the presence of melittin, a Gαs inhibitor (left), ebselen, a Gαq inhibitor (middle),
  or pertussis toxin, a Gαi inhibitor (right). 100 nM melittin and ebselen blocked
  L-BAIBA-induced Fgf23 mRNA expression but not pertussis toxin. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) are calculated using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons.(B) RT-qPCR analysis of Sost mRNA in day-28 IDG-SW3 treated with 10
  μM D-BAIBA in the presence of melittin (left), ebselen (middle), or pertussis toxin
  (right). 10 ng/mL pertussis toxin blocked D-BAIBA-induced Sost mRNA expression,
  but neither melittin nor ebselen did. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological
  replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) are calculated using
  two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(C) cAMP production in day-28 IDG-SW3
  treated with BAIBA enantiomers. Upon 10 μM L-BAIBA treatment cAMP increased after
  3 h, peaked at 6 h, and maintained that level for up to 24 h. In contrast, 10 μM
  D-BAIBA decreased cAMP at 6 h but not at other time points. Data are presented as
  mean ± SD (n =3 biological replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01) are calculated using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons.(D)
  BAIBA signaling pathway. L-BAIBA utilizes Gαs and Gαq coupled to MRGPRD while Gαi
  is utilized by D-BAIBA. cAMP was upregulated by L-BAIBA whereas it was inhibited
  by D-BAIBA with different response timing. Melittin is an inhibitor for Gαs, ebselen
  for Gαq, and pertussis toxin for Gαi, used in this study
