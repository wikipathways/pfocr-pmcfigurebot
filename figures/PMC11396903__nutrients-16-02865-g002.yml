figure_title: Involvement of NMDA in ABCA1 promoter activity in INS-1 cells.
caption: 'Involvement of NMDA in ABCA1 promoter activity in INS-1 cells. (A) ABCA1
  promoter activity in INS-1 cells treated with various concentrations of NMDA (0,
  0.01, 0.1, and 1 mM). (B) ABCA1 promoter activity in INS-1 cells treated with NMDA
  and MK801. (C) Various effects on ABCA1 promoter activity in the absence of NMDA
  after treatment with inhibitors of different signaling pathway components (PD for
  MEK, H-89 for PKA, LY for PI3K, and SB for p38 MAPK). The percentage of promoter
  activity was compared to that of the control cells. N.S., not significant. (D) Varying
  effects on ABCA1 promoter activity following treatment with 1 mM NMDA or inhibitors
  of different signaling pathways. (Eâ€“G) Phosphorylation of MEK at Ser 217/221 and
  ERK at Thr 202/Tyr 204 in INS-1 cells treated with NMDA (E,F) and without NMDA (G)
  (* p < 0.05 compared to control; # p < 0.05 compared to NMDA)'
