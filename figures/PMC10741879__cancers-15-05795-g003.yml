figure_title: Lactate induced M2-like polarization by activating the AKT/ERK pathway
  in macrophages.
caption: 'Lactate induced M2-like polarization by activating the AKT/ERK pathway in
  macrophages. (A,B) mRNA expression of M2 macrophage markers (CD86, IL-6, TGF-β,
  and CD301) in CM-stimulated THP-1 macrophages for 24 h. (C) Representative images
  of immunofluorescence in CM-treated macrophages for 24 h. (D) Protein expression
  of the AKT-ERK pathway in culture medium or M-CSF-treated THP-1 macrophages for
  24 h. (E) Protein expression of the AKT-ERK pathway in lactate-treated THP-1 macrophages
  for 24 h. (F) Concentration of lactate in RKO cells treated with blank control,
  CM3, or CM3 + Oxamate. (G) Protein expression of the AKT-ERK pathway in THP-1 stimulated
  with CM3, CM3 + Oxamate, lactate, or Oxamate for 24 h. ((H,I) Representative images
  and tumor weight of tumor-mice inoculated with CT26, CT26+LA, CT26 + M0, and CT26
  + M0 + LA. (J) Protein expression of the AKT-ERK pathway in tumor tissues * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. Original western blots are presented in File
  S1. Scale bar: 100 μm'
