caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of expanding (A) and specific (B) gene families
  of B. coli. The genes related to endocytosis, salivary secretion, pancreatic secretion,
  calcium signaling pathway, and the cAMP signaling pathway were significantly enriched
  in B. coli. In the histogram, the horizontal coordinate is the number of genes under
  this pathway, and the bar colors represent the corresponding p values; a lower p
  value refers to more significant enrichment
