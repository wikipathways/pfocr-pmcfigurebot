caption: Transcriptome analysis of tongue tissues from cloned piglets. (A) Volcano
  plotting analysis of 197 upregulated genes and 139 downregulated genes. (B) Heat
  map analysis from the one-way hierarchical clustering of up and down-regulated DEGs
  using the Euclidean method and complete linkage. (C) Gene ontology (GO) analysis
  to identify biological processes. (D) KEGG pathway analysis. The results of GO and
  KEGG analysis were carried out by using the ShinyGO 0.77 (http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu
  (accessed on 1 March 2023)) with selection by FDR and sorting by fold enrichment.
