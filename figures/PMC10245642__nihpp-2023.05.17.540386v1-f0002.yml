figure_title: CYCLOPS reconstructed rhythms in non-cancerous human breast samples
caption: CYCLOPS was used to estimate sample circadian phase in non-cancerous human
  breast tissue. Some samples were newly collected in Manchester, UK (N = 26). Most
  data were obtained from GTEx (N = 167) and TCGA (N =106).(A) Inferred time of peak
  transcript expression phase (acrophase) is plotted for select core clock genes in
  non-cancerous human breast (outer, blue). The acrophases for the mouse paralogues
  (averaged across mouse tissues) are shown in the inner circle (inner, orange). In
  the mouse, time 0 was defined by the peak time of Arntl (Bmal1) expression. Rhythmicity
  for the transcripts shown was assessed by modified cosinor regression. All transcripts
  in blue had a regression p-statistic < 0.05. The Human ordering was aligned to match
  the mouse acrophases.(B) Histogram of inferred sample collection phase for non-cancerous
  GTEx (filled) and TCGA (outlined) data. Sample phases are aligned as in (A).(C)
  Optimal alignment of CYCLOPS-predicted sample phases for the subset of time-stamped
  samples collected in Manchester ().(D) Histogram of transcript acrophases including
  all significantly cycling transcripts in non-cancerous breast tissue (BHq < 0.05).(E)
  Transcript expression was fit using cosinor regression in a model that included
  batch collection site. Batch-adjusted transcript expression is plotted as a function
  of CYCLOPS-predicted sample phase. The best-fit sinusoid is superimposed, and fit
  significance is shown for each transcript. Fit significance is assessed by modified
  cosinor regression. Solid lines represent a significant cosinor fit (BHq < 0.05).(F)
  Phase set enrichment analysis (PSEA) was applied to CYCLOPS ordered non-cancerous
  human breast data. MSigDB hallmark gene sets exhibiting phase-coordinated expression
  are shown. Gene sets graphed furthest from the center of the circle had the most
  significant phase coordination. Gene sets highlighted in yellow also demonstrated
  phase coordination in mouse mammary tissue.(G) EnrichR was used to identify MSigDB
  Hallmark gene sets overrepresented among informatically identified cycling genes
  in human non-cancerous breast (BHq < 0.05, relative amplitude > 0.33). The significance
  of pathway overrepresentation (log BHq) is plotted against the significance of pathway
  phase coordination identified by PSEA (log BHq).(H) Transcripts were ranked by cosinor
  regression F statistic. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to the ranked
  list. Hallmark gene sets with BHq < 0.1 are shown.
