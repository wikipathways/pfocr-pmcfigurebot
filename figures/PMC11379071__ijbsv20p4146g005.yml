caption: METTL3 mediates LATS2 mRNA instability and expression via m6A modification.
  (A) Corresponding KEGG pathways were identified according to the significant genes
  with upregulated m6A methylation. (B) The relative m6A enrichment levels of the
  LATS2 mRNA 5′UTR were verified via meRIP-qPCR analysis in HepG2 and HUH6 cells.
  (C-E) The mRNA expression of LATS2 (C), the protein expression of METTL3, YAP1,
  p-YAP1, and LATS2 (D), and the relative m6A enrichment of LATS2 (E) were measured
  with or without METTL3 knockdown. (F-H) The mRNA expression of LATS2 (F), the protein
  expression of METTL3, YAP1, p-YAP1, and LATS2 (G), and the relative m6A enrichment
  of LATS2 (H) were measured in cells with or without METTL3 overexpression. (I and
  J) The decay rate of LATS2 mRNA was detected via qRT-PCR at the indicated time points
  after METTL3 knockdown (I) or overexpression (J) in HUH6 and HepG2 cells treated
  with ActD (5 μg/ml). (K) The m6A levels of the WT and Mut pmir-GlO plasmids were
  verified by MeRIP-qPCR. (L and M) Luciferase activities of the WT and Mut pmir-GlO
  plasmids were measured after METTL3 knockdown (L) or overexpression (M) in HepG2
  and HUH6 cells. All quantitative data are presented as the mean ± SD from three
  independent experiments. WT, wild-type; Mut, mutation; n.s., no significant difference;
  **p <0.01, ***p <0.001, ****p <0.0001
