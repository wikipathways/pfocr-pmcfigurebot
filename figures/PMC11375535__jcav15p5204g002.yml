caption: Identification and evaluation of m6A Subtypes based on 23 MRGs in TCGA-BLCA
  cohort. (A) Difference analysis of mRNA expression level of 23 MRGs between BLCA
  and normal bladder tissue. (B) Log-rank test of single-gene K-M survival analysis
  based on optimal cutoff value grouping. The larger the sphere, the smaller the p-value.
  Red represents prognostic risk factors and purple represents prognostic protective
  factors. (C) Unsupervised consensus clustering divides BLCA samples into two clusters
  (k=2) based on 23 MRGs. (D-E) OS curves (D) and PFS curves (E) for the two subtypes
  of patients with BLCA. (F) Expression differences analysis of 23 MRGs between the
  two subtypes. (G-H) PCA (G) and tSNE (H) show a significant difference in transcriptomes
  of MRGs between the two subtypes. (I) GSVA between the two subtypes with the metabolic
  pathway gene sets in KEGG. The color of the bar represents the GSVA score. ns, no
  significant difference; *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001
