figure_title: Spatial transcriptomic changes observed in glomeruli from patients with
  class 4 lupus nephritis
caption: '(A) Representative coimmunofluorescent staining of nephrin/p-AKTSer473 (frozen
  section) and nephrin/p-S6RP in kidney biopsies from patients with lupus nephritis
  (LN), ANCA vasculitis, or controls (n = 4 patients per group). (B) Glomerular p-AKTSer473
  and p-S6RP quantification (n = 4 patients per group). (C) GSEA mapping from the
  Reactome database for LN versus controls. Some of the pathways of interest that
  are enriched in LN samples are highlighted in colored dots as follows: inflammation
  related in yellow, metabolism related in magenta, pluripotency related in orange,
  extracellular matrix organization related in green, DNA replication and protein
  translation related in light blue, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway related in navy
  blue. Gray circles indicate “other.” (D) Volcano plot between controls and LN samples.
  Significantly differentially expressed genes are indicated by red dots. FC, fold
  change. (E) Bar plot of the top normalized enrichment score–ranked gene sets (Hallmark,
  GSEA) with P < 0.001 in LN p-AKT activity–high kidneys compared with LN p-AKT activity–low
  ROIs. (F) Volcano plot between the LN p-AKT activity–high and LN p-AKT activity–low
  ROIs. Significantly differentially expressed genes are indicated by red dots. Data
  are represented as mean ± SD, and P values were calculated using 1-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s post hoc test (B). Scale bars: 20 μm (A)'
