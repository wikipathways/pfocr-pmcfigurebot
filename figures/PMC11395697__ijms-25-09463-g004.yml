caption: Model of the colitis-associated cancer pathway in inflammatory bowel disease.
  The figure depicts the multistage process by which chronic intestinal inflammation
  can lead to colorectal carcinoma development in the context of inflammatory bowel
  disease. The pathway is initiated by recurrent episodes of mucosal injury and inflammation
  in conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD). Prolonged
  inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine/growth factor release results in accumulation
  of DNA damage and mutations in genes such as tumor suppressors (e.g., TP53) and
  oncogenes involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Epigenetic alterations including
  DNA methylation changes also occur. This contributes to dysregulated epithelial
  proliferation and dysplasia. Immune system modulation favors an immunosuppressive
  microenvironment conducive to tumor growth. Through additional genetic and epigenetic
  changes, low- and high-grade dysplasia may develop, eventually progressing to adenocarcinoma,
  squamous cell carcinoma, or small cell carcinoma subtypes—the colitis-associated
  cancers (CAC). Figure created using BioRender
