caption: Schematic representation of NXN-regulated signaling pathways. (A) NXN negatively
  regulates WNT signaling by binding to DVL, but its oxidation activates GSK3β and
  the downstream signaling through β-catenin stabilization and nuclear translocation.
  (B) NXN/DVL binding oxidation induces the recruitment of DVL, phosphatidylinositol
  4-kinase type-IIα (PI4KII), and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5KI)
  to Frizzled/WNT complex, stimulates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] production,
  and after producing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], Amer1/Axin/GSK3β/CK1γ
  clustering and the subsequent phosphorylation of LRP6 is promoted. (C) Rac1 activation
  by WNT/β-catenin pathway induces generation of NOX1-derived ROS, which oxidizes
  and dissociates NXN from DVL. The last, suppresses GSK3β activity resulting in β-catenin
  stabilization and translocation into the nucleus. (D) NXN could be oxidizing and
  stabilizing the SEC63-dependent complex and contribute to co-translational protein
  translocation into endoplasmic reticulum (ER). (E) After lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
  stimulus, MYD88 is recruited to TLR4, which leads to IκB degradation and then, NF-κB
  moves into the nucleus to activate gene transcription. Upon activation of TLR4,
  H2O2 is produced leading to the oxidation of some NXN molecules; however, NXN also
  forms complex with FLII and MYD88 (FLII/NXN/MYD88) to avoid the unnecessary hyperactivation
  of TLR4/MYD88 signaling. (F) By interacting with FLII, it is likely that NXN forms
  a complex with nuclear receptors (NR) and participates in chromatin the remodeling
  process, as well as, contributes to the transcription initiation of NR-targeted
  genes. NXN interaction with PFK1 and PP2A could be associated with TIGAR and Akt
  signaling pathways, respectively; and NXN/CAMK2A interaction has not been linked
  yet with the participation of a specific signaling pathway, as described below.
