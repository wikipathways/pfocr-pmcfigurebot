caption: Activation of the MDA5 regulatory pathway by the rH3N2ΔNS1 virus. MDCK cells
  were infected with different doses (MOI = 0.01, MOI = 0.05, MOI = 0.1) of the recombinant
  viruses rH3N2 and rH3N2ΔNS1. The relative mRNA expression levels of RLR family members
  (MDA5, LGP2, and RIG-I), antiviral molecules (TRIM25, Mx, and IPS1), and proinflammatory
  cytokines (IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6) in MDCK cells were determined by RT-qPCR after
  24 h of infection. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc correction
  for multiple comparisons with Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) method.
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001; ns p > 0.05. Error bars
  indicate the mean (±SD) of 3 independent experiments
