  apoptosis.
caption: HAS-2-shRNA activates the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and promotes chondrocyte
  apoptosis. C28/I2 cells were transduced with HAS-2-shRNA or HAS-2-scrambled. The
  cells were harvested after 48 h, and the mRNA expression levels of (A) RhoA, (B)
  ROCK1 and (C) ROCK2, and (D) their protein expression levels were evaluated using
  reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. (E) Flow
  cytometric analysis of Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was performed to determine the
  percentages of cells in early and late apoptosis. (F) Results are displayed in a
  histogram. Data are presented as the mean Â± SD from three independent experiments.
