caption: (A) Heatmap comparing the expression of the 1000 most changed transcripts
  in HBEC3-KT cells treated with WSPM compared to the vehicle control, as a function
  of treatment group. (B) Quantitative comparison of normalized enrichment score values
  multiplied by −1 (−1*NES) from pathway/GSEA of HBEC3-KT cells treated with vehicle
  (cell culture medium + 0.2% DMSO), WSPM (10 μg/cm2), Vasaka tea (1.25 mg/mL), or
  WSPM and Vasaka tea. Differential gene expression was determined using hciR and
  DESeq2 (1.30.1). Pathway analysis was performed using fgsea (1.18.0) using the Hallmarks
  Molecular Signatures Database. A negative value indicates enrichment in the comparison
  control group
