figure_title: Biochemical map of ROS production.
caption: 'Biochemical map of ROS production. Arrows in circles that point down indicate
  a decrease in ROS production. Arrows pointing up indicate an increase in ROS production.
  The tilde denotes an ambiguous effect on ROS production. The arrows inside the circles
  describe the main participants in the metabolic pathway, leading to either an increase
  or decrease in ROS production. Arrows pointing away from the circles: arrows that
  induce ROS production are indicated in red; arrows that inhibit the production of
  ROS are indicated in blue; arrows that have ambivalent properties are indicated
  in green (on the one hand they induce, on the other hand they inhibit. Biochemical
  elements of inflammation: AC—amino acid; IGF1—insulin-like growth factor 1; Gly—glycine;
