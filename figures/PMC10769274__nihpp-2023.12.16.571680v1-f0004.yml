figure_title: Sex differences in the response of microglia and placental macrophages
  to maternal diet-induced obesity
caption: Differentially-expressed genes (DEG) between microglia and placental macrophages
  in fetuses of obese and control dams are shown, calculated separately for male and
  female offspring.A. The number of DEG between obesity-exposed versus control macrophages/monocytes
  is shown as a bar, colored by cell type, and shaded according to sex. * indicates
  p<0.05 difference between male and female as given by a 2x2 contingency table Fishers-exact
  test.B (left). The table considers the total number of DEG in yolk-sac imprint microglia
  (MgYSI) and HBC cell types, that are DEG in male and/or female cells. Genes are
  categorized as either having a fold change in the same direction (sex-consistent)
  or different direction (sex-dimorphic) in males and females.B (right). GO Biological
  process enrichment results for the set of sex-dimorphic and sex-consistent DEG.C.
  Comparison of the top 12 IPA Canonical Pathways that are enriched in both Mg and
  HBC. The sum of the Z-score from the female analysis and male analysis is shown,
  with positive Z-score indicating activation and negative Z-score indicating inhibition.
