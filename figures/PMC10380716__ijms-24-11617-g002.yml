caption: Failed repair PT cells show an inflammatory and oxidative stress transcriptional
  signature and mainly appear in the period of chronic injury. (A) UMAP of 7 different
  PT clusters, including injured S3, injured S1/S2, healthy S1, healthy S2, healthy
  S3, successful repair PT, and failed repair PT. (B) Dot plot of cell type marker
  genes. The color of the dots represents the average expression, and the size of
  the dots represents the average percentage of cells expressing the selected gene.
  (C) The GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) heatmap result shows the top10 differential
  enriched KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways in each PT subtype.
  All pathways shown in this figure occupied significant differences compared with
  other subtypes (p < 0.05). (D) A Sankey diagram shows the results of the PT re-grouping.
  For brevity, the cells with similar features are re-clustered. Healthy S1, healthy
  S2, and healthy S3 are grouped into a new group named healthy PT. Injured S3 and
  injured S1/S2 are grouped into a new group called injured PT. After re-grouping,
  the bar chart (E) shows each kidney sample count in every cell cluster. The different
  colors represent different kidney samples
