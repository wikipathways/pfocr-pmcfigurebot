caption: Effect of A. hookeri extract on the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β via
  PKA and p38 signaling pathways. (A) Inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β analyzed
  via Western blotting with β-actin serving as a loading control. (B) Protein levels
  of GSK3β upstream signaling target genes assessed via Western blotting with β-actin
  serving as a loading control. Quantification of protein level was carried out using
  the ImageJ software. The results are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent
  experiments and analyzed with one-way ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey’s test. AHE,
  Allium hookeri extract; HDPCs, human dermal papilla cells. ** p < 0.01; *** p <
  0.001
