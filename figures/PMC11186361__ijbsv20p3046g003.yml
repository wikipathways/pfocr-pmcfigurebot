figure_title: SAHA inhibits the AKT pathway by upregulating PTEN expression.
caption: SAHA inhibits the AKT pathway by upregulating PTEN expression. (A) volcano
  plot showing differentially expressed genes in SNU-739 cells post SAHA treatment
  (5 μM) for 24 hours. (B) Pathway enrichment analysis of down-regulated genes in
  SAHA treatment cells compared to DMSO treatment cells. (C) Real-time PCR analysis
  of the expression of PTEN, CCND1 and CDKN1A in SAHA treatment cells. (D) Histone
  acetylation in PTEN promoter. SNU-739 cells were treated with SAHA (5 μM) for 12
  hours before being subjected to ChIP assay using anti-acetyl-histone H3K9 (Ac-H3K9)
  antibody followed by qPCR analysis using primers targeting indicated PTEN promoter
  region. (E-F) Western blotting analysis of the downstream of AKT signaling expression
  in SNU-739 and Hepa1-6 cells, which were treated with SAHA in a dose- and time-dependent
  manner. β-actin served as a loading control
