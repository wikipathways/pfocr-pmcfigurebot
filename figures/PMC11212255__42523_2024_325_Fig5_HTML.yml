caption: 'Differential abundance of enzymes involved in A methane and B sulfur metabolism
  in the CON and PEO groups. Enzymes involved in these metabolic modules are shown
  in yellow. The blue text represents enzymes enriched in the PEO group, while the
  red text indicates enzymes enriched or tending to be enriched in the CON group.
  Inside the navy rectangles are the rumen microbiota that play an important role
  in the pathway. *P < 0.1, **P < 0.05, ***P < 0.01. Metabolic modules include: M00567:
  methanogenesis, carbon dioxide to methane, M00563: methanogenesis, methylamine/dimethylamine/trimethylamine
  to methane, M00357: methanogenesis, acetate to methane, M00356: methanogenesis,
  methanol to methane, M00596: dissimilatory sulfate reduction, sulfate to hydrogen
  sulfide (H2S)'
