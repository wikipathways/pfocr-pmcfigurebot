caption: Canonical molecular pathways underlying the initiation and progression of
  proximal colon cancer Proximal colon cancer typically arises from adenoma or serrated
  neoplasia. As depicted in the figure, pathway 1 illustrates the commonly mutated
  genes and molecular pathways involved in the progression from adenoma to carcinoma,
  while pathway 2 represents those associated with the progression from serrated neoplasia
  to cancer. Notably, during the dysplasia stage, the Wnt signaling pathway predominantly
  operates as a key molecular pathway; APC exhibits closer association with carcinogenesis
  mechanisms linked to adenoma, whereas β-catenin is more closely related to those
  associated with serrated neoplasia. In both adenoma and serrated neoplasia stages,
  HER-2 signaling pathway plays significant role. Mutations in NRAS and KRAS are particularly
  relevant to adenoma-associated carcinogenesis, whereas KRAS and BRAF mutations are
  more closely tied to serrated neoplasia. During cancer progression, major molecular
  pathways include EGFR signaling and TGF-β signaling pathways. Among these, SMAD4
  demonstrates stronger correlation with adenoma's carcinogenesis mechanism while
  PIK3CA and PTEN exhibit closer associations with serrated neoplasia's carcinogenesis
  mechanism
