figure_title: Single-cell transcriptomics analysis on influenza pre-vaccination dataset
  highlights monocytes as key drivers of immune metabolic crosstalk
caption: (A) UMAP plot of influenza pre-vaccination PBMC CITE-seq from 20 healthy
  donors. Colors represent cell identity.(B) Heatmap of single-cell gene expression
  values for CD68, bile acid receptors, and PC/PE transporters. Yellow and purple
  denote a higher or lower expression per gene, respectively.(C) Pathway activity
  from each dengue transcriptional module per cell identity from averaged gene expression.
  Each row represents normalized expression per module, while columns represent cell
  identities. Red denotes higher relative expression, while blue represents lower
  expression
