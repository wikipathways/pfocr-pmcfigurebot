caption: Regulation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway by domperidone. (A) Immunoblot
  analysis of proteins involved in the ERK and STAT3 signaling pathways. (B) STAT3
  reporter gene activity in response to domperidone. Values are presented as the mean
  ± standard deviation (SD), (n=3). (C) Immunoblot analysis of proteins involved in
  the ERK and STAT3 signaling pathways in response to the selective MEK inhibitor
  U0126. (D) Immunoblot analysis of cell cycle-related proteins cyclin D1, D2, D3,
  and survivin. (E) HCT116 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting STAT3 or scrambled
  control siRNA for 36 h. Immunoblot analysis of STAT3, cyclin D1, and D2. β-Actin
  was used as the loading control. *p<0.05
