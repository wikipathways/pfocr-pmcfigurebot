caption: Schematic representation of the immune response and its dysregulation by
  metaflammation and SARS-CoV-2. The virus is recognized by pattern recognition receptors
  (PRR). PRRs are located on the membrane and in the cytoplasm. Through the secretion
  of cytokines, the infected cell warns other cells to inhibit virus multiplication
  and spreading (via interferons; IFN-I and -III) and initiate an inflammatory response
  (via inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6). Signal transduction by cytokines
  takes place via a cytokine receptor and the Janus kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator
  of Transcription protein (JAK/STAT) pathway. This pathway creates its own boundary
  by also expressing the proteins “Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 and 3” (SOCS1/3).
  These inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway via negative feedback. Metaflammation is characterized
  by chronic low-grade inflammation. In obesity, the inflamed adipose tissue chronically
  secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, including leptin. Leptin and insulin resistance
  are generated through the inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway by expression of SOCS1/3.
  Therefore, in metaflammation, there is already a brake on cytokine signaling before
  infection. The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 contains codes for non-structural (Nsp) proteins
  and “accessory” proteins. Infected cells express these proteins. They inhibit the
  induction and activation of IFN-I. The virus also causes the expression of SOCS1/3.
  The inhibition of IFN-I signaling by the virus, virus-mediated induction of SOCS1/3,
  and the preexisting elevation of SOCS1/3 in metaflammation, collectively cause late
  and initially weak IFN-I and -III responses, and a strong multiplication and spreading
  of the virus. Major damage is caused by the virus and the immune system. The resulting
  immune system overreaction, cytokine storm and hypercoagulation are hallmarks of
  a severe COVID-19 course.
