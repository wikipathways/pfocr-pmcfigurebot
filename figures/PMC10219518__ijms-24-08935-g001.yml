caption: The figure depicts a simple overview of the SHH signalling pathway. When
  the SHH ligand is absent, PTCH activate SMO, and there is no gene transcription
  (red cross). When the SHH ligand binds to the PTCH protein, PTCH is inhibited and
  leads to SMO inhibition (red cross), which then leads to gene transcription
