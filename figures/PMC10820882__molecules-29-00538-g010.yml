caption: Bioinformatics analysis of the pathogenesis and potential pathways of silicosis.
  (A–C) Volcano plots showing differentially expressed genes in rats exposed to CS
  for 3, 6, and 12 weeks compared to the normal group. (D–F) Gene ontology analysis
  of differentially expressed genes in rats exposed to CS for 3, 6, and 12 weeks.
  (G–I) KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in rats exposed to
  CS for 3, 6, and 12 weeks. (J) Venn diagram showing the enriched pathways. (K) Protein–protein
  interaction network of TNF signaling pathway. (L) The adherens junction pathway
  map of the TNF signaling pathway. Pink rectangles represent target genes involved
  in inflammation resistance
