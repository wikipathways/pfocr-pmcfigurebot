caption: Validation of amplification of Hippo signaling pathway genes in the Dependency
  Map Portal for ovarian cancer cell lines of copy-number variation analysis. Top
  amplified genes were studied in this portal. (Aâ€“F) The results of the DepMap plot
  clearly show that these genes are amplified highly across the ovarian cancer cell
  lines
