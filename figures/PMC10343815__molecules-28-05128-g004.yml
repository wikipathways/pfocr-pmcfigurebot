caption: The gene expression profile of icariin-induced osteoblast differentiation
  in the NF1 cell model was analyzed with RNA-seq technology. (A) Heatmap of the differentially
  expressed genes in the 2−7 group treated with icariin and the 2−7 control group.
  Each row represents a gene, and each column represents a sample. The color indicates
  the level of gene expression in the sample, red indicates higher expression, and
  green indicates lower expression. (B) Scatter plot of differentially expressed genes
  in the comparison groups. Each point in the figure represents a gene, and the point
  closer to the origin has a lower expression. Red represents upregulated genes, green
  represents downregulated genes, and black represents nondifferentially expressed
  genes. Both up/down-regulation are the vertical axis samples relative to the horizontal
  axis samples. (C) Dot-plot of significantly enriched KEGG pathways. The size of
  the q-value is represented by the color of the dots. The smaller the q-value is,
  the closer the color is to the red color, and the number of differentially expressed
  genes contained in each pathway is represented by the size of the dots
