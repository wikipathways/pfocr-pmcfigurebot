caption: Thrombopoietin (TPO) axis and ruxolitinib-related changes in AA mouse model.
  (A) Circulating plasma levels of TPO and its receptor c-MPL from [28] were extracted.
  TPO/c-MPL ratio was calculated for each healthy control (HC), complete (CR), partial
  (PR), and non-responder (NR) group before (pre) and after (post) immunosuppressive
  therapy + eltrombopag, and levels compared by one-way ANOVA. All comparisons corrected
  with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test were statistically significant, except between
  HC and CR post-treatment (p = 0.8303). (B) Putative gene network interactions using
  dysregulated genes in CD8+ T cells from ruxolitinib-treated BMF mice from [51] were
  interpolated by also including HIF-1α, and (C) protein pathways were identified
  by STRING database. ns, not statistically significant
