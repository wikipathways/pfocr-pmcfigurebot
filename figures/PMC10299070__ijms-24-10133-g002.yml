figure_title: Putative mechanisms of transforming growth factor-β1 activation in the
  development of Peyronie’s disease.
caption: Putative mechanisms of transforming growth factor-β1 activation in the development
  of Peyronie’s disease. TGF-β1 is synthesized intracellularly in platelets, fibroblasts,
  and all leukocytes while bound being to LAP, then forms a complex with LTBP or LRRC,
  and is released extracellularly. Released latent TGF-β1 uses LTBP to the ECM to
  anchor LRRC molecules to the cell surface and maintain their inactivated state.
  Several factors, including integrins, thrombospondin 1, ROS, and several proteases
  (plasmin, cathepsin D, MMP-2, MMP-9), activate latent TGF-β1 by inducing LAP degradation,
  denaturation, or conformational changes. Expression of thrombospondin 1 is driven
  by the renin–angiotensin system. Activated TGF-β1 promotes fibrosis by further activating
  the TGF-β signaling pathway in macrophages and myofibroblasts. TGF-β1–transforming
  growth factor-β1; LAP–latency-associated polypeptide; LTBP–latent TGF-β-binding
  protein; LRRC–leucine-rich repeat containing; ECM–extracellular matrix; ROS–reactive
  oxygen species; MMP–matrix metalloproteinase
