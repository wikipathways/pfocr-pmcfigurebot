caption: Venn diagrams were used to count the similarities and differences between
  CTCs type mutation genes in the four samples. From the above CTC differential quantity
  genes (P1_CTC, P2_CTC, P3_CTC, P4_CTC) we screened out 59, 47, 24 and 18 mutated
  genes (A). Among them, cluster analysis showed ABCC6P1 and NBPF1 shared by P2_CTC
  and P3_CTC, METRNL and RPL23AP87 shared by P1_CTC and P3_CTC, RDH12 and TSR2 shared
  by P3_CTC and P4_CTC (B). Venn diagrams were used to count the similarities and
  differences in the KEGG pathway for the specific mutated genes mentioned above.
  Individual differences in the pathways were also significant. From the KEGG analysis
  (P1_CTC, P2_CTC, P3_CTC, P4_CTC) we screened out 90, 58, 25 and 7 pathways (C).
  Among them, cluster analysis showed metabolic pathways shared by P1_CTC, P2_CTC,
  P3_CTC and P4_CTC, HIF-1 signaling pathway shared by P1_CTC, P3_CTC and P4_CTC.
  MAPK signaling pathway and ErbB signaling pathway were also present in the CTC type
  data pathway in the present four samples (D)
