figure_title: Microglial circadian translatomes and reprogramming in WT and APP/PS1
  mice
caption: A. Heatmaps showing transcripts that were rhythmic in WT microglia (upper)
  and rhythmic in microglia from APP/PS1 mice (lower). In both rows of heatmaps, the
  genes plotted are in the same order to compare differences in rhythmic expression
  between mice. B-D. KEGG pathway analysis of microglial transcripts identified as
  rhythmic (by RAIN analysis) in (B) both WT and APP/PS1 mice, (C) WT mice, or (D)
  APP/PS1 mice. E. Heatmap showing temporally-coordinated expression of KEGG proteasome
  pathways genes in microglia from WT mice. F. Radar plot showing acrophase distributions
  of rhythmic microglial transcripts from WT (pink) or APP/PS1 (blue) mice. G. Pie
  chart depicting the number of transcripts that gained or lost rhythms in different
  datasets, based on compareRhythms analysis of rhythmic transcripts in microglia.
  Total of 6399 were identified as rhythmic by RAIN analysis across all datasets.
  H-K. Graphs showing circadian expression patterns of transcripts from microglia
  from WT (blue) or APP/PS1 (red) mice. H. Core clock genes Per2 and Arntl (Bmal1)
  remained rhythmic. I. Iba1-encoding gene Aif1 lost rhythmicity in APP/PS1. J. Microglial
  homeostasis markers Tmem119, P2ry12, and Csfr1 gained rhythmicity in APP/PS1. K.
  Phagocytosis receptor Mertk remained rhythmic. Adjusted P values from RAIN are shown.
  Each datapoint is the average of two mice, each from separate experiments
