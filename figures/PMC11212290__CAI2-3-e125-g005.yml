caption: Collagen subtype‐specific genetic alterations and their impact on the PI3K
  pathway in the TCGA‐STAD cohort. (a) Distribution of TMB between the two collagen
  subtypes. Statistical analysis performed using Wilcoxon's rank sum test. *p < 0.05.
  (b) Comparison of mutated genes between collagen subtypes. Statistical analysis
  performed using Fisher's exact test. p < 0.1, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
  (c) CNV profiles of PIK3 genes between collagen subtypes. Blue represents deletion
  and red represents amplification. (d) Boxplot showing RNA expression of PIK3 genes
  grouped by CNV status of the corresponding gene. Student's t‐test used for comparison.
  *p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001. (e) Comparison of ssGSEA scores for PI3K/Akt pathway
  between overall‐deleted and overall‐amplified patients. Statistical analysis performed
  using Wilcoxon's rank sum test. ***p < 0.001. (f) GSEA plot for PI3K/Akt pathway.
  CNV, copy number variation; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas; TMB, tumor mutational
  burden.
