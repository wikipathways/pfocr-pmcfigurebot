caption: Summary of the poplar defence against two different insects (i.e., spongy
  moth and aphid) obtained from current metabolomic and transcriptomics study. Our
  finding indicates that distinct metabolic pathways and gene expression from key
  physiological pathways in poplar leaves are altered after insect attack, suggesting
  a species-specific, fine-tuned response
