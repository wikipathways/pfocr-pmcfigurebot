figure_title: KEGG analysis results
caption: '(A) KEGG pathway enrichment histogram (top 20). Included are metabolic pathway,
  coronavirus disease, splicesome, actin cytoskeleton, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
  etc. Ordinate: KEGG pathway name; Ordinate: −log10 transformed P-value. The numbers
  in the column represent the Rich Factor values. (B) KEGG pathway concentration statistical
  bubble chart (top 20): including the vitamin digestion, protein export, cortisol
  synthesis, complement and coagulation cascades, nucleocytoplasmic transport, protein
  processing in endoplasmic reticulum, prion disease, pathways of neurodegeneration,
  multiple diseases, pathways in cancer, etc. The ordinate is the KEGG pathway name;
  abscissa: rich factor value; the color of the circle represents the −log10 transformed
  p-value; the darker the color, the smaller the p-value. (C) The KEGG Pathway Enrichment
  Bar Chart presents a series of related metabolic or signaling pathways, such as
  vitamin digestion and absorption, protein export cortisol synthesis and secretion,
  complement and coagulation cascades, cholesterol metabolism, nucleocytoplasmic transport,
  spliceosome, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, nicotinate and nicotinamide
  metabolism, vascular smooth muscle contraction, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and
  so on.'
