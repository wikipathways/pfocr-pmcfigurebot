figure_title: Mechanisms of rice responses to salt and drought stress.
caption: 'Mechanisms of rice responses to salt and drought stress. This diagram illustrates
  the mechanisms of rice responses to salt and drought stress, emphasizing both unique
  pathways and overlapping mechanisms. The color coding used is as follows: blue arrows
  and boxes represent pathways and mechanisms specific to salt stress, yellow arrows
  and boxes indicate those unique to drought stress, and green arrows and boxes highlight
  pathways shared by both salt and drought stress responses. This color distinction
  emphasizes the similarities and differences between the two types of stress and
  aids in understanding their interrelations'
