caption: SVHRSP alleviates age-related cognitive deficiency by reducing oxidative
  stress and neuroinflammation. SVHRSP can enhance the expression of the SIRT1 protein,
  reduce P53 activity, promote the nuclear translocation of the NRF2 transcription
  factor, and induce the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD1, NQO1, and
  HO-1 to counteract oxidative stress. Furthermore, SVHRSP inhibits the expression
  of senescence markers P16 and P21 proteins. Additionally, by suppressing NF-κB pathway
  activation, SVHRSP suppresses the release of inflammatory factors IL-1β, TNF-α,
  and IL-6. (The graphical abstract is depicted by Figdraw 2.0.)
