caption: 'GA regulated intestinal inflammation by inhibiting LPS-induced NF-κB activationCaco-2
  cells were treated with 5 μg/mL GA for 24 h and then 10 μg/mL LPS for 4 h for follow-up
  experiments. (A) Western blot analysis was used to measure the protein expressions
  of p65 and p-p65. Quantitative analysis of the p-p65/p65 ratio. (B) The protein
  expression levels of IκB-α and p-IκB-α. Quantitative analysis of the p-IκB-α/IκB-α
  ratio. Data are shown as the mean±SEM, n=3. **P<0.01 compared to the control. #P<0.05
  compared to the LPS group. GA: gallic acid.'
article_title: Gallic acid attenuates LPS-induced inflammation in Caco-2 cells by
  suppressing the activation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway.
