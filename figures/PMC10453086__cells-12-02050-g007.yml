figure_title: Inhibition or depletion of cholesterol also enhances 3D spheroid formation
  across diverse human cell types.
caption: 'Inhibition or depletion of cholesterol also enhances 3D spheroid formation
  across diverse human cell types. (A) Bioinformatics analyses of public databases
  from each human cell type (GSE116574 for iPSCs, GSE174619 for MSCs, and GSE142616
  for A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line) were by GSEA. Significant enrichment and
  downregulation of the cholesterol synthesis pathway genes in human iPSCs, MSCs,
  and A549 cultured in 3D vs. 2D conditions. (B) Phase contrast microscopy of human
  iPSCs, MSCs, and SK-MES-1 lung squamous cancer cell line cultured in 3D conditions
  with Mev (1 μM), MβCD (1.5 mM), or 1.5 mM MβCD + 100 μg/mL cholesterol treatment.
  Scale bar, 100 μm. Bar figures represent quantification of area of 3D spheroids.
  Data are presented as mean ± SEM. ****, p < 0.0001, compared to 3D control or between
  conditions as indicated by bar (C). Summary diagram of results: downregulation of
  cholesterol synthesis pathway with cytoskeletal modulation is uniformly involved
  in 3D spheroid formation of diverse cell types, amplifying the specific biological
  potential of each cell type, as well as further enhancing 3D spheroid-conferred
  antioxidant ability for all cell types'
