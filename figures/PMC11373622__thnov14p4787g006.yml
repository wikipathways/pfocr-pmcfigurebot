caption: IDO1 is upregulated in HNSC, and activation of the IFN-γ-JAK-STAT axis is
  the potential cause for differentiation to IDO1+macrophages. (A) Umap plot showing
  the differentiation trajectory of macrophages and the distribution of each cell
  subset on the trajectory. (B) Comparison of IDO1 expression between tumor (n = 519)
  and normal (n = 44) in TCGA database. (C) The boxes showing the expression distribution
  of IDO1 in PCA (G1), OLK (G2) and OSCC (G3) in GEO data. (D) Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) results showing the enrichment of JAK-STAT gene sets in Macro_IDO1.
  (E) Information flow of feature signaling pathway in different tissues. (F) The
  CellPhoneDB communication analysis demonstrating that IFN-II signaling pathway mediates
  communication between T cells and macrophages in preca-OLK and OSCC. (G) Scatter
  plot showing the correlation between IFNG and IDO1 expression across 4 independent
  datasets with OLK in GEO data. (H) Heatmap showing RAS activity of regulons in macrophage
  subtype predicted by SCENIC
