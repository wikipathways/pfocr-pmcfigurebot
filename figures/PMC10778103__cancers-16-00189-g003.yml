caption: Gene expression analysis revealed induction of p53- and DNA damage repair
  signaling upon combined treatment with doxorubicin and peposertib. (A) Scheme of
  the experimental setup for gene expression analysis in SYO-1 cells using the NanoString
  nCounter® PanCancer panel. (B) Volcano plots highlighting differentially regulated
  genes (red dots) identified by limma upon combination treatment for 24, 72 and 168
  h. The dotted horizontal and vertical lines indicate the adjusted p-value of 0.05
  and log2FC of 1, respectively, whereas the names indicate differentially regulated
  genes identified by at least two methods. (C) Pathway enrichment analysis at 24,
  72 and 168 h. Significantly enriched pathways were identified using Fisher’s exact
  test. Dashed line indicates the enrichment significance of the p-value (0.05). DE
  differentially expressed genes; non-DE not differentially expressed genes. (D) Heatmap
  showing expression levels of selected p53 related genes included in the Nanostring
  nCounter panel. Each column represents one biological replicate
