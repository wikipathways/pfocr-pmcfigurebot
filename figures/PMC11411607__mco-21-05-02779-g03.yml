figure_title: Regulation of HIF signaling pathways by andrographolide.
caption: 'Regulation of HIF signaling pathways by andrographolide. Two conditions
  are associated with the HIF-1 signaling pathway: Normoxia and hypoxia. Under normoxic
  conditions, proline residues on HIF-1α are hydroxylated by the PHD protein, forming
  a binding site for the VHL protein. Subsequently, Ub of HIF-1α is followed by degradation
  of polyubiquitylated HIF-1α in the 26S proteasome. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α
  and HIF-1β form a heterodimer that binds to the HRE on DNA, activating hypoxia-responsive
  gene transcription. HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain;
  VHL, von Hippel-Lindau; HRE, hypoxia responsive element; OH, hydroxylation; Ub,
  ubiquitylation'
