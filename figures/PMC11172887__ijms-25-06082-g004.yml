caption: 'ESCC cell-derived exosomal miR-143-3p induces M2 polarization of macrophages.
  (A) Two representative immunofluorescence images revealing the internalization of
  EvLINK 505-labeled KYSE150 cell-derived exosomes (green) by PMA-treated THP-1 cells.
  (B) Volcano plot showing the differentially expressed genes in THP-1 cells treated
  with exosomes derived from pLV-miR-143-3p and pLV-control-transfected KYSE150 cells.
  (C,D) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealing activation of epithelial mesenchymal
  transition (C) and the TGFβ signaling pathway (D) in THP-1 cells treated with exosomes
  derived from pLV-miR-143-3p-transfected KYSE150 cells. (E) The Metascape enrichment
  analysis for differentially expressed genes in THP-1 cells treated with exosomes
  derived from pLV-miR-143-3p and pLV-control-transfected KYSE150 cells. (F–H) qRT-PCR
  analysis of M1 macrophage markers (iNOS, CD80, and IL1B) expression levels in THP-1
  cells treated with exosomes derived from pLV-miR-143-3p and pLV-control-transfected
  KYSE150, KYSE510, and KYSE180 cells. (I–K) qRT-PCR analysis of M2 macrophage marker
  (ARG1, CD206, and IL10) expression levels in THP-1 cells treated with exosomes derived
  from pLV-miR-143-3p and pLV-control-transfected KYSE150, KYSE510, and KYSE180 cells.
  Abbreviations: ESCC, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate
  13-acetate; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR; UP, upregulated;
  DEG, differentially expressed gene; DOWN, downregulated; ns, not significant. (***:
  p < 0.001, **: p < 0.01, ns: not significant)'
