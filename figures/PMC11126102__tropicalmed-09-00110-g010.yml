figure_title: Effect of asparagusic acid on tissue proliferation and PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway in the lesion–host microenvironment.
caption: Effect of asparagusic acid on tissue proliferation and PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway in the lesion–host microenvironment. (A) The expression of the Ki67 protein
  was detected via immunohistochemistry. Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) A western blot was
  used to detect the expression of PCNA protein. (C) Western blot was used to detect
  the expression levels of MMP2 and MMP9 proteins. (D) Western blot was used to detect
  the expression levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT proteins. ** p < 0.01 compared with the
  Untreated group
