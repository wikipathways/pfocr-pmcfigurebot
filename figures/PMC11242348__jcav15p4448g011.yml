caption: miRNA-146a-5p induced senescence in HCC cells by upregulating members of
  the CHK2 signaling pathway. A. Phosphate kinase antibody chip detection following
  150Î¼M H2O2 pretreatment. Huh7 cell protein lysates that were not pretreated with
  H2O2 (control). Measuring the amount of CHK2 phosphorylation based on the density
  of array pixels. The red box in (A) highlights the chosen proteins. B. Oxaliplatin
  and H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p53 (downstream of CHK2) and CHK2 in aged Huh7
  cells was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. C. Western blot analysis demonstrating
  how exosome transfection with mimic-146a-5p altered the phosphorylation of p53 and
  CHK2 in MHCC-97H cells. D. Western blot analysis demonstrating overexpression of
  IRF7 altered the phosphorylation of p53 and CHK2 in MHCC-97H cells. E. Co-immunoprecipitation
  experiments confirmed the interaction between IRF7 and p21 proteins. F. Immunofluorescence
  assays validated the co-localization of IRF7 and p21 within the nuclei of liver
  cancer cells. *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001; ns P>0.05
