figure_title: Kinetics of recruitment of core components of the BCR signaling pathway
  to CD19
caption: (A) Enrichment pattern heatmap of known components of the BCR signaling pathway
  grouped by pathway.(B) Enrichment profiles of known components of the BCR signaling
  pathway highlighting the distinct patterns of response of each member. Error bars
  represent mean ± SEM of two biological replicates, and dashed gray lines represent
  phospho-marks.(C) Summary of the proteins recruited to CD19 during activation. Time
  is plotted on a log10 scale for better separation of the early time points.(D) Summary
  of phosphorylation within the CD19 microenvironment during activation. Time is plotted
  on a log10 scale for better separation of the early time points. (C) and (D) contain
  the same data as shown in the heatmap in (A) plotted in different ways to highlight
  distinct patterns of response. In all panels, phospho-marks are annotated with the
  protein name followed by “_amino acid position” of the phospho-mark
