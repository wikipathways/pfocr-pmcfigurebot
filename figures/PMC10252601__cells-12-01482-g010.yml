  pathways and upregulates Serine/Arginine-Rich Protein-Specific Kinase 3 (SRPK3)
  and Choline Kinase Beta (CHKB) pathways in veins.
caption: 'Chronic kidney disease (CKD) reprograms protein kinase signal transduction
  pathways and upregulates Serine/Arginine-Rich Protein-Specific Kinase 3 (SRPK3)
  and Choline Kinase Beta (CHKB) pathways in veins. The gene expression changes of
  the kinome (a complete list of 661 kinases encoded in the human genome) in the veins
  of CKD patients were compared to those of non-CKD controls. (A) A schematic diagram
  showed protein kinases and phosphatases. Protein kinases and phosphatases regulate
  biological signals by acting as enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
  in biological organisms. Phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases retransmits
  incoming signals by activating the protein kinases’ substrates. The signal transmission
  will be terminated by the dephosphorylation (inactivation) of their substrates,
  a reaction catalyzed by protein phosphatases. (B) CKD modulates the gene expression
  changes of 47 kinomes with 2 upregulated genes, including SRPK3 and CHKB. The 661
  kinases or kinase-related genes were extracted from PMID: 31289205'
