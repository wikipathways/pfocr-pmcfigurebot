figure_title: Transcriptional changes of CD8+T cells after anti-PD-1 treatment.
caption: Transcriptional changes of CD8+T cells after anti-PD-1 treatment. (A) Grouping
  of CD8+ T cells based on TSTR scores, shown with box and violin plots for exhaustion
  scores (Wilcoxon test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). (B)
  Trends in cytotoxic, exhaustion, and senescence scores about TSTR scores. (C) Trends
  in glucose metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism about
  TSTR scores. (D) UMAP plot showing the distribution of CD8+ T cell subgroup in responsive,
  non-responsive, and untreated patients. (E) Bar graph showing the proportion of
  CD8+ T cell subgroup in responsive, non-responsive, and untreated patients. (F)
  Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the signature of C3_Tn_THEMIS in the TCGA-LIHC
  cohort. (G) Bubble plot showing Top30 marker genes of C3_Tn_THEMIS. (H) GO enrichment
  results for marker genes of C3_Tn_THEMIS. (I) Correlation of CD8A and THEMIS in
  the TCGA-LIHC cohort. (J) UMAP plot illustrating the developmental trajectory of
  non-responsive CD8+ T cells simulated with monocle3. (K) UMAP plot showing the developmental
  trajectory of responsive CD8+ T cells simulated with monocle3. (L) Radar plot showing
  cell type inclination scores for C1_Tn and C3_Tn_THEMIS subgroups. (M) Multicolor
  immunofluorescence staining confirms the presence of THEMIS+ CD8+ T cells in human
  HCC tissues. (N) tumor characteristics of HCC-mouse models after treatment with
  anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-1 combined with AAV-Themis (T-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). (O) Bubble plot showing cell communication between
  cDC1, LAMP3+ cDC3, and various types of CD8+ T cells in the tumor tissue of responsive
  patients. (P) Communication of TIGIT, PDL1, PDL2, and CD40 signaling pathways between
  cDC1 and CD8+ T cells
