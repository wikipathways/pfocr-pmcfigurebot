figure_title: Effects of ECS on the contents of key proteins participating in the
  apoptotic signaling pathway.
caption: Effects of ECS on the contents of key proteins participating in the apoptotic
  signaling pathway. (a) Immunoblotting of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, Bax, and Bcl-2.
  (b–e), illuminating the relative quantification of the p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, Bax,
  and Bcl-2 proteins, respectively. The relative protein contents were normalized
  with β-actin and Group C, shown as grayscale. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.
  (n = 4). For each protein, significant differences are marked by different letters
  (p < 0.05). p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, Bax, and Bcl-2 represent phosphorylated-phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphorylated-protein kinase B/protein
  kinase B, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and B-cell lymphoma gene 2, respectively;
  C, M, EL, and EH represent control, model, low-dose, and high-dose ECS groups (300
  or 600 mg kg−1 of b.w.), respectively
