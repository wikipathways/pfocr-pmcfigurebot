figure_title: Role of TAM receptors in bone health and disease.
caption: 'Role of TAM receptors in bone health and disease. In bone homeostasis, bone
  formation and bone resorption are coupled and tightly regulated. In bone-forming
  osteoblasts, the TAM receptor TYRO3 induces bone formation, whereas activation of
  MERTK limits osteoblastic bone-forming capacity. Additionally, MERTK and TYRO3 promote
  osteoclastogenesis. In osteoporotic bone diseases, MERTK and TYRO3 induce excessive
  osteoclast formation and bone resorption. Activation of MERTK leads to osteoblast
  dysfunction and inhibition of bone formation. In rheumatoid arthritis, TYRO3 induces
  proinflammatory signaling, aggravating the disease. MERTK and AXL induce anti-inflammatory
  pathways, limiting disease progression. MERTK plays a negative role in bone regeneration
  by limiting osteoblastic bone repair and pro-inflammatory response to allow immune
  cell infiltration for the initiation of bone healing. In periodontitis, PROS1 and
  GAS6 suppress proinflammatory signaling, ameliorating the disease. Albeit GAS6 can
  induce osteoclastic bone resorption by increasing the RANKL/OPG ratio, which is
  disease aggravating. Rounded arrows indicate differentiation steps in osteoclastogenesis
  and osteoblastogenesis. Straight arrows and blunt arrows indicate activation and
  blocking, respectively, of different biological functions and disease states. Arrow
