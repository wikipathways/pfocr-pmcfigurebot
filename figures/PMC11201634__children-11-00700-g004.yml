caption: An illustration of the specific Wnt signaling pathway associated inhibitors
  that have been studied in preclinical and clinical trials for pediatric tumors.
  There are various inhibitors such as Porcupine (PORCN) (ETC-1922159, WNT974, RXC004,
  CGX1321) a membrane-bound O-acyl transferase required for palmitoylation of Wnt
  proteins; SHH002-hu1, a humanized antibody targeting FZD7 receptors; 9-ING-41, a
  small molecular inhibitor of GSK-3β; Tankyrase inhibitor (MSC2504877, XAV939); Niclosamide,
  FDA-approved salicyclamide derivative that targets the Wnt/β-catenin pathway; Pyrvinium,
  a quinoline-derived cyanine dye that inhibits Wnt signaling pathway
