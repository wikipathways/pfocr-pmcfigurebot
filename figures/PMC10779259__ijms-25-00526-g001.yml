caption: 'An overview of aged and non-aged seed transcriptomes from both high-vigor
  (HT) and lowvigor (LT) wheat cultivars. (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) of
  aged and non-aged wheat seed transcriptome from both HT and LT cultivars. The four
  groups are: HT seeds without aging (HT 0 h), HT seeds aged for 48 h (HT 48 h), LT
  seeds without aging (LT 0 h), and LT seeds aged for 48 h (LT 48 h). (B) Venn diagram
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups. (C) Hierarchy clustering
  of the key DEGs specifically highly expressed in each group. (D) Top ten enriched
  KEGG pathways of DEGs between non-aged groups (HT 0 h versus LT 0 h). (E) Top ten
  enriched KEGG pathways of DEGs between aged groups (HT 48 h versus LT 48 h)'
