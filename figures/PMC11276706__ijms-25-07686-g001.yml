figure_title: The in vitro stimulation of lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and
  neutrophil-precursor cells.
caption: 'The in vitro stimulation of lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophil-precursor
  cells. Depicted are flow cytometric analyses showing CD69+ (a–c)- and TLR4+ (d–f)-stimulated
  A549, THP1 and HL60 cells. The activation of the NF-kB pathway was detected via
  a Western blot in all three cell lines, showing the comparison of the NF-kB p50
  band in unstimulated and stimulated cells at 50 kDa. YY1 is used as an endogenous
  control for nuclear protein expression (g–i). Further, IL-8 protein expression levels
  were measured by a cytometric bead array (CBA) after cytokine mix (CM4, CM6, and
  CM8) stimulation in A549 (j) and in HL60 cells (l), as well as after M1 differentiation
  in THP1 cells (k). A549: n = 4; THP1: n = 3–8; HL60: n = 3–7. * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001'
