figure_title: The effect of TcCYP6K1 (A) and TcCYP9F2 (B) RNAi on the expression of
  trehalose metabolic pathway-related genes in T.
caption: 'The effect of TcCYP6K1 (A) and TcCYP9F2 (B) RNAi on the expression of trehalose
  metabolic pathway-related genes in T. castaneum under the 75% CO2 condition. TRE,
  trehalase; TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; GS, glycogen synthase; GP, glycogen
  phosphorylase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; HCK1, hexokinase; PK, pyruvate kinase.
  Three biological replicates were performed on 60 larvae of T. castaneum in each
  treatment. Values are presented as the means Â± SE. ***: p < 0.001, **: p < 0.01,
  *: p < 0.05 (independent-samples t-test)'
