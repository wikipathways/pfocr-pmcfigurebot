caption: Effects of different concentrations of SCPs1 on transcription levels of cAMP-CREB
  signaling pathway genes in B16 cells. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression
  levels of TYR, TRP-1, TRP-2, MITF and MC1R in B16 cells. **** p < 0.0001, *** p
  < 0.001, ** p < 0.01 and * p < 0.05 indicate that there is significant difference
  between different treatment methods and the control group
