caption: IL-33 regulated inflammatory signaling pathways in SARS-CoV-2-infectionWT
  B6 and IL-33−/− mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 as indicated in  (n = 3–5 mice/group).
  B6 mice in the mock group were i.n. treated with the same volume of cell culture
  medium. Lungs were perfused with cold PBS and harvested for RNA extraction and RNA-seq
  analysis.(A) Volcano plot describing the fold changes and false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted
  p values between infected WT and IL-33−/− lungs on D2.(B) Pathway enrichment analysis
  of top ten hallmark pathways in the lungs on D2.(C) Representative heatmaps of differently
  expressed genes of IFN-γ signaling pathway in the lungs of WT and IL-33−/− mice
  on D2. Heatmaps were generated based on KEGG pathway using the Rosalind platform.(D)
  Network plot showing the genes correlating IL-33 to the COVID-19 disease database
  identified by ingenuity pathway analysis of the bulk RNA-seq. The orange and green
  labels indicate upregulation and downregulation, respectively, when compare IL-33−/−
  to WT samples.(E) The network of differently expressed genes, pathways and cell
  functions analyzed by IPA network analyzer. The orange and blue legend on the right
  indicates the genes predicted to be activation or inhibition, respectively.
