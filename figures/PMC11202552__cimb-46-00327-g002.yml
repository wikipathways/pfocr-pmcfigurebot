figure_title: A simplified diagram of the insulin signaling pathway.
caption: 'A simplified diagram of the insulin signaling pathway. Insulin attaches
  to the insulin receptor which activates IRS-1. This activation leads to the recruitment
  of PI3K and subsequently activates Akt. ORANGE PATH: In skeletal muscle, Akt facilitates
  glucose uptake by moving GSVs to the plasma membrane. This process involves the
  activation of the GTP-bound form of RAC1. Additionally, insulin promotes glycogen
  synthesis by inhibiting GSK3, which activates GYS, and by inactivating glycogen
  phosphorylase through the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase. YELLOW PATH:
  In adipose tissue, insulin inhibits lipolysis by decreasing the availability of
  gluconeogenic substrates. This suppression is thought to be mediated by PDE3B, PP1,
  and PP2A. PURPLE PATH: In the liver, Akt reduces gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the
  expression of gluconeogenic genes mediated by FOXO1. Insulin enhances hepatic glycogen
  synthesis by regulating GYS2 and GSK3. Moreover, insulin promotes lipogenesis by
  up-regulating SREBP-1c. Abbreviations: IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; PI3K,
