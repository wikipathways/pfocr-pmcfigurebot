caption: Obesity corresponds with differential tumor transcriptomic signatures associated
  with metabolic reprogramming. (A) Volcano plot showing significantly down-regulated
  transcripts (blue, adj. p < 0.05 and |logFC| > 1.5) and up-regulated (pink, adj.
  p < 0.05 and |logFC| > 1.5) transcripts in ORIEN Adenocarcinoma patients that were
  obese (BMI ≥ 30), as compared to normal weight (BMI ≤ 25) patients. (B) Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) of these differentially expressed genes from obese vs.
  non-obese ORIEN analysis show pathways down-regulated (blue, left) and up-regulated
  (red, right) in obese patients, as compared to normal patients, which enrich for
  metabolic pathways, immune pathways and biological processes. (C) Further transcriptional
  pathway analysis specific to metabolic pathways in these same patients, enriched
  for several lipid and amino acid specific metabolic pathway dysregulation. Similar
  analysis comparing the transcriptome of obese patients to non-obese patients were
  conducted and displayed as volcano plots for the (D) TCGA colon adenocarcinoma (COAD)
  and (E) TCGA esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), where ESCA displayed far more significantly
  differentially expressed genes (red, adj. p < 0.05 and |logFC| > 1.5) than COAD.
  To demonstrate these transcriptional alterations, occur in a site-specific manner,
  (F) we looked for overlap between the significantly down-regulated (top) and up-regulated
  (bottom) genes between the COAD and ESCA datasets, and found minimal overlap. Gene
  set enrichment analysis of (G) COAD and (H) ESCA revealed transcriptional enrichment
  of cellular processes decreased in obese patients (blue) like G2M checkpoint, and
  methylation, and up-regulated processes (red) like immune complement activation
  and therapeutic resistance. Further, metabolic analysis revealed several similar
  metabolic pathways to be differentially regulated in both ESCA and COAD, albeit
  to a different extent. For example, (I) Modeling of the tryptophan/kynurenine/NAD
  pathway reveals a majority of transcripts are down-regulated (blue triangles, left),
  in ESCA obese as compared to normal patients. Conversely, a majority of transcripts
  are up-regulated (red triangles, right), in COAD obese as compared to normal patients
