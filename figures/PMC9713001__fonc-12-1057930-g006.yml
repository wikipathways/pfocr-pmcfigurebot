caption: Mechanistic role of miRNAs in PDAC cachexia. (A) Downregulated microRNAs
  (miRNAs) are indicated in green, and upregulated miRNAs are indicated in red. Based
  on the literature, miRNAs participate in the regulation of PDAC progression and
  metastasis, overcoming host immune responses, and the development of chemoresistance.
  (B). miRNAs associated with PDAC-CC are primarily involved in KRAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT,
  JAK-STAT, and TGF-β, NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathway … etc. miRNAs can be detected
  in tumor and serum and mediate crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment between tumor,
  muscle, and adipocytes, which are associated with the development of PDAC-CC. Some
  microRNAs are tissue specific. For example, miR-21 (TLR7-JUN), miR-155, let-7d and
  miR373 are specific contributed to muscle wasting in PDAC-CC (see  in detail). The
  most common genes, such as IL-6R, FOXO1, PDK4, and ZIP14, had been associated with
  muscle wasting in cachexia. In adipocytes, specific microRNAs may mediate the transcription
  factors C/EBPβ/δ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ, resulting in adipogenesis.
