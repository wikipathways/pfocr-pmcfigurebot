  Impacts of oligonol on biochemical and transcriptome changes in liver fibrosis model. (A) Schematic representation of in vivo study design. The red arrows represent the time points at which DMN was administered, and the ‘X’ markings denote the time points at which the rats were sacrificed. (B) Alterations in serum ALT and AST levels. Bar plots show the mean values with the corresponding standard error of the mean (SEM) for each group (n = 6). Statistical significance is indicated as follows: *** p < 0.001 vs. the control group and ##
  p < 0.01 and ###
  p < 0.001 vs. the DMN group. (C) Venn diagrams illustrating the overlapping liver fibrotic signatures (common DEGs of three liver fibrosis models) and DEGs affected by oligonol treatment. (D) Top ten significantly enriched pathways for 48 genes upregulated in the DMN model and downregulated upon oligonol treatment (left) and 10 genes downregulated in the DMN model and upregulated upon oligonol treatment (right). (E) Expression changes (log2 fold-change) of genes involved in the burn-wound-healing pathways under different conditions. Genes exhibiting significant changes in at least two liver fibrotic models were selected. Highlighted in red is Tp53, a gene of particular interest in this study. DMN, dimethylnitrosamine; AST, aspartate transaminase; ALT, alanine transaminase; NESs, normalized enrichment scores
