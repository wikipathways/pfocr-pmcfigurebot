  the mTORC1 signaling pathway.
caption: 'FARSB promotes the proliferation and migration of HCC cells by activating
  the mTORC1 signaling pathway. (A,D) Overexpression of FARSB and control group MHCC97H
  cells were treated with 20 nM rapamycin for 48 h. CCK-8 (A) and EdU (B) were used
  to detect the proliferation of MHCC97H cells. Fluorescent images showing EdU positive
  cells nuclei (green) and total nuclei in the samples (Hoechst, blue). Wound-healing
  assay (C) and Transwell assay (D) were used to detect the migration ability of MHCC97H
  cells. (E) Knockdown or overexpression of FARSB and control group MHCC97H cells
  were used for the xenograft tumor model in nude mice. Among them, FARSB overexpression
  and control group mice began on the eighth day; half of the nude mice were injected
  with normal saline and half were injected with rapamycin (4 mg/kg) for 16 days.
  The changes in tumor volume were recorded at different time points, and the subcutaneous
  tumors were removed and weighed. Representative immunohistochemical images showed
  the expression of FARSB and PCNA in xenograft tumor tissues. Scale: 50 Î¼m, ***:
