caption: Baseline characteristics of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines.
  Untreated lung cancer adenocarcinoma (AD) cell lines (H1373, H1781, and Calu3) and
  lung cancer squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines (H1703, H226, and Ludlu1) in
  exponential phase of growth were screened. (A) Protein expression of five isoforms
  of enzymes involved in cyclic nucleotide catabolism, PDE8a, PDE8b, PDE5a, PDE9a,
  and PDE10a, and two anabolic enzymes, adenylate cyclase (ADCY9) and guanylate cyclase
  (GUCY1B1), assessed by Western blotting. β-actin was used as the loading control.
  (B) Cyclic nucleotide catabolic and anabolic enzymes in NSCLC cell lines. Quantification
  of the ratio of cyclic nucleotide metabolic pathway proteins versus β-actin in NSCLC
  cell lines. Optical density of the signal is reported in intensity units (IUs).
  Center lines are in black. (C) Basal cAMP and cGMP and direct protein kinase (PKA
  and PKG) activity determined by cyclic nucleotide ELISA kit and with colorimetric
  activity kit, respectively. Cellular metabolite concentrations expressed as pmol
  cyclic nucleotides per µg of cellular protein. Enzymes activity presented as U per
  µg of cellular protein. Vertical bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).
  Different letters indicate values that are significantly different from each other
  (p < 0.05); N = 2, 4, 5. (D) Enzymes associated with cyclic nucleotide metabolism
  in NSCLC cell lines. Protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase G (PKG), and phosphorylated
  vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, VASP (Ser157 and Ser259), were measured in
  six NSCLC cell lines by Western blotting. β-actin was used as the loading control.
