figure_title: Effects of SG on TNF-α-induced MMP-9-mediated disruption of ZO-1 arranged
  integrity in bMECs.
caption: Effects of SG on TNF-α-induced MMP-9-mediated disruption of ZO-1 arranged
  integrity in bMECs. (A) Cells grown on coverslips were pretreated with U0126 (1
  μM), SB202190 (SB, 30 μM), SP600125 (SP, 10 μM), Bay11-7082 (Bay, 1 μM), and SG
  (1 μM) for 1 h and stimulated by TNF-α (30 ng/mL) for 24 h. After fixing and labeling
  with anti-ZO-1 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody, the immunofluorescence
  image represents the results from one of three individual experiments. (B) Schematic
  presentation of the brain-protective effects of SG on the disruption of ZO-1 integrity
  induced by TNF-α-stimulated MMP-9 in bMECs. TNF-α induces MMP-9 expression by MAPKs
  activation via TNFR-mediated NF-κB-dependent pathway. The upregulated MMP-9 leads
  to disruption of ZO-1 integrity in bMECs. SG blocks the disruption of ZO-1 integrity
  by TNF-α-induced MMP-9 via inhibiting TNFR-dependent activation of MAPKs (i.e.,
  ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2) and the NF-κB signaling pathway. The solid arrow indicates
  that its upstream and downstream relationships have been confirmed. The dotted arrow
  indicates that there are still unknown molecules involved
