figure_title: Mechanism of the antitumor effect of SST receptors after ligand binding.
caption: 'Mechanism of the antitumor effect of SST receptors after ligand binding.
  This mechanism involves several key signaling pathways: (1) Adenylate cyclase pathway:
  SSTR binds to adenylate cyclase and reduces levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) in the cell. Reducing the concentration of cAMP leads to the inhibition of
  protein kinase activity, which in turn prevents the activation of oncogenes and
  inhibits the development and progression of the tumor. (2) Tyrosine protein pathway:
  SSTR binds to SST, leading to an increase in protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP),
  which dephosphorylates and inactivates tyrosine kinase. Many protein kinases can
  be inhibited, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), leading to inhibition
  of DNA and protein synthesis. (3) Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway:
  SSTR increases the expression of p21 and p27 via PI3K, resulting in the inhibition
  of phosphorylation of PRb and the cyclin E-dependent kinase 2 complex. (4) Calcium
  signaling pathway: SSTR causes an ion exchange between Ca2+ and H+, which causes
  a decrease in the concentration of intracellular calcium, an increase in acidification
  of the intracellular environment and inhibition of cell proliferation'
