figure_title: lncRNA PEG13 activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via the miR-195/IRS1
  axis to promote the expression of MDM2 and inhibit that of age-related protein p53
  and its downstream effector p21, leading to a decrease in both cells aging and the
  senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
caption: lncRNA PEG13 activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via the miR-195/IRS1
  axis to promote the expression of MDM2 and inhibit that of age-related protein p53
  and its downstream effector p21, leading to a decrease in both cells aging and the
  senescence-associated secretory phenotype. lncRNA, long non-coding RNA; miR, microRNA;
  ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; MDM2,
  MDM2 proto-oncogene p53, tumor protein p53; p21, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
