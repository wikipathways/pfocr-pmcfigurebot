figure_title: GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes.
caption: 'GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes. The
  number on the top of the bar indicates the number of genes enriched in the GO term,
  the horizontal coordinate indicates the GO term, the rectangle on the GO term indicates
  CC, the circle indicates MF, and the absence of markers indicates BP. The vertical
  coordinate indicates the enrichment factor: the ratio of the number of genes enriched
  in the GO term to the number of annotated genes; the larger the enrichment factor,
  the greater the degree of enrichment (a). The number on the top of the bar indicates
  the number of genes enriched in the KEGG pathway, the abscissa represents the KEGG
  pathway, and the ordinate represents the enrichment factor (b). The color gradient
  indicates the significance of enrichment, where p-adjust < 0.01 is marked as **,
  p-adjust < 0.05 is marked as *, and 0.05 < p-adjust < 0.1 is marked as the p-adjust
  value'
