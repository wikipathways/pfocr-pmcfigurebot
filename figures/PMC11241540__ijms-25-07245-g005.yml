figure_title: Transcript levels of phenylpropanoid pathway genes in Arabidopsis plants
  over-expressing the PrMADS11 gene.
caption: 'Transcript levels of phenylpropanoid pathway genes in Arabidopsis plants
  over-expressing the PrMADS11 gene. The analyzed genes were (A) PrMADS11 in transgenic
  lines, (B) AtPAL (Phenylalanine amonium lyase), (C) AtCHS (Chalcone synthase), (D)
  AtF3H (Flavonoid 3-hydroxylase), (E) AtDFR (Dyhydroflavonol 4-reductase), (F) AtANS
  (Anthocyanidin synthase), (G) AtCOMT (Caffeic acid 3-O-methyl transferase), (H)
  AtCCoAOMT (Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyl transferase), (I) AtCCR (Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase),
  (J) At CAD (Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, (K) AtFLS1 (Flavonol synthase), and
  (L) AtFLS3 (Flavonol synthase). The quantitation of lignin was performed in each
  transgenic line (M). The relative expression was determined with RT-qPCR using the
  housekeeping AtFbox (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.0014, *** p < 0.0002, **** p < 0.0001)
  with Tukey’s test. ns: no significance'
