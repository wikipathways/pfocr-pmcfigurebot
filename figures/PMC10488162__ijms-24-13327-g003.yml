figure_title: The role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in age-related ovarian aging.
caption: 'The role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in age-related ovarian aging. When
  exposed to oxidative stress, the Nrf2 pathway is active to protect against oxidative
  stress damage. Nrf2 declines with age in both oocytes and granulosa cells, and cellular
  antioxidant capacity is reduced, which influences cellular oxidative stress, apoptosis,
  and ferroptosis, eventually affecting cellular function. Some of the material in
  the image was sourced from BioRender.com, accessed on 24 July 2023. The red line
  represents inhibition and the black line represents promotion. peroxiredoxin 1:
  PRDX1; superoxide dismutase1: SOD1; catalase: CAT; heme oxygenase 1: HO-1; thioredoxin
  1: TXN1; NADP (H) quinone dehydrogenase 1: NQO1; glutathione peroxidase 4: GPX4'
