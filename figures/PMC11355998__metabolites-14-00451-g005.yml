figure_title: DEGs and their function in each species.
caption: DEGs and their function in each species. The overlapping number of DEGs for
  the comparison between each species and each of the other species is shown in each
  Venn diagram. Venn diagrams illustrating DEGs detected in the liver (A) and small
  intestine (B) for each species. (C) GO enrichment analysis (molecular function,
  MF) (the first five panels) and KEGG pathway enrichment (the last three panels)
  for DEGs in the liver for each species using the overlapping DEGs
