caption: A) Histogram showing the percentage and number of altered signaling pathways
  in lesional compared with nonlesional samples (left). Pie chart showing the seven
  distribution possibilities and percentage of 232 genes in six donors, with numbers
  0 to 6 and corresponding percentiles indicating certain percentage of genes that
  are significantly changed in 0 to 6 donors. Violin plots illustrate the expression
  changes of representative genes (EGF, ACVR1B, ADM, BMP2, ITGAV, VEGFB), which are
  significantly altered in 0 to 5 donors in lesional compared to nonlesional samples.
  Wilcoxon test was used to perform the statistical analysis (right), ns (not significant),
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.001. B) Dot plot shows 26 genes significantly
  altered across six donors; 10 genes highlighted in red indicate consistent expression
  trends across all matched pairs in all patients. Among these, 5 are bolded to indicate
  their specific expression in keratinocytes, lymphocytes, and myeloid cells. The
  color scale indicates the average scaled expression of each gene, and the dot size
  reflects the percentage of cells expressing each gene. C) Violin plots reveal five
  genes (IL-4R, IL-13RA1, FAS, GRN, SDC1) consistently and significantly changed among
  the six donors, analyzed using the Wilcoxon test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
  0.001, ****P < 0.001. D-E) Violin plot showing the GRN (D) and IL-13RA1(E) expression
  in subsets of myeloid cells. Wilcoxon test was used to perform the statistical method,
  ns (not significant), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. F-G) Violin plot showing
  the IL-13RA1(F) and SDC1 (G) expression in subsets of keratinocytes. Wilcoxon test
  was used to perform the statistical method, ns (not significant), **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001. H) Violin plots showing the IL-4R and FAS expression in subsets of lymphocytes.
  Wilcoxon test was used to perform the statistical method, ns (not significant)
