caption: Secondary metabolite–directed cell injury model. Depiction of the six ICI
  mechanisms measured (color-coded pathways, e.g., unfolded protein response) highlights
  the key readout for each signal (pink highlighted boxes, e.g., p-EIF2α) and indicates
  a control compound characterized as a positive effector of the pathway (blue text,
  e.g., thapsigargin). Thapsigargin inhibition of Ca-ATPase SERCA in the endoplasmic
  reticulum increases free calcium in the cytosol to trigger ER stress response pathways
  including the ER-resident transmembrane protein kinase, PERK, which phosphorylates
  eIF2α to inhibit translation until ER stress resolution. Bafilomycin A1 blocks autophagy
  by inhibiting V-ATPase on the lysosome and phagolysosome membranes thus hindering
  lumen acidification and subsequent activation of serine hydrolases therein. In turn,
  this prevents LC3 protein degradation on autophagic structures yielding increased
  levels of LC3. Staurosporine is canonically considered a pan-kinase inhibitor that
  occludes ATP-binding pockets. Staurosporine inhibition of PKC and mitochondria-localized
  enzymes result in disinhibition of APAF1, an apoptosome-related protein that facilitates
  conversion of CAS9 to its active form cCAS9 which then cleaves CAS3 to activate
  apoptotic hallmark cCAS3. Nocodazole binds beta-tubulin to prevent microtubule elongation.
  This prevents cellular division leading to enhanced levels of phosphorylated histone
  H3 protein. Additionally, microtubule inhibition can increase resident levels of
  the necroptotic execution protein p-MLKL. MLKL is phosphorylated following signal
  transduction via phosphorylation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 after exiting nuclear-cytosol
  cycling in response to stress. p-MLKL is trafficked to the cell membrane for oligomerization
  and insertion into the cell membrane leading to cell lysis. Etoposide forms a ternary
  complex with DNA and topoisomerase II to prevent religation of DNA yielding double
  strand breaks sensed by ATM. ATM then phosphorylates histone variant H2AX (γH2AX),
  which activates the DNA damage response to resolve double strand breaks. Literature
  evidence indicates inhibition and/or activation of these pathways can be proimmunogenic;
  however, the relative temporal relationship of these signals to enhance immunogenic
  cell death remains under investigated. To measure downstream cellular functions
  following ICI signaling mechanisms, three mechanisms of immunogenic cell death can
  be measured, namely calreticulin, HMGB1, and ATP. Each DAMP is shown interacting
  with respective surface receptors on an antigen presenting cell in purple. DAMP,
  damage associated molecular pattern; ICI, immunogenic cell injury.
