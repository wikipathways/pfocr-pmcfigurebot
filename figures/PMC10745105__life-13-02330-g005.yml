figure_title: GAH repairs vascular impairment by upregulating the mRNA and protein
  levels of BMP and VEGF signaling pathway members.
caption: 'GAH repairs vascular impairment by upregulating the mRNA and protein levels
  of BMP and VEGF signaling pathway members. (a) Spatiotemporal expression of kdrl
  by ISH in different groups. Red arrows indicated the specific expression of kdrl
  in PMBC, PCV, CV, DA, and MCeV. Scale bars: 100 μm. The proportion of embryonic
  expression patterns in each group was shown as indicated and based on four (for
  DMH1) and three (for DM) repetitions. (b,d) Relative mRNA expression levels of bmp2b,
  bmp4, vegfaa, kdrl, and fli1 by quantitative PCR in different treatment groups as
  indicated. gapdh: reference gene. Each gene was tested at least five times. (c,e)
  Protein levels of Bmp2b, Bmp4, Vegfa, and Vegfr2 in different groups by ELISA assay.
  Each protein was repeated 2–3 times. p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***),
  and NS, nonsignificant'
