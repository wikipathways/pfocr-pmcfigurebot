figure_title: Identification of the expression of key genes of the TLR signaling pathway.
caption: 'Identification of the expression of key genes of the TLR signaling pathway.
  Note: (A,B) Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (24 and 48 h), we have circled
  seven immune-related genes in red; (C,D) qPCR verification of DEGs at 24 and 48
  h. Blue represents NC and purple represents chERV3 (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ***
  p < 0.001)'
