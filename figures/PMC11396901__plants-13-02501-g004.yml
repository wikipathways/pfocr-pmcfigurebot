caption: Stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthetic pathway. (A) Genes
  of the pathway (downstream flow visualized by black arrows) are along the two STRS
  trajectories (gray arrows), indicating their condition-specific activation. (B)
  The heatmap shows the expression changes in response to WS. (C) KEGG pathway with
  gene color code derived from their positions in the SOM portrait indicated by the
  colored waterline portraits of SG CTRL and STRS and MP CTRL and STRS (see the lower
  right part)
