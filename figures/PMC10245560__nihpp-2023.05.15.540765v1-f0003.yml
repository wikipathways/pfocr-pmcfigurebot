figure_title: Clovibactin targets cell wall biosynthesis
caption: |-
  (A) Effect of clovibactin on macromolecular biosyntheses in S. aureus. Incorporation of 3H-thymidine (DNA), 3H-uridine (RNA), 3H-leucine (protein), and 3H-glucosamine (peptidoglycan) was determined in cells treated with clovibactin at 2xMIC (grey bars). Ciprofloxacin (8xMIC), rifampicin (4xMIC), vancomycin (2xMIC) and erythromycin (2xMIC) were used as positive controls (white bars). Data are averages of two independent experiments. (B)
  B. subtilis bioreporter strains with selected promotor-lacZ fusions were used to identify interference with major biosynthesis pathways. β-galactosidase (lacZ) is fused to promotors PypuA (cell wall), PyorB (DNA), PyvgS (RNA), and Pyhel (protein) and induction of a specific stress response is visualized by a blue halo at the edge of the inhibition zone. Antibiotics vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, and clindamycin were used as positive controls. (C) Clovibactin treatment results in cell-shape deformations and characteristic blebbing as observed by phase-contrast microscopy of B. subtilis. Cell wall active antibiotics teixobactin, hypeptin, vancomycin and protein synthesis inhibitor clindamycin were used as controls. Scale bar = 2 μm. (D) Clovibactin (1xMIC, blue) strongly induced Plial as observed by expression of the lux operon in B. subtilis PliaI-lux. Teixobactin, hypeptin, vancomycin and clindamycin were used as control antibiotics. (E) Intracellular accumulation of the soluble cell wall precursor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide after treatment of S. aureus with different concentrations of clovibactin. Untreated and VAN-treated (5xMIC) cells were used as controls. Experiments are representatives of 3 independent experiments. (F) Clovibactin inhibits membrane-associated steps of PGN and WTA synthesis in vitro. The antibiotic was added in molar ratios from 0.5 to 4 with respect to the amount of the lipid substrate C55P, C55PP, lipid II, or lipid IIIWTA used in the individual test systems. Reaction product synthesized in the absence of antibiotic was taken as 100%. Mean values from three independent experiments are shown. Error bars represent standard deviation. (G) Antagonization of the antimicrobial activity of clovibactin by cell wall precursors. S. aureus was incubated with clovibactin (8×MIC) in nutrient broth in microtiter plates, and growth was measured after a 24 h incubation at 37 °C. Putative HPLC-purified antagonists (undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate [C55PP], lipid I, lipid II, and lipid IIIWTA) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-glycerol (DOPG) were added in at molar ratios with respect to the antibiotic. Experiments were performed with biological replicates. +antagonization; - no antagonization
