caption: Hy-Exos inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, maintain mitochondrial
  dynamic stabilization and alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction in UC mice. A-D. RT-PCR
  was performed to measure IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 expression in the colon tissues
  of mice. E-H. Western blotting was used to measure p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR
  expression in colon tissues. I-J. PKH26-stained Exos and Hy-Exos colocalized with
  Claudin1 and Occludin. Scale bar = 150 μm. K-L. Claudin1 and Occludin expression
  in colon tissues was determined by western blotting. M-R. Western blotting was used
  to measure the expression of Drp1, Fis1, Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 in colon tissues.
  S-U. Determination of the CAT, GSH, and MDA contents in colon tissues. Data are
  shown as the mean ± SD. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001)
