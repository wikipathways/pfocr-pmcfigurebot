figure_title: IAV infection inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, resulting in
  down-regulation of DNMT1.
caption: IAV infection inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, resulting in down-regulation
  of DNMT1. (A) A549 cells were treated with LY294002 (40 μM) or infected with CA07
  (MOI = 5) for 48 h. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis to measure
  DNMT1, influenza A virus HA protein, p-AKT and total AKT levels. β-actin was utilized
  as an internal reference. (B–D) The gray values of DNMT1 (B), AKT (C) and p-AKT
  (D) in three independent biological repeated experiments were calculated by ImageJ
  software. (E) The ratio of p-AKT to total AKT was calculated. (F,G) QRT-PCR detection
  of DNMT1 mRNA in A549 cells treated with LY294002 (40 μM) (F) or 740 Y-P (30 μM)
  (G). (H) A549 cells were treated with DMSO (negative control) or LY294002 (40 μM)
  for 48 h. DNMT1 expression was visualized by immunofluorescent staining. DNMT1 was
  stained green; nuclei were stained blue (DAPI). Data are expressed as the mean +
  SD of three independent experiments. ns, no significance; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001 (Student’s t-test)
