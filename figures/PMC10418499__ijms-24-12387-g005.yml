figure_title: Main metabolic pathways of Chao2R and RPY geng seedlings in response
  to saline–alkaline stress.
caption: Main metabolic pathways of Chao2R and RPY geng seedlings in response to saline–alkaline
  stress. Metabolites and genes were mapped to an integrated systemic metabolic pathway
  diagram based on combining the KEGG pathways of DAMs and DEGs. The first and second
  boxes indicate the log2 (fold change) of metabolites in Chao2R and RPY geng, respectively,
  after subjected to saline–alkaline treatment in contrast to untreated control, in
  which red indicates upregulation, and blue indicates downregulation. The metabolic
  pathways involvement in alkaloid, phenolic acid, lipid, amino acid, organic acid,
  saccharide, and plant signal transduction are marked in purple, green, blue, orange,
  black, light green, and red, respectively
