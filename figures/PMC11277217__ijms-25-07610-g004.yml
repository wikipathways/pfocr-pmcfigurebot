caption: 'Transcriptome analysis of the effects of palovarotene on cultured chondrocytes.
  (A) Experiment protocol. Epiphyseal chondrocytes were isolated from AcanCreER;Ext1f/f
  and Ext1f/f mice at P10 after tamoxifen injections at P5 and P7. The isolated chondrocytes
  were seeded in alginate beads (40 μL) at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/mL. After
  2 days, the cultures were treated with 300 nM palovarotene or the same volume of
  vehicle solution (ethanol) for 2 days. The cells were then dissociated and subjected
  to bulk RNA-seq analysis. (B) IPA of the DEGs was performed in control and palovarotene-treated
  chondrocyte cultures isolated from AcanCreER;Ext1f/f mice (left), and AcanCreER;Ext1f/f
  and Ext1f/f chondrocytes cultured without palovarotene treatment (right). The top
  eight pathways are shown. The osteoarthritis pathway was significantly activated
  in AcanCreER;Ext1f/f chondrocytes by palovarotene, while this pathway was significantly
  downregulated by Ext1 deletion. (C) Heat maps of the comparison analysis of two
  conditions: AcanCreER;Ext1f/f vs. Ext1f/f chondrocytes (AcanER;Ext1f/f to Ext1f/f),
  and palovarotene-treated vs. untreated AcanCreER;Ext1f/f chondrocytes (Palovarotene
  treatment in AcanER;Ext1f/f). The top 10 and 5 ranked canonical pathways and upstream
  regulators, respectively, are shown. The opposite alterations caused by Ext1 deficiency
  and palovarotene treatment were visualized. (D) Heat map of the comparative analysis
  of two conditions: palovarotene-treated vs. untreated AcanCreER;Ext1f/f mouse chondrocytes
  (Mouse AcanER;Ext1f/f), and palovarotene-treated vs. untreated human osteochondroma
  explants (Human Osteochondroma). Previously reported results of palovarotene treatment
  in human osteochondroma explants [14] were used. Similar differences, including
  activation of the interferon signaling pathway, were observed with these two conditions'
