caption: 'Interactions and influence of RUNX1 and MUC13 on colorectal cancer mechanisms.
  (A) The expression levels of E-cadherin and vimentin in murine liver metastatic
  tumor tissues were assessed through IHC staining. Scale bar: 100 μm. (B, C) Western
  blot analysis of EMT markers in F0 (B) and F3 (C) cells, illustrating effects of
  RUNX1 and MUC13 modifications. Accompanied by quantification of protein levels in
  bar graphs on the right. (D, E) Western blot analysis of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway components (β-catenin, p-GSK-3β, GSK-3β) in F0 (D) and F3 (E) cells, with
  quantification in bar graphs on the right. (F, G) qPCR results of EMT-related transcription
  factors (Snail, Slug, Twist1, ZEB1, ZEB2) in F0 (F) and F3 (G) following RUNX1 and
  MUC13 modulation. (H, I) qPCR quantification of β-catenin, AXIN2, c-MYC, and Cyclin
  D1 transcripts in F0 (H) and F3 (I) cells, following genetic modulation of RUNX1
  and MUC13. (J, K) Scatter plots derived from the GEPIA database illustrating correlations
  between RUNX1 or MUC13 expression and specified genes of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway, based on Spearman correlation analysis. R, Spearman coefficient. Error
  bars represent mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001'
