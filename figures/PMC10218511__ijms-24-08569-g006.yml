figure_title: Heat stress induces intestinal injury by activating the PPAR-α signaling
  pathway.
caption: Heat stress induces intestinal injury by activating the PPAR-α signaling
  pathway. (A) Volcano plot of DEGs in intestinal mucosa under heat stress; The black
  dots indicate no significant difference. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of
  DEGs in intestinal mucosa under heat stress. (C) Enrichment analysis of PPAR-α signaling
  pathway. (D–G) The DEGs in intestinal mucosa were verified by qRT-PCR. The reference
  gene is β-actin. Data are expressed as means ± SD. **, p < 0.01 using a one-way
  analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s HSD test. CO, control groups; HS,
  heat stress groups
