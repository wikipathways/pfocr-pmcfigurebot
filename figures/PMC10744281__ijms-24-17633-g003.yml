  glioma.
caption: 'Regulation of apoptotic process by glycolysis and lipid metabolism in glioma.
  The apoptosis is activated via death receptors (extrinsic) and mitochondrial (intrinsic).
  The extrinsic pathway is activated by death receptors from the tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF) family such as Fas (Apo/CD95) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
  receptors between others, both located on the cell surface, once the Fas/Fas R complex,
  they recruit at Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein, which is responsible
  for recruiting and autoactivation of initiator procaspase-8, which in turn promotes
  cleaves and the catalytic activation of the effector caspase-3. Furthermore, caspase-8
  hydrolyzes at Bid pro-apoptotic protein and generates tBid, which induces the Bax
  mitochondrial translocation inducing the release of cyt c from mitochondria to cytosol
  and the subsequent activation of pro-caspase9. On the other hand, an apoptotic pathway
  also is regulated by Hexokinase2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase (PKM2), glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate
  Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Hexadecenal (HexaD), ceramide (Ce), and sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (SIP). HK2, also bound voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the mitochondrial
  inhibiting apoptosis. The PKM2 inhibits apoptosis through binding and phosphorylation
  of Bcl-2, whereas Hsp90α1 mediates the binding between Bcl-2 and PKM2. Nuclear GA3PDH
  induces the activation of p53 and inhibition of Hsp70 at the cytoplasmic level.
  HexaD, Ce, CL, and SIP are inhibitors of Bax pro-apoptotic proteins. Furthermore,
  Cl inhibits at Bidt and fatty acid synthase (FASN), is an activator of bcl2 antiapoptotic
  proteína and an inhibitor of pro-apoptotic proteins including Puma, Noxa, and Bax,
  which are positively regulated by p53. Abbreviation: B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2),
  B cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL), Fas-associated via death domain (FADD), caspases
  (Casp)-8,-10,-9 and -3 ↑ activation, ⊥ inhibition. The figure was created with BioRender.com'
