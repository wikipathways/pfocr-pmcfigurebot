caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of Rosmarinic Acid. Enzymes are shown with
  in orange and blue letters. Enzyme substrates are shown in black letters. The chemical
  structure derived from L-Phenylalanine is shown in blue and the chemical structure
  derived from L-Tyrosine is shown in brown-red. Green color shows the hydroxyl groups
  that come from the action of enzyme CYP450
