caption: Diverse cell types including mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal
  stromal/stem cells (MSCs), and cancer cells all have spheroid-forming capacity in
  3D in vitro culture. (A) Schematic diagram of 3D spheroid culture method. A total
  of 106 cells of ESCs, MSCs, or Lewis lung cancer cells (cancer) were cultured in
  3D conditions for 3 days to induce spheroid formation. Two-dimensional culture was
  performed according to standard practice (please see Section 2). (B) Morphology
  of ESCs, MSCs, and cancer cultured for 3 days in 3D spheroid vs. 2D conditions as
  visualized by phase-contrast microscopy. Scale bar, 500 µm. (C) Live/dead staining
  with Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (Calcein-AM, Green, living cells) and ethdium homodimer-1
  (EthD-1, Red, dead cells) of ESCs, MSCs, and cancer cells cultured for 3 days in
  the 3D spheroid vs. 2D condition. Diverse cell types of the 3D condition would be
  treated with methanol for 30 min as dead positive control. Scale bar, 50 µm. (D)
  Principal component analysis (PCA) of transcriptome profiles of ESCs, MSCs, or cancer
  cells cultured in 2D or 3D conditions. (E) Bioinformatics analyses of transcriptomic
  profiles of 3D vs. 2D on the three cell types using GSEA. Significant enrichment
  and downregulation of cell cycle E2F (G1 phase) and G2/M gene sets in ESCs, MSCs,
  and cancer cells cultured in 3D vs. 2D conditions. (F) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA)—based pathway analysis for cell cycle related genes in transcriptomic profiles
  of MSCs cultured in 3D vs. 2D conditions. Upregulated genes are indicated in red
  and downregulated genes in green. Solid and dashed lines indicate direct and indirect
  interactions, respectively. Results for 3D- vs. 2D-culture ESCs and cancer cells
  are shown in Figure S1. (G) Cell numbers of ESCs, MSCs, and cancer cells cultured
  in 3D vs. 2D conditions. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *, p < 0.05 and **, p
  < 0.01, compared with 2D condition. (H) Cell cycle dynamics of ESCs, MSCs, and cancer
  cells cultured in 3D vs. 2D conditions as analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM. a, p < 0.01, for comparison of G1 phase in 3D- vs. 2D-cultured ESCs;
  b, p < 0.05, for comparison of G1 phase in 3D- vs. 2D-cultured MSCs; and c, p <
  0.05, for comparison of G1 phase in 3D- vs. 2D-cultured cancer cells
