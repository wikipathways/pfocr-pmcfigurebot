figure_title: Microbial-associated immune dysregulation.
caption: Microbial-associated immune dysregulation. (A) Scatter plots showing microbial-associated
  enrichment of select immune pathways. Nominal enrichment scores (NESs) and p-values
  are plotted. Each point represents a microbe–pathway combination. Only differentially
  abundant microbes were chosen for analysis. (B) Strip chart of microbe–cytokine
  correlations. p-values are plotted. Each point represents a microbe–cytokine combination,
  with sizes and colors indicating their correlation coefficients (R-value). Only
  differentially abundant microbes were chosen for analysis. Cytokines show positive
  correlation to a vast majority of the differentially abundant species
