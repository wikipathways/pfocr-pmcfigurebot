figure_title: The immune response process of plant root systems against pathogenic
  agents.
caption: 'The immune response process of plant root systems against pathogenic agents.
  (A) Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) process: Plant cells recognize pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which initiate
  a series of downstream signaling pathways. This includes the activation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs), which in turn activate mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The
  activation of these kinases leads to the conversion of ADP to ATP, providing energy
  for signal transduction. The signaling pathways activate calcium-dependent protein
  kinases (CDPKs) and other protein kinases, which further phosphorylate substrate
  proteins, facilitating intracellular signal transduction. These signals ultimately
  lead to the activation of transcription factors (TFs) in the nucleus, thereby inducing
  the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRPs) and enhancing the plantâ€™s
  defense response. Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) process: To combat PTI, pathogens
  secrete effector proteins. The recognition of these effectors by NLR proteins leads
  to their activation, which may involve oligomerization or conformational changes.
  The activation of NLR proteins initiates a potent immune response, characterized
  by intracellular signal transduction and changes in gene expression. This results
  in the binding of the activated NLR proteins to the effectors, inducing programmed
  cell death, such as the hypersensitive response (HR). (B) In the process of intracellular
  signal transduction in plant cells, the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of
  proteins occur. This process is crucial for the regulation of various cellular functions
  and responses to environmental stimuli. Abbreviations: ROS, reactive oxygen species;
