caption: 'Effect of TAC/MSC on phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/P-protein kinase B
  (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) signaling pathway in PA-treated HepG2
  cells. Cells in all groups except the control group were treated with PA (0.1 mM).
  TAC (6 μg/mL), MSC (5 μg/mL (27.4 μM)), or metformin (10 μg/mL) were used in Western
  blot. Cells in the model group were treated with PA only. After 24 h of drug treatment,
  each well was stimulated with insulin (100 nM). (A) The protein expression and phosphorylation
  of PI3K/Akt/GSK3β in HepG2 cells. Densitometric analysis of (B) P-PI3K/PI3K, (C)
  P-GSK3β/GSK3β, and (D) P-AKT/AKT. The results are expressed as the mean ± SD (n
  = 3). *** p < 0.001 vs. control. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001 vs. model.
  & p < 0.05, compared to TAC'
