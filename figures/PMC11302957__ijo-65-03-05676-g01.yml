caption: YAP1 and the hallmarks of cancer. When YAP1 is active and not phosphorylated
  by the Hippo pathway, it translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. In the
  nucleus, YAP1 can act as an oncogene by inducing the transcription of genes that
  contribute to cancer development. YAP1 activation promotes cell proliferation, invasion
  and metastasis, tumor drug resistance, metabolic reprogramming, immune cells, autophagy,
  genetic mutations and chromosomal instability. YAP1, yes-associated transcriptional
  regulator
