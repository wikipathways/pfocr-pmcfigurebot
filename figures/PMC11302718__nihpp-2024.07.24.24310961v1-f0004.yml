figure_title: Asymmetric dimethylarginine is uniquely elevated in HFpEF while homocitrulline
  is elevated in both forms of HF
caption: A) Metabolic pathway depicting the formation of asymmetric dimethylarginine
  (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and subsequently their effects on arginine
  metabolism. B) Bar graphs depicting mean +/− SD of serum concentrations of Arginine
  (left), SDMA (middle), and ADMA (right) by cohort. Asterisk indicates p-value <
  .05. C) Metabolic pathway depicting the formation of homocitrulline residues from
  the incorporation of isocyanate into proteins with lysine residues. D) Bar graph
  depicting mean +/− SD of serum concentrations of Homocitrulline by cohort, showing
  significant elevation in HFrEF. Asterisk indicates p-value < .05
