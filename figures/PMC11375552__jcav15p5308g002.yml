caption: AS101 reduces the protein levels of heparanase and the AKT/mTOR pathway.
  4T1 (A) and CT26 (B) cells were incubated with AS101 for 24 hours at different concentrations
  (0-8 μM). The protein levels of heparanase, AKT and mTOR were measured by Western
  blotting. Quantification histograms of 4T1 (C) and (D) CT26 are presented beneath
  each Western blotting plot. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three repeated
  determinations
