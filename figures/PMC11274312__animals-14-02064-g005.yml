figure_title: GSEA plot of GO terms and KEGG pathways.
caption: GSEA plot of GO terms and KEGG pathways. (A) Immune response; (B) Defense
  against bacteria; (C) Innate immune response; (D) Regulation of immune response;
  (E) Hematopoietic cell lineage; (F) PI3K-Akt signaling pathway; (G) Human T cell
  leukemia virus 1 infection; (H) Epsteinâ€“Barr virus infection. The green line represents
  the running enrichment score, which is calculated for each gene in the gene list
  and connected from left to right. The black vertical line indicates the position
  of each member of the gene list on the ordered dataset. Color bar from red to blue
  represents the relative expression (HN-B vs. NC) of genes in the gene list from
  increasing to decreasing. The bottom gray area plot shows the expression distribution
  of genes in the gene list
