figure_title: Protein expression and phosphorylation degree of key factors in MAPK–ERK
  and PI3K–AKT signaling pathway.
caption: Protein expression and phosphorylation degree of key factors in MAPK–ERK
  and PI3K–AKT signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of JUK1/2/3, ERK1/2, and
  their phosphorylation levels in different cell groups. (B) Histogram of quantized
  analysis of each strip in the MAPK–ERK signal path. (C) Western blot analysis of
  AKT, PI3K, and their phosphorylation levels in different cell groups. (D) Histogram
  of quantized analysis of each strip in the PI3K–AKT signal path. * was considered
  to indicate a significant difference (p < 0.05); **** was considered to indicate
  a highly significant difference (p < 0.01); and ns was considered to indicate no
  significant difference (p ≥ 0.05)
