caption: ML385 inhibits the antioxidative and vascular function-enhancing effects
  of Shh overexpression in HUVECs after IR. (A) The expression of GDF15 in HUVECs
  was analyzed by qRT-PCR. (B) p-H2AX expression was increased after IR, and overexpression
  of the Shh gene reduced p-H2AX production and activated Nrf2. (C–E) Treatment of
  HUVECs overexpressing Shh with ML385 before IR resulted in blockade of the Nrf2
  pathway, while the expression level of Shh remained unaltered. (F,G) Western blot
  and quantitative analysis revealed that p-H2AX expression and DNA damage were increased
  following the inhibition of the Nrf2 pathway. (H–J) After activation of the Hh pathway,
  the promotion of VEGF and CD31 expression was inhibited by ML385. (K) ML385 pretreatment
  promoted endothelial cell apoptosis after IR. The data are shown as the mean ± standard
  error of the mean (SEM); ns (not significant), * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01), ***
  (p < 0.001), and **** (p < 0.0001) indicate significant differences
