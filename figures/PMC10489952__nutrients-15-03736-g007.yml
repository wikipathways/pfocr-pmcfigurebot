figure_title: The protein expression levels of lipid metabolism-related genes in the
  abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of mice.
caption: The protein expression levels of lipid metabolism-related genes in the abdominal
  subcutaneous adipose tissue of mice. (A) Increased protein expression levels of
  adipocyte differentiation factor (PPAR-γ and C/EBP-α) genes due to acetate treatment;
  (B) Increased protein expression level of the lipid synthesis (LPL) gene and decreased
  protein expression level of the lipolytic factor (HSL) gene due to acetate treatment;
  (C) Increased the protein expression levels of fatty acid synthesis factor (FAS
  and ACC-1) genes and decreased protein expression level of fatty acid decomposition
  factor (CPT-1) genes due to acetate treatment; (D) Increased protein expression
  levels of short-chain fatty acid receptor (GPR41 and GPR43) genes and decreased
  protein expression level of fatty acid metabolism signaling factors (AMPK-α) due
  to acetate treatment; (E) Increased phosphorylation levels of signaling pathway
  proteins (p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK and mTOR) and decreased phosphorylation levels of
  signaling pathway proteins (AMPK-α) due to acetate treatment, with the phosphorylation
  levels being represented by phospho-protein/total protein. A representative Western
  blot is shown in the figure. Data are mean ± SD, and statistical significance was
  determined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test; n = 15/group. Different lowercase letters in the same gene/protein indicate
  significant differences between groups (p < 0.05). LFD-0 represents control mice
  treated with 0.9% NaCl solution via gavage. HFD-0 represents obese mice treated
  with 0.9% NaCl solution via gavage. HFD-3 represents obese mice treated with 3.0
  g/kg of acetate via gavage
