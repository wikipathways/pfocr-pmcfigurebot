caption: An analysis of DEGs involved in the brassinosteroids biosynthetic pathway
  in Pyrus betulifolia under high-temperature stress. The six boxes from leaf to right
  represent H_9 h_1, H_9 h_2, H_9 h_3, H_0 h_1, H_0 h_2, and H_0 h_3, respectively.
  The expression levels for DEGs are normalized to log10 counts based on the fragments
  per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values and are presented
  in color; the blue-to-orange gradient denotes a gradual increase in gene expression
