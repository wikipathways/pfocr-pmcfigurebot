caption: Oxidative phosphorylation (a), estrogen (b), and oxytocin (c) signaling pathways
  are altered with COVID-19. A KEGG analysis explains the pathways relevant to the
  clinical symptoms of COVID-19 during pregnancy. Alterations in oxidative phosphorylation
  (please note all the DEGs are downregulated). Genes marked in red and green are,
  respectively, up- and downregulated > 2 folds
