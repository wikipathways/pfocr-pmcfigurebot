figure_title: CD137-induced Tex cell expansion does not require TCR/calcineurin signaling
  pathway
caption: (A and B) WT CD8+ T cells were transferred into B2m−/− mice subsequently
  treated with anti-CD137 (10 μg; 3H3, i.p. twice a week) or Ig mAbs. (A) Experimental
  design. (B) Frequency of splenic PD1+Tim3+ CD8+ Tem cells.(C) WT mice were treated
  with cyclosporin A or FK506 in combination with anti-CD137 or Ig. Frequency of Tim3+PD1+
  or Tox+ CD8+Tem cells.(D) Nur77GFP mice were treated with anti-CD137 or IgG for
  the indicated period. Expression of GFP by CD8+ Tem cells after 1, 7, and 14 days
  of treatment or upon 24 h of anti-CD3+CD28 in vitro.(E) Shannon entropy-based expansion
  score of clusters from Figure 3H. Color of the dots indicates the intensity of the
  score and size the number of cells.(F) Frequency of CD8+ T cells according to their
  expansion between subsets and treatments. Each dot represents a resampling of the
  original dataset equivalent to 90% of the smallest treatment-subset sample.(G and
  H) Clonal overlap between the main Tpex and Tex clusters. Circos plots (G) and Morisita
  index (H). Data are presented as mean ± SEM from at least 2 independent experiments.
  Each symbol represents an individual mouse. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
