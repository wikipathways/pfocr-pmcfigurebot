figure_title: IMPDH2 expression during regeneration
caption: (A) Schematic of the de novo purine synthesis pathway upstream of IMPDH.
  Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) enters and is converted into inosine monophosphate
  (IMP) before commitment by IMPDH into xanthine monophosphate (XMP) and ultimately
  GTP. Enzymes are boxed with fill color representing an overall increase (green)
  or decrease (red) in transcript levels at 24 hpa.(B) Expression of de novo purine
  synthesis genes at 0 and 24 hpa as log2FC to 0 hpa mean. Statistical significance
  was determined using EdgeR. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ns, not significant.(C) In
  situ hybridization of impdh2 at 0, 24, and 72 hpa in injured and uninjured tadpoles.
  Expression appears concentrated in muscle tissue, with somitic boundaries clearly
  visible. Overall expression declines during development, but increases specifically
  in the regenerating tissue at 72 hpa. Numbers in the top right of each panel indicate
  the number of samples that resemble the representative image over the total number
  assayed. Arrows indicate the plane of amputation.(D) Western blot for IMPDH2 and
  β-actin in injured (+) or uninjured (−) tails at 0, 24, and 72 hpa
