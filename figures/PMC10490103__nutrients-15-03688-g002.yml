caption: Lifestyle interventions such as food and nutrient intake and physical activity
  in early pre-symptomatic AD can regulate the expression of both circulating microRNAs
  (c-miRNAs) and brain-derived miRNAs. In the case of c-miRNAs, they could be used
  as early biomarkers of disease risk or could create an inter-tissular crosstalk
  by regulating the expression of distant genes in different tissues, such as the
  brain. Regarding brain miRNAs, some of them are involved in modulating dysregulated
  pathways in AD pathophysiology, increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
  levels and hippocampal volume, and reducing Aβ aggregation, neuroinflammation, and
  brain atrophy, which ultimately could delay the development of the disease
