caption: Schematically representing the signal transduction and biological activities
  induced by androgen in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Endogenous androgen, DHT,
  activates ER-mediated PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways to regulate cell proliferation.
  Moreover, the process of ERK1/2-mediated cell proliferation is controlled by the
  activation of EGFRs stimulated by EGF, as well as the activation of iAR induced
  by the synthetic androgen, R1881. Upon EGFRs activation, it not only involves the
  formation of an association between iAR and Src complex but also triggers cell proliferation
  through PI3K/Akt/ERK1/2 signaling. Stimulation of mAR by TAC triggers the phosphorylation
  of FAK and Akt, resulting in enhanced cell apoptosis. In this mAR-mediated apoptosis,
  SGK1 plays a role in improving the apoptotic effect. Cell motility is downregulated
  upon mAR activation through the FAK/PI3K/Rac1 signaling pathway. In the absence
  of AR-driven signaling, EGFR induces PKC-mediated ERK1/2 activation and PN-1 expression
  to suppress cell motility. ERβ also inhibits cell motility through induction of
  integrin α1β1. The red arrows indicate Erβ/ integrin α1β1 pathway; The purple arrows
  indicate EGF/EGFR/PKC/ERK1/2/PN-1 pathway
