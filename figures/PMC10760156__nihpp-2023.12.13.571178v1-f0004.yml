figure_title: Distinct brain capillary endothelial states associate with healthy aging
  versus neurodegenerative diseases
caption: (A) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) clustering representation
  of brain endothelial cell subtypes, encompassing capillaries, veins, and arteries,
  derived from ~39K cells in the inCITE dataset, with disease state regressed out.
  (B) Heatmap showing identification markers for capillary endothelial cell subtypes.
  (C) in silico isolation of capillary nuclei and UMAP clustering based on batch corrected
  gene expression patterns and without regression of disease state. Data represents
  ~26K cells and feature plots of gene expression for cluster marker genes enriched
  in cluster 1 or cluster 3 relative to others. (D) Scatter plot showing correlation
  (Spearmann) between donor age and contribution to each capillary cluster, and (E)
  box plot showing the proportions of capillary endothelial cells for each donor falling
  into each cluster. (F) Bubble plot showing pathway enrichment from MsigDB in disease
  associated cluster 1 versus all other clusters. (E) ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test,
  ***P<0.001, *P<0.05
