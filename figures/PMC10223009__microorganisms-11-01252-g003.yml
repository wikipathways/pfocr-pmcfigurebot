caption: 'Metabolic engineering strategies for xanthophyll synthesis in model microorganisms
  illustrating five levels: protein engineering of key enzymes, compartmentalization
  of metabolic pathway, enhancement of metabolic flux, network regulation of metabolic
  pathway, and selection of microbial hosts. Protein engineering of key enzymes: directed
  evolution, truncation, or fusion expression is used to manipulate the enzyme protein
  through the color-based screening or yield comparison, obtaining an enzyme with
  improved catalytic activity. Dashed box: rational design of enzymes based on three-dimensional
  structure of proteins and computer modeling for rapid acquisition of improved enzymes.
  Compartmentalization of metabolic pathway: localization of metabolic pathways to
  various organelles, exploiting the different characteristics of various organelles
  to improve reaction efficiency, increase storage capacity, and reduce cytotoxicity.
  Dashed box: glycosylation of xanthophyll or engineering transport to promote xanthophyll
  solubilization or secretion, breaking through various regulatory barriers of the
  host. Enhancement of metabolic flux: breaking the metabolic flux bottleneck by increasing
  the gene copy number of the rate-limiting enzyme. Network regulation of metabolic
  pathway (in dashed box): based on omics data and regulatory elements, regulating
  the metabolic network at a holistic level to adapt host cell to the xanthophyll
  synthetic pathway. Selection of microbial hosts: microbial hosts are selected according
  to different research purposes (e.g., characterization of enzyme function, validation
  of metabolic pathway availability and regulatory circuits, high yield, etc.). Dashed
  box: custom synthesized organelles specifically for xanthophyll synthesis in microbial
  host, and in vitro synthesis of xanthophyll using a cell-free system. Future prospect:
  upgrade of industrial production model from “Black Pollution” to “Green Fortune”.
  The dotted line indicates future research directions for the new strategies'
