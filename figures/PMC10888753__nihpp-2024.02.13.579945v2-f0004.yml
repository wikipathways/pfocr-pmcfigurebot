figure_title: Genes selectively express many isoforms per tissue
caption: |-
  We selected all genes expressing >5 isoforms in ≥1 tissue. (a) Clustered heatmap showing isoform diversity (i.e., number of isoforms, not expression values) to identify gene clusters that preferentially express many isoforms in specific tissues. Dark purple indicates ≥7 distinct isoforms. Each tissue set had a representative cluster. One gene (MIR9–1HG) expressed 36 isoforms in putamen. (b) Metascape pathway analysis for liver cluster shows enrichment for genes associated with immune response, including the complement system and SARS-CoV-2 signaling pathway. (c) Total gene expression and the number of isoforms expressed were correlated; left ventricle shown as representative sample (Spearman’s p = 4.38e-48; see Supplemental Figure 18 for other tissues). We cannot determine cause and effect from these data alone, however, but can only conclude the two are correlated. Figures (d-e) show two representative gene examples from our R Shiny app (https://ebbertlab.com/gtex_rna_isoform_seq.html) expressing many isoforms within a single tissue, but with distinct expression patterns. For both genes (PAX6 & TPM1), it is unclear whether overall gene expression is driving the high number of expressed isoforms or if the need for multiple isoforms causes a higher gene expression, but demonstrates the need to determine whether individual isoforms are biologically functional. (d)
  PAX6 expressed 16 isoforms in cerebellar hemisphere; we highlight the top 5, here (see full plot in Supplemental Figure 8). (e)
  TPM1 expressed 16 and 19 isoforms in left ventricle and atrial appendage, respectively. We highlight three TPM1 isoforms showing preferential isoform expression across distinct tissue sets (see full plot in Supplemental Figure 14)
