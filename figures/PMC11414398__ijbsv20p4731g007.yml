caption: The alternative Src regulatory pathway mediated by the METTL18-RPL3-HSP90-actin
  axis in HER2-negative breast cancers. HER2-negative breast cancer expresses more
  METTL18 proteins than normal tissues and other breast cancer subtypes. METTL18 is
  responsible for RPL3 methylation at the histidine 245 residue, and that modification
  prompts the maintenance of HSP90 protein integrity. The increased HSP90 protein
  levels lead to actin polymerization. Actin filaments interact with the SH2 domain
  in the Src kinase, generating biphosphorylated Src with kinase activity. Ultimately,
  the biphosphorylated Src kinase increases the metastatic capacity of HER2-negative
  breast cancer, resulting in a poor prognosis
