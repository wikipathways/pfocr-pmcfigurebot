caption: The biosynthetic pathway of the active moult hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone,
  in Panulirus ornatus, highlighting the molecular structure changes (left) through
  a series of chemical reactions catalysed by Cytochrome P450s (outlined in green).
  The majority of the steps in this pathway (blue box) occur predominantly within
  the Y-organs (endocrine glands depicted by red marks) which is homologous to the
  prothoracic glands of insects. The initial reactions are synthesized by unknown
  enzymes, thus named the “black box” (outlined in black). The final conversion to
  the active moult hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (orange box), takes place in the target
  tissues
