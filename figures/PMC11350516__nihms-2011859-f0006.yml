figure_title: L-BAIBA induces Fgf23 mRNA via Gαs/cAMP/PKA/CBP/β-catenin and Gαq/PKC/CREB
  signaling pathways downstream of MRGPRD
caption: (A) RT-qPCR analysis of Fgf23 mRNA in day-28 IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM L-BAIBA
  in the presence of PKI5–24, a PKA inhibitor. PKA inhibitor blocked L-BAIBA-induced
  Fgf23 mRNA expression. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 4 biological replicates
  per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) are calculated
  using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(B and C) Immunoblotting of
  phosphorylated β-catenin (Ser675, activated form) and total β-catenin (B) in a whole-cell
  lysate prepared from IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM L-BAIBA. (C) Quantification of the
  immunoblots. Phosphorylation levels of β-catenin at Ser675 were increased 4-fold
  after 6 h, which was normalized by total β-catenin expression levels. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01) are calculated using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons.(D
  and E) Immunoblotting of phosphorylated β-catenin (Ser675) and total β-catenin (D)
  in a whole-cell lysate prepared from IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM L-BAIBA in the presence
  of 100 nM melittin and 50 nM PKI5–24, Gαs, and PKA inhibitors, respectively. (E)
  Quantification of the immunoblots. Both Gαs and PKA inhibitors blocked L-BAIBA-induced
  phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser675. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological
  replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001) are calculated
  using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(F) RT-qPCR analysis of Fgf23
  mRNA in day-28 IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM L-BAIBA in the presence of ICG-001, a
  β-catenin inhibitor. High doses of ICG-001 blocked L-BAIBA-induced Fgf23 mRNA expression.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates per condition), and
  p values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) are calculated using two-way ANOVA
  with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(G) RT-qPCR analysis of Fgf23 mRNA in day-28 IDG-SW3
  treated with 10 μM L-BAIBA in the presence of Go6983, a PKC inhibitor. Go6983 blocked
  L-BAIBA-induced Fgf23 mRNA expression. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological
  replicates per condition), and p values (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) are calculated
  using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(H and I) Immunoblotting of
  phosphorylated CREB (Ser133) and total CREB (H) in a whole-cell lysate prepared
  from IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM L-BAIBA for 3, 6, and 24 h. (I) Quantification of
  the immunoblots. L-BAIBA enhanced phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 at 24 h. Data
  are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates per condition), and p values
  (*p < 0.05) are calculated using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons.(J
  and K) Immunoblotting of phosphorylated CREB (Ser133) and total CREB (J) in a whole-cell
  lysate prepared from IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM L-BAIBA in the presence of 100 nM
  ebselen, a Gαq inhibitor. (K) Quantification of the immunoblots. Ebselen inhibited
  L-BAIBA-induced phosphorylation of CREB. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3
  biological replicates per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001) are
  calculated using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(L and M) Immunoblotting
  of phosphorylated CREB (Ser133) and total CREB (L) in a whole-cell lysate prepared
  from IDG-SW3 treated with 10 μM L-BAIBA in the presence of 100 nM Go6983, a PKC
  inhibitor. (M) Quantification of the immunoblots. Go6983 blocked L-BAIBA-induced
  phosphorylation of CREB. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates
  per condition), and p values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) are calculated using two-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.(N) BAIBA signaling pathway. L-BAIBA utilizes
  Gαs/cAMP/PKA/CBP/β-catenin and Gαq/PKC/CREB signaling pathways downstream of MRGPRD
  to regulate Fgf23 mRNA. Melittin is an inhibitor for Gαs, ebselen for Gαq, PKI5–24
  for PKA, Go6983 for PKC, and ICG-001 for CBP/β-catenin, used in this study
