caption: 'Euler diagram analysis assessing the relationship among different pathways
  identified in this study. (A) represents genes in the following pathways: IFN signaling,
  IFN alpha/beta signaling, IFN gamma signaling, antiviral mechanisms by IFN-stimulated
  genes (ISGs), and regulation of IFNA/IFNB signaling. (B) DDX58/IFIH1-mediated induction
  of IFN alpha/beta. (C) Class I MHC-mediated antigen and presentation and antigen
  processing: ubiquitination and proteosome degradation. (D) Programed cell death
  and regulated necrosis. (E) Death receptor signaling'
