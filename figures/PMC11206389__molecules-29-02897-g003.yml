figure_title: Effects of OMT on LPS/ATP-induced NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in primary
  cultured rat peritoneal macrophages.
caption: 'Effects of OMT on LPS/ATP-induced NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in primary cultured
  rat peritoneal macrophages. (A) Representative images of PI staining of rat peritoneal
  macrophages (scale bar: 100 μm). Model, LPS/ATP stimulation with 3 mM ATP for 30
  min after 10 μg mL−1 LPS pretreatment for 12 h; OMT, oxymatrine pretreatment for
  1 h before LPS/ATP stimulation. (B) Percentage of PI-positive cells from primary
  peritoneal macrophage cultures (n = 4). Data are shown as mean ± SE. Compared to
  the model group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. Compared to the control group, ### p <
  0.001. (C) Western blot analysis of the proteins of NLRP3 signaling pathway with
  the cultured rat peritoneal macrophage lysates'
