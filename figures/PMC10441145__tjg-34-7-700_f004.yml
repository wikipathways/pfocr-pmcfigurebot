figure_title: (A) Bubble point map of gene ontology function nodes with significant
  enrichment of overlapping genes.
caption: (A) Bubble point map of gene ontology function nodes with significant enrichment
  of overlapping genes. The horizontal axis represents rich factors, and the vertical
  axis represents the name of the item. The size of the point represents the number
  of genes involved. The larger the point, the more the number of genes; the color
  of the dots represents the correlation, and the closer the color is to red, the
  higher the significance. (B) KEGG signaling pathway pie chart with significant enrichment
  of overlapping genes. Each component represents a different KEGG pathway, the number
  represents the genes number involved in the pathway, the color represents significance,
  and the closer to red, the higher the significance
