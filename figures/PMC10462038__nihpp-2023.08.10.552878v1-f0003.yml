figure_title: Identification of intra-tumoral heterogeneity
caption: A) Violin plot of collected cell-layer marker genes; B) The expression levels
  of the top 5 up-regulated DEGs in each epithelial cluster; C) Functional enrichment
  analysis for KEGG showing the up-regulated signaling pathways differential regulated
  across epithelial clusters, the color scale indicating log combined scores of the
  pathway, value zero indicating no pathway identified in the corresponding cluster;
  D) Volcano plot showing the differentially expressed genes between Epi_2 over Epi_8.
  The dashed line indicates the threshold of significant gene expression, defined
  as the absolute value of log fold change >0.25 with âˆ’log10(p) >1.3; E) BP in GO
  term showing the signaling pathway that is differentially regulated in cells of
  Epi_2 versus Epi_8
