figure_title: The intestinal barrier function is damaged under heat stress.
caption: The intestinal barrier function is damaged under heat stress. (A–F). The
  intestinal morphology (distal gut) of the CO group and HS group was observed under
  TEM; microvilli (); mitochondria (Mi); rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER); tight
  junction (); desmosome junction (); mitochondrial structure ambiguity (); absorptive
  cell (); secretory granules (); cell nucleus (N);there was no obvious microvillus
  structure on the free surface of cells ();. (G) The altered intestinal permeability
  signaling pathways in the HS groups compared with CO groups by enrichment analysis.
  (H,I). The effect of LPS and DAO in serum and intestinal contents on intestinal
  permeability was determined by ELISA. (J–L). The relative mRNA expression abundance
  of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin in the intestine was detected by qRT-PCR. The reference
  gene is β-actin. Data are expressed as means ± SD. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001
  using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s HSD test. CO, control
  groups; HS, heat stress groups
