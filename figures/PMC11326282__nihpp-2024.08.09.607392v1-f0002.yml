figure_title: Partial loss of ZCRB1 leads to downregulation of splicing factors and
  upregulation of Wnt signalinga.
caption: Partial loss of ZCRB1 leads to downregulation of splicing factors and upregulation
  of Wnt signalinga. Volcano plot of differentially expressed (DE) genes identified
  by RNA-seq analysis between heterozygous ZCRB1 knockout Hek293 Flp-In cells and
  WT cells. The red and blue dots denote significantly upregulated and downregulated
  genes, respectively, while the grey dots denote genes with no measure significant
  change. The horizontal dashed lines represent the cut off for significant fold change
  (≥ absolute log2 fold change of .58), while the horizontal line signifies the FDR
  significance cut-off (≤ 0.05).b. Barplot of DE genes belonging to or primarily associated
  to both the major and minor Human spliceosomes (FDR ≤ 0.05 and absolute linear fold
  change ≥ .1.5) as identified by RNA-seq analysis. Red and blue bars, upregulated
  and downregulated linear foldchanges, respectively. The color intensity denotes
  the degree of expression change. The FDR values for each expression level are displayed
  next to their respective bars.c. Barplot of DE genes present in the canonical and
  non-canonical Human Wnt pathway (FDR ≤ 0.05 and absolute linear fold change ≥ .1.5)
  as identified by RNA-seq analysis. Red and blue bars, upregulated and downregulated
  linear foldchanges, respectively. The color intensity denotes the degree of expression
  change. The FDR values for each expression level are displayed next to their respective
  bars.d. Western blot analysis of Wnt signaling factors in ZCRB1 heterozygous knockout
  cells. Protein for each labeled protein is shown for WT HEK293 flp-In cells and
  33, 63, 54, 63, and PL3C7 clones, respectively. Molecular weight markers (kDa) are
  shown. Equal protein was used for analysis and was normalized using Ponceau S staining
  as shown
