caption: '(a) Summary of metabolic pathway analysis using metabolites detected through
  NMR measurements. The pathways are plotted as nodes according to p-values as significance
  on the y-axis and pathway impact values on the x-axis. Node color is based on p-value
  and node radius is determined based on pathway impact value. Most contributing pathways
  are in the top right corner. Each node represents the following metabolic and biosynthetic
  pathways: I—alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; II—pyruvate metabolism;
  III—arginine biosynthesis; IV—glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; V—starch
  and sucrose metabolism; VI—glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; VII—glycolysis
  or gluconeogenesis; VIII—inositol phosphate metabolism; and IX—fructose and mannose
  metabolism. (b) Pathway-based network constructed from the results of the pathway
  analysis. The green nodes indicate metabolites detected through NMR spectra; double-circled
  nodes indicate metabolites detected through iSQC-sliced spectra. Blue blocks represent
  metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, and nodes related to these are grouped together.
  Arrows connecting nodes indicate the direction of metabolism or biosynthesis. Purple
  nodes represent the urea cycle and the TCA cycle, and related nodes are connected
  by dotted lines'
