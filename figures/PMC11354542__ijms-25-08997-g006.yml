caption: 'Neurotrophin-signaling pathways in the high-intensity exercise group (blue:
  downregulation). The Raf and IRAK genes were downregulated. The neurotrophin signaling
  pathway was elicited with the KEGG Mapper Search and Color Pathway tool (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html,
  accessed on 19 December 2020)'
