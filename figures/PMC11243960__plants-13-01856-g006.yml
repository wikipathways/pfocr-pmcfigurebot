  stress.
caption: 'G2-like TFs strongly correlate with DEGs in the Calvin cycle under UV-B
  stress. (a) Heatmap of DEGs in the Calvin cycle; (b) Analysis of differentially
  expressed genes of the Calvin cycle pathway in correlation with metabolites: red
  and blue colors indicate the strength of the correlation, the line on the left side
  indicates the Mantelâ€™s statistic, the thickness of the line reflects the correlation
  between differentially expressed genes (indicated by enzyme number) and metabolites,
  and the color of the line indicates the degree of significance. (EC5.3.1.6: ribose-5-phosphate
  isomerase; EC4.1.1.39: ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase; EC4.1.2.13: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
  aldolase; EC3.1.3.11: fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase)'
