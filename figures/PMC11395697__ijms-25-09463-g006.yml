caption: Mechanisms underlying the hallmarks of colorectal cancer progression. Colorectal
  cancer (CRC) is a complex and multifaceted disease characterized by the acquisition
  of various hallmark capabilities that enable tumor growth, progression, and metastasis.
  Sustained proliferative signaling in CRC tumors is driven by modifying mechanisms
  like cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence, and apoptosis, while evasion of
  growth suppressors occurs through disruptions in tumor suppressors like TP53 and
  APC. Resistance to cell death is facilitated by dysregulation of apoptotic machinery
  and BCL-2 family members, and replicative immortality is enabled by deregulation
  of pathways like WNT, RAS, and PI3K. Angiogenesis is induced by factors like VEGF
  and hypoxic conditions, while invasion and metastasis involve epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition, altered cell–cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Deregulation
  of cellular energetics, such as the Warburg effect, provides a growth advantage,
  and immune evasion is mediated by mechanisms like PD-L1 upregulation. A tumor-promoting
  inflammatory microenvironment is created by cytokines, chemokines, and immune cell
  infiltration, while genomic instability and tumor progression are driven by the
  accumulation of mutations in genes like APC, KRAS, and TP53. The image further depicts
  emerging hallmarks specific to CRC, including the distinct molecular features of
  left-sided and right-sided tumors, unique characteristics of rectal cancer, and
  the involvement of signaling pathways like Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, and TGF-β in disease
  progression. Figure created using BioRender
