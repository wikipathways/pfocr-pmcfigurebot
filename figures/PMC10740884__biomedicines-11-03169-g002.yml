figure_title: Production of uric acid.
caption: Production of uric acid. At the end of the purine metabolic pathway, uric
  acid is produced from hypoxanthine and xanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR).
  Uric acid is an end product in humans due to a defect in urate oxidase (UOX) and
  is excreted from the kidney and intestine. Along this pathway, XOR produces reactive
  oxygen species (ROSs) as a pro-oxidative effect. Uric acid has both anti-oxidative
  and pro-oxidative effects against ROS. Slightly soluble uric acid, which has low
  solubility in human serum, occasionally forms crystals before being excreted from
  the body
