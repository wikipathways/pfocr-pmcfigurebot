caption: Antagonism of PI3K pathway promotes apoptosis in canine aVICs. aVICs were
  treated with DMSO (Control), LY294002 (60 μM), copanlisib (5 μM) and alpelisib (50 μM)
  for 3 days. (A, B) Representative confocal images of TUNEL (red) staining and quantitative
  analysis of the percentage of TUNEL positive (apoptotic) cells (arrowhead), scale
  bar 20 μm (n = 12 microscopic fields/treatment). (C) Flow cytometry analysis of
  TUNEL staining and quantification of the percentage of apoptotic cells at Day 3
  (n = 3). (D–F) Representative western blot of caspase‐3, cleaved caspase‐3 and β‐Actin
  protein expression and quantification of the relative protein expression (n = 6).
  (G) Quantitative RT‐PCR for caspase‐3 mRNA expression in aVICs treated with PI3K
  inhibitors after 3 days (n = 6). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA followed
  by Tukey's range test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to control.
  ANOVA, analysis of variance; aVIC, activated myofibroblast phenotype.

  and secretory phenotype of valvular interstitial cells through the modulation of
  cellular senescence in a naturally occurring in vitro canine model of myxomatous
  mitral valve disease.
