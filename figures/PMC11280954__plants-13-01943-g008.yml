figure_title: Effect of the infusion on the nuclear accumulation of the phosphorylated
  form of H2AX (γH2AX) and p53/p21 signaling pathway.
caption: 'Effect of the infusion on the nuclear accumulation of the phosphorylated
  form of H2AX (γH2AX) and p53/p21 signaling pathway. The addition of S. impressa
  infusion in the recovery phase led to a decrease in the nuclear accumulation of
  γH2AX (A,B) and in the protein levels of p53 (C,D) and p21 (C,E). Tubulin was used
  as loading control and values were normalized to etoposide. n = 3. Six images were
  analyzed per condition. #### p < 0.0001, compared to control (CT); **** p < 0.0001,
  compared to Eto 12.5 µM; one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test. Scale bar: 10 µm'
