caption: Further analysis of the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis
  and phenylalanine metabolism pathways and their qPCR validation. (A) Heatmap of
  the clustering of DEGs involved in the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis
  and phenylalanine metabolism pathways. DEGs involved in both pathways are marked
  in red. (B) Bar graphs and histograms of the expression trends of DEMs in these
  two pathways in ZC17 and CH72. The symbol “***” indicates significant differences
  (p < 0.001, n = 6) between two groups, based on Student’s t-test. (C) Histogram
  of the fold change of DEGs in transcriptome sequencing and qPCR results. (D) Spearman
  rank correlation analysis showed high concordance between the RNA-seq and qPCR results
