  during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.
caption: Effect of the PPIase activity of CypB on AKT/mTOR signaling pathway during
  the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. The cells were induced to differentiate into
  adipocytes with a 24 h MDI treatment. The molecules involved in the AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway, specifically p-AKT, p-mTOR, and p-p70S6K, were observed in both CypB/WT
  and CypB/R95A through Western blotting. The protein band intensities were measured
  using ImageJ software and the values were adjusted based on vinculin expression.
  The results are expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation from six individual experiments
