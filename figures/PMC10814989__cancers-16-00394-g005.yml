caption: Microbial-associated adherens junction and signaling pathway dysregulation.
  (A) Enrichment plots showing the running enrichment score of select microbes to
  the adherens junction (top) and WNT signaling (bottom) pathways. Lines represent
  microbes. Only the ten microbes of the greatest significance in differential abundance
  are shown. Both pathways are positively enriched with respect to a majority of the
  microbes analyzed. (B) Strip charts of microbe–gene set correlations. Genes of the
  adherens junction (top) and WNT signaling (bottom) pathways are shown. p-values
  are plotted. Each point represents a microbe–gene combination, with sizes and colors
  indicating their correlation coefficients (R-value). Only differentially abundant
  microbes were chosen for analysis. Gene sets show positive correlation to a vast
  majority of the differentially abundant species
