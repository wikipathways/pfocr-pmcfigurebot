figure_title: The effects of dihydroaustrasulfone alcohol (DA) on the inactivation
  of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in NPC-39 cells
caption: NPC-39 cells were treated for 24 h with various doses of DA. (A) Cell lysates
  were collected, and the expression of phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated PI3K and
  AKT proteins was determined by Western blot analysis. GAPDH was used as a loading
  control. (B) Western blot signal intensity quantification *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001 indicate significant differences compared to the DMSO-treated control
  group. (C) Active AKT cDNA-transfected cells were lysed, and the protein extracts
  were subjected to protein gel blot analysis using antibodies against the appropriate
  protein after being treated with 25 µM DA for 24 h. GAPDH was used as a loading
  control. (D, E) Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) binding was investigated using
  flow cytometry. (F) The MTT assay was used to determine cell viability. The results
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation, and all samples were measured independently
  in triplicate. The difference between the DA and active AKT+ DA groups was **p <
  0.01 (Student’s t-test)
