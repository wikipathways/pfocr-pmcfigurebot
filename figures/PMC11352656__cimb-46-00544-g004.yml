  factor signaling pathway in the thymus tissue of Cobb 500 broilers.
caption: 'Effects of heat stress and astaxanthin treatment in the NF-kB transcription
  factor signaling pathway in the thymus tissue of Cobb 500 broilers. Three groups
  were compared: TN, HS, and HSAX. Dunn post hoc test for pair-wise comparison of
  statistical significance represented the following: (A) NFKB1, TN vs. HS (p = 0.028),
  HS vs. HSAX (p = 0.028); (B) RELA, TN vs. HS (p = 0.009); (C) IKBKB, TN vs. HS (p
  = 0.011). * Differences between treatments significant at p < 0.05; ** differences
  between treatments significant at p < 0.01'
