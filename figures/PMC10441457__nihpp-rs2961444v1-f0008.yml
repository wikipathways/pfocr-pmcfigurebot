figure_title: Both iMSC and iAAT-MSC suppressed TNBS-induced ferroptosis via modulating
  ROS signaling pathway in acinar cells
caption: (A) ROS formation was measured by the relationship between the incubation
  time in the presence of dihydrorhodamine (DHR)-123 and the fluorescence at 485/528
  nm after treatment. (B)Snapshots from a live cell imaging of four groups of AR42J
  cells treated with DHR-123. Green fluorescence staining represents ROS production
  (arrows) once the probe was oxidized to rhodamine-123 (rhod 123) (Bar= 50 μm). (C)Flow
  cytometric analysis of ROS formation on live-gated cells after treatment of AR42J
  cells in four groups with non-fluorescent DHR-123. (D) CDF curve diagram showed
  the comparable fluorescence signals in four treatment groups of AR42J cells with
  DHR-123. (E-G) Accumulation of lipid peroxidases (MDA) and iron in four groups of
  AR42€ells. (E) MDA levels were determined by MDA Assay Kit. (F) Prussian blue assessment
  of ferrous ions accumulation in treated cells (arrows) (Bar= 50 μm and 25 μm). (G)
  Quantification of iron-positive cells from Prussian blue-stained samples. Data represent
  the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 vs. TNBS-treated AR42J cell group)
