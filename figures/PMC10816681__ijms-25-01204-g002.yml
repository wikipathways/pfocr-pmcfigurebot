  pig by CellChat.
caption: Communication network construction for the LD of the newborn Suhuai pig by
  CellChat. (A) The number of interaction plot of LD cells. The left graph is the
  number of interactions and the right graph is the interaction strength between different
  cell types. The top and right colored bar plots represent the sum of values displayed
  in the heatmap. (B) Projecting signaling pathways onto a two-dimensional manifold
  based on their functional similarity. Each dot represents the communication network
  of one signaling pathway. Dot size is proportional to the overall communication
  probability. Different colors represent different groups of signaling pathways.
  (C) Heatmap showing the outgoing communication patterns of secreting cells in LD.
  The relation between 5 inferred potential patterns with different cell populations
  (left) or signaling pathways (right) were shown. (D) Heatmap showing the incoming
  communication patterns of target cells in LD. The relation between 6 inferred potential
  patterns with different cell populations (left) or signaling pathways (right) were
  shown. (E–H) Communication network of 4 secretion (sender)/targeting (receiver)
  pathways in FAPs and pericytes, respectively. Each node (circle) represents a distinct
  cell type, while the connecting lines (edges) depict the known or hypothesized interactions.
  The thickness of the lines indicates the strength or frequency of interactions,
  and the different colors represent different types or subtypes of interactions.
  (I) The expression distribution of four signaling pathway related genes in different
  cell type in LD, including PERIOSTIN pathway (POSTN, ITGAV, ITGB5), ANGPT pathway
  (ANGPT2, TEK, ITGA5, ITGB1), AGT pathway (AGT, AGTR1), and VEGF pathway (VEGFB,
  VEGFC, VEGFD, FLT1, KDR). (J) Relative contribution of each ligand–receptor pair
  to the overall signaling network in LD
