figure_title: Chrysin disrupts the ATM/ATR signaling pathway.
caption: 'Chrysin disrupts the ATM/ATR signaling pathway. (A) Immunoblot analysis
  of ATM, phospho-ATM (pS1981-ATM), ATR, phosphor-ATR (pS428-ATR), Chk1, phospho-Chk1
  (pS345-Chk1), Chk2, phosphor-Chk2 (pT68-Chk2), p53, phosphor-p53 (pS15-P53), p21Cip1,
  phosphor-p21Cip1, phosphor-H2AX (pS139-H2AX), Pro-PARP, and cleaved PARP (c-PARP)
  in MelC cells treated with a medium containing the solvent (0.1% DMSO) or with increasing
  concentrations (20, 40, and 80 µM) of chrysin (CH) for 72 h. GAPDH was used as a
  loading control. The numbers below indicate the average value of the intensity of
  the bands of 3 independent immunoblotting operations compared to the solvent control
  set at a value of 1. (B) Densitometry quantification of Western blotting. Data are
  expressed as the mean fold induction ± SEM of three independent experiments. p values
  were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. *
  p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; and **** p < 0.0001; n.s.: not significant'
