  analysis of DEGs of UVB and CK tubers. (A,B) GO analysis of up-regulated and down-regulated
  DEGs. Top 20 GO terms are displayed for each. (C,D) KEGG analysis of up-regulated
  and down-regulated DEGs. All KEGG pathways are shown. The dot size and color indicate
  the number of genes, and the p-value, respectively
