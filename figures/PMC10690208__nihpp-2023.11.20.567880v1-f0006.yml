caption: 'a. The circos plot indicates the perturbed regions and identified primary
  targets in (ER+) MDA-MB-361 cells and (ER−) MDA-MB-231 cells.b. The scatterplot
  indicates p-values of direct targets in the two cell lines. The large number of
  off-diagonal points indicates that enhancer expression phenotypes are significantly
  cell line specific.c. Genome Browser snapshots of the TSPAN1 locus in the two cell
  lines.d. Bulk qPCR experiments show TSPAN1 enhancer regulates TSPAN1 in both (ER+)
  MDA-MB-361 and (ER−) MDA-MB-231 cell lines. To facilitate comparison, we copied
  the MDA-MB-361 data from Figure 2F. (NC: non-target control sgRNA, 3 biological
  replicates, * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001, Student’s t-test).e. Clustering
  analysis of global hits between perturbed regions in (ER+) MDA-MB-361 cells.f. Clustering
  analysis of global hits between perturbed regions in (ER−) MDA-MB-231 cells.g. Clustering
  analysis of global hits between (ER+) MDA-MB-361 and (ER−) MDA-MB-231.h. The overlapping
  genes of MDA-MB-361 somatic mutation gene program 4 (Fig. 1j) and MDA-MB-231 GWAS
  gene program 3 (Supplementary Fig. 9d). Both programs are related to immune response,
  but only 5 genes are common in these cell lines.i. The overlapping genes of MDA-MB-361
  somatic mutation gene program 2 (Fig. 1j) and MDA-MB-231 somatic mutation gene program
  2 (Supplementary Fig. 9b). The DREAM target pathway is shared across two breast
  cancer cell lines, and many of them are overlapping.j. Comparison of perturbation
  modules that down-regulated DREAM targets gene program in MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-231
  somatic mutation screens. Module 0 in MDA-MB-361 is able to down-regulate DREAM
  targets (Fig. 1i) while module 2 in MDA-MB-231 cells plays a similar role (Supplementary
  Fig. 9a). The numerical labels correspond to perturbation regions'
