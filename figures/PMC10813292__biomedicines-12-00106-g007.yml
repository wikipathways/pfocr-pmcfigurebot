  In injured pancreatic acinar cells, nuclear factor kappa of activated B cells (NF-κB)
  acts as a transcription factor activated by redox system signaling. NF-κB is involved
  in the M1 polarization of macrophages that modulates a pro-inflammatory cytokine
  over-response. Also, NF-κB up-regulates the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
  and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and, consequently, of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6
  (IL-6) that promotes the release of acute-phase proteins such as CRP and ferritin
