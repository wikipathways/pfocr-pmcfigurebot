caption: Hypothetical model of LOX activity in promoting tumour progression in breast
  cancer. LOX is secreted as an inactive proLOX into the ECM where it is cleaved by
  BMP-1 to become the catalytically active LOX enzyme. Subsequently, active LOX can
  either translocate into the cell or remain in the ECM. Currently, it is not known
  where LOX target substrates localize. Subsequent catalytic interaction with substrate
  produces hydrogen peroxide and stimulates Src activation. Activated Src subsequently
  activates FAK (leading to changes in cell-matrix adhesion) and/or activates the
  p130Cas/Crk/DOCK180 signaling pathway (facilitating actin filament formation). Activation
  of Src may also lead to activation of the STAT3 and NFkB; however, this has not
  been validated in breast cancer cells. Together, stimulation of these pathways by
  LOX leads to cell motility and tumour progression in breast cancer. Extracellular
  matrix (ECM); bone morphogenic protein-1 (BMP-1); focal adhesion kinase (FAK); sarcoma
  gene (Src); signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3); nuclear
  factor kappa B (NFkB)
