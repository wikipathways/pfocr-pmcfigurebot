caption: Diagram showing the proposed mechanism by which the Ercc1Δ/− mutation induced
  progeria and inhibition of the activin signalling pathway by sActRIIB-regulated
  gene expression related to oxidative stress and myocyte remodelling. In this schematic,
  genomic DNA damage results in mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. This is
  associated with decreased expression of tissue antioxidants, while increasing pro-oxidant
  genes, resulting in increased oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction. DNA damage
  also results in the upregulation of anti-hypertrophic genes, whilst reducing pro-hypertrophic
  genes. This results in myocyte atrophy and a reduced contractile function. On the
  other hand, sActRIIB treatment results in an upregulation of antioxidants, whilst
  also reducing pro-oxidant genes. In parallel, sActRIIB treatment also shifts the
  balance in favour of myocyte hypertrophy by decreasing the expression of anti-hypertrophic
  genes, whilst increasing pro-hypertrophic genes. This increases cardiac systolic
  function. Therefore, the combined effects of sActRIIB treatment on oxidative stress
  and myocyte hypertrophy result in improved tissue morphology and contractile function.
  The genes affected by inhibition of activin signalling via sActRIIB treatment are
  shown in red.
