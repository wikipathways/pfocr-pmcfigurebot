caption: Metabolic reprogramming induced by genetic alterations and interactions with
  the tumor microenvironment in thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer cells manifest distinct
  metabolic changes, such as elevated glycolysis (the Warburg effect) and alterations
  in crucial metabolic pathways, contributing to therapeutic resistance and oncogenic
  progression. These metabolic shifts are influenced by genetic alterations, including
  the BRAFV600E mutation, RET/papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) rearrangements, MYC overexpression,
  and RAS mutations. The tumor microenvironment (TME), comprising diverse cellular
  components such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), extracellular matrix (ECM),
  endothelial cells, and immune cells, plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and
  response to therapy. A dynamic metabolic crosstalk within the TME is essential for
  tumor development. The metabolic reprogramming of immune cells significantly affects
  their anti-tumor activity. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for
  developing targeted cancer therapies. OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; PPP, pentose
