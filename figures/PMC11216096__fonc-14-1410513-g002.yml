caption: The roles of Wnt pathway members and Wnt-targeted agents in gastric cancer.
  Wnt ligands and FZD receptors are altered in gastric cancer. The background colors
  of the following various Wnt-targeted agents are shown in light blue boxes. DKKs
  and PORCNi are Wnt ligand antagonists, pAb5a-5 targets and inhibits WNT5A, Ad5/35-DKK1
  delivers DKK1, miR-132–3p and miR-140–5p inhibit WNT1, miR-491–5p inhibits Wnt3a,
  and miR-876–5p and mi-26a-5p inhibit WNT5A. OMP-18R5 targets and inhibits the FZD
  receptor, Fz7–21 inhibits FZD7. OMP-54F28 inhibits FZD8. CCT5 inhibits β-catenin
  adhesion to E-cadherin, salinomycin inhibits LRP5/6, and OMP131-R10 inhibits the
  Znrf3-/Rnf43-scavenging effect of RSPO. M435–1279 inhibits UBT2T-induces β-catenin
  accumulation in the nucleus. XAV939 promotes β-catenin degradation. iCRT3/5 and
  LF3 inhibit the interaction of β-catenin and TCF4. 2,4-DAQ inhibits LEF1, and E7386
  inhibits the interaction between β-catenin and CBP.
