caption: 'Targeting PKP2 using GW9662 leads to the downregulation of the P38/MAPK
  signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis revealed that GW9662 markedly reduced
  the production of the PKP2 protein in HUVECs stimulated with LPS (data represent
  the results of three independent experiments). (B) GW9662 significantly reduced
  the mRNA expression of connexin43 and AQP3 in HUVECs overexpressing PKP2 upon LPS
  stimulation (data represent the results of three independent experiments). (C) In
  the presence of LPS, GW9662 substantially reduced the protein levels of ZO-1, p-p38/p38,
  and claudin1 in HUVECs overexpressing PKP2 and simultaneously enhanced cell permeability
  (data represent the results of three independent experiments). (D) After LPS stimulation,
  GW9662 induced cytoskeletal disruption in HUVECs overexpressing PKP2 (data represent
  the results of three independent experiments). (E) GW9662 increased the permeability
  of HUVECs overexpressing PKP2 upon LPS stimulation (data represent the results of
  three independent experiments). (F) GW9662 decreased the immunofluorescence intensity
  of claudin1 in HUVECs overexpressing PKP2 following LPS stimulation (data represent
  the results of three independent experiments). GW9662: antagonist of PPARÎ³. *p <
  0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p <0.0001.'
