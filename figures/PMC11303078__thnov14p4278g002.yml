figure_title: Hy-Exos inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and promote LPS-induced
  MODE-K cells recovery.
caption: Hy-Exos inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and promote LPS-induced
  MODE-K cells recovery. A-D. IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 expression in MODE-K cells
  was measured by PCR. E-F. MODE-K cells proliferation in each group was determined
  by EdU staining. Scale bar = 100 μm. G. MODE-K cells viability in each group was
  detected by CCK-8 assays. H. Volcano plot of DEGs in GSE75214. I. Heat map of DEGs
  in GSE75214. J-L. GO enrichment analysis of DEGs. M. KEGG enrichment analysis of
  DEGs. N-Q. Western blotting was used to measure p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR
  expression in MODE-K cells. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001)
