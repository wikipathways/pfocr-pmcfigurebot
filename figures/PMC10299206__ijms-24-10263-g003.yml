caption: Relationship between genes related to TGF-β signaling pathway and pathogenesis
  of oral cancers. The diagram outlines the relationship between genes related to
  the TGF-β signaling pathway and the pathogenesis of oral cancers, including OSCC,
  salivary adenoid systemic carcinoma, and KCOTs. Genes indicated in red might promote
  disease progression; genes indicated in blue might suppress disease progression
