  activation.
caption: Signaling pathways associated with the effect of GDF-15 on human platelet
  activation. (A) Representative Western blot images and statistical analysis for
  platelet phospho-/total ERK signaling pathway. (B) Representative Western blot images
  and statistical analysis for the platelet phospho-/total AKT signaling pathway.
  (C) Representative Western blot images and statistical analysis for the platelet
  phospho-/total JAK2 signaling pathway. CTRL indicates no treatment was given to
  the platelets. Platelets were treated with 20 ng/mL GDF-15 for 15 min and incubated
  with 5 μM ADP for 5 min. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ns means no significance. Data
  are shown as the mean ± SEM, n = 6. Original images of (A–C) can be found in Supplementary
