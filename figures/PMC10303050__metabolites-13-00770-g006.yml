figure_title: A two-dimensional principal component analysis (2-D PCA) biplot showing
  relationships amongst the explanatory variables (total metabolites involved in specific
  central carbon metabolic pathways) Calvin–Benson cycle (CBC), glycolysis, pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain
  (ETC) of Scotia tomato seedlings treated with pyroligneous acid (PA) under aluminum
  (Al) stress.
caption: A two-dimensional principal component analysis (2-D PCA) biplot showing relationships
  amongst the explanatory variables (total metabolites involved in specific central
  carbon metabolic pathways) Calvin–Benson cycle (CBC), glycolysis, pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC)
  of Scotia tomato seedlings treated with pyroligneous acid (PA) under aluminum (Al)
  stress. The projection of the variables in the 2-D factor space (F1 and F2) explained
  a total of 81.78% of the variations in the dataset. Variables that are closely located
  are not different compared to variables located at a distance within a quadrant
  or between quadrants
