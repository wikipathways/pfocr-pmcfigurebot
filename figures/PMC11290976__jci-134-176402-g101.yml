figure_title: PIK3CA gain-of-function mutation in podocytes is associated with changes
  in cell fate determination
caption: (A) Unsupervised clustering resulted in 20 distinct cell types in the UMAP
  plot. (B) Expression of cell-type-specific markers in the annotated clusters. The
  cell percentage expressing the gene is indicated by the dotâ€™s size, and the average
  expression of the gene is indicated by the color concentration. (C) Cell trajectory
  map of each podocyte cluster showing the pseudotime. The significant pathways resulting
  from the KEGG pathway analysis (see Supplemental Table 2) are displayed adjacent
  to podocyte clusters 1, 2, and 3
