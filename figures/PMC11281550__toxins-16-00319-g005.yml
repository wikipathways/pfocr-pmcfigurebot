caption: The metabolism pathway bubble plot of Caco-2 cells treated with TeA (A),
  PAT (B), and TeA + PAT (C). The x-coordinate and bubble size represent the influence
  factor size of the pathway in the topological analysis, and the y-coordinate and
  bubble color represent the p-value of the enrichment analysis. The larger the circle
  is, the greater the influence value is, and the deeper the color is, the more significant
  the result is
