caption: Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed specifically on
  genes co-expressed with Schlafen 5 (SLFN5) in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) TCGA
  patients. (A) The analysis involved gene ontology (GO) terms, including biological
  processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Circle sizes in the visual
  representation of the results indicate the number of genes associated with each
  function, while colors of the bubbles correspond to p values, providing information
  about the statistical significance of the enrichment. (B) Pathway analysis of SLFN5
  co-expressed genes in the KEGG database
