caption: 'Proposed genetic work model for maize stalk lodging resistance by integrating
  current knowledges. (A) The lignin synthesis pathway which is regarded as the important
  pathway influencing stalk lodging in maize. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H,
  cinnamate 4-hudroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate: CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl CoA reductase;
  CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; HCT, p-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA; C3H, p-coumarate
  3-hydroxylase: CCoADMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase. (B) The combined phytohormone
  metabolic pathways that work together to influence stalk lodging traits. GGPP, geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate; TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; P450, cytochrome p450; GA2ox,
  GA 2-oxidase; GA20ox, GA 20-oxidase; GA3ox, GA 3-oxidase; PIN, PIN-formed protein;
  JAZ, jasmonate ZIM-domain protein; MYC2, bHLHzip transcription factor MYC2; BZR1,
  brassinazole resistant 1; AN1, anther ear1; D3, dwarf plant 3; D8, dwarf plant8;
  D9, dwarf plant9; D14, strigolactone receptor D14; NA1, nana plant1; NA2, nana plant2.
  The enzymes involved in the lignin biosynthesis pathways in maize are shown in orange
  letters. The known proteins involved in hormone metabolic pathways are shown in
  red.'
