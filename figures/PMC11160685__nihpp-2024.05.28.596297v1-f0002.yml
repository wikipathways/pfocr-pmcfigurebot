figure_title: Circadian transcriptional rhythms and reprogramming of bulk cortex transcripts
  in WT and APP/PS1 mice
caption: A. Heatmaps showing transcripts that were rhythmic in bulk cortex tissue
  from WT mice (upper) and rhythmic in APP/PS1 mice (lower). In both rows of heatmaps,
  the genes plotted are in the same order to compare differences in rhythmic expression
  between mice. B-D. KEGG pathway analysis of cortex transcripts identified as rhythmic
  (by RAIN analysis) in (B) both WT and APP/PS1 mice, (C) WT mice, or (D) APP/PS1
  mice. E. Heatmap showing temporally-coordinated expression of KEGG lysosome pathway
  genes in bulk cortex from WT mice. F. Radar plot showing acrophase distributions
  of rhythmic bulk cortex transcripts from WT (grey) or APP/PS1 (orange) mice. G.
  Pie chart depicting the number of transcripts that gained or lost rhythms in different
  datasets, based on compareRhythms analysis of rhythmic transcripts in bulk tissue.
  A total of 2139 were identified as rhythmic by RAIN analysis across all datasets.
  H-K. Graphs showing circadian expression patterns of transcripts from bulk cortex
  from WT (grey) or APP/PS1 (orange) mice. H. Core clock genes Per2 and Arntl (Bmal1)
  remained rhythmic. I. Senescence marker Cdkn1a and glutathione transferase Gstt2
  lost rhythmicity in APP/PS1. J. Inflammatory transcripts Nfkbia and Ccl4 gained
  rhythmicity in APP/PS1. K. Endosomal gene Rab13 changed phase in APP/PS1. Adjusted
  P values from RAIN are shown. Each datapoint is the average of two mice, each from
  separate experiments
