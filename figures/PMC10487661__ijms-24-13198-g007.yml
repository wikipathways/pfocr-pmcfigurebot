figure_title: Differential expression of transcription factors involved in anthocyanidin
  and flavonoid pathways in different pericarps.
caption: Differential expression of transcription factors involved in anthocyanidin
  and flavonoid pathways in different pericarps. The heatmap was created according
  to the expression levels of related transcription factors based on the FPKM value.
  The color scale represents the FPKM value. Red indicates high expression, and green
  indicates low expression. BT is ‘Baitang’ (purple pericarp), JX is ‘Jinxuan’ (green
  pericarp), ZB is ‘Zhongbaiyihao’ (white pericarp)
