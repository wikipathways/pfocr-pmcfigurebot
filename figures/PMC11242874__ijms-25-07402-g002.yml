caption: (A) PCA of the transcriptomes of R/O and R/M. (B) Statistical analysis of
  the number of DEGs between R/O and R/M. (C) GO enrichment analysis. The p-values
  are represented on the x-axis, while the GO terms are shown on the y-axis, and the
  size of each circle indicates the number of genes. The top 16 enriched GO terms
  are displayed in descending order of significance based on their p-values. The size
  of each circle represents the number of genes associated with the GO term, while
  the color of the circle reflects the p-values. (D) KEGG enrichment analysis. The
  p-values are represented on the x-axis, while the KEGG pathways are shown on the
  y-axis, and the size of each circle indicates the number of genes. The enriched
  KEGG terms are shown in the order of p-values
