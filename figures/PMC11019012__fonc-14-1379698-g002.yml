caption: The mechanisms of the two main pathways of apoptosis. “→” represents promotion;
  “⟂” represents inhibition. (A) The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is regulated by
  the BCL-2 family of proteins and can be initiated by various stimuli. For example,
  BH3-only proteins such as PUMA and NOXA are activated directly through transcriptional
  regulation by P53. These BH3-only proteins activate the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax
  or Bak, inhibiting the anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1. The
  activation of Bax or Bak leads to the initiation of MOMP, which in turn activates
  the cascade, culminating in cell apoptosis. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP),
  a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family that is often overexpressed
  in malignancies, functions to inhibit caspase activation and can be inactivated
  by SMAC. (B) The death receptor pathway is initiated by the activation of caspase-8,
  Fas, TNF, and TNF receptors, which recruit death domain proteins such as FADD and
  TRADD, as well as caspases, to form death-inducing signaling complexes (DISC). Other
  downstream molecules have been activated by DISC and lead to apoptosis.
