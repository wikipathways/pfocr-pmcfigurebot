caption: 'hE2A-PBX1 activate the TNF/IL-17/MAPK signaling pathway through upregulation
  of runx1 expression. (A) Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) of runx1 expressions
  in Tg(hsp70:E2A-PBX1-EGFP) (right panel) were higher than siblings (left panel)
  at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). The caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) is enlarged
  in the red box (original magnification ×200). (A’) Statistical analysis of the runx1+
  signals in panel (A). The black asterisks indicate statistical difference (Student
  t tests, mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]; *P<0.05). N/N: number of zebrafish
  larvae showing representative phenotype/total number of zebrafish larvae examined.
  (B) Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis showed increased
  runx1 mRNA expression in Tg(hsp70:E2A-PBX1-EGFP) compared to the sibling controls
  at 3 dpf. The black asterisks indicate statistical difference (Student t tests,
  mean ± SEM; ****P<0.0001) (C) Decreased number of lyz+ neutrophils in sibling and
  Tg(hsp70:E2APBX1-EGFP) larvae after injecting 0.2 mM runx1 morpholino (MO) at 3
  dpf. The control groups were treated with 0.2 mM random sequence MO. The CHT is
  enlarged in the red box (original magnification ×200). (C’) Statistical analysis
  of the lyz+ signals shown in panel (C). The black asterisks indicate statistical
  difference (N≥15, one-way ANOVA, mean ± SEM; ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001). (D) Top
  20 enriched KEGG pathways identified in the analysis of differentially expressed
  genes (DEG) in KM cells from 6-month-old Tg(hsp70:E2A-PBX1-EGFP) compared to control
  groups after 3-month heat shock. The TNF/IL-17/MAPK signaling pathway is highlighted
  by the red arrow. (E) Heatmap of DEG involved in the TNF/IL-17/MAPK signaling pathway
  between WT and hE2A-PBX1 adult fish. Red and blue represent an increase and decrease
  gene expression levels, respectively; P<0.05. (F) RT-qPCR analysis showing mRNA
  expression of fosab, hsp27, junb, mmp9, socs3b, fosb and fosl1a in Tg(hsp70:E2A-PBX1-EGFP)
  compared to siblings after injecting 0.2 mM runx1 MO at 3 dpf. The control groups
  were treated with 0.2 mM random sequence MO (one-way ANOVA, mean ± SEM; *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001). TNF: tumor necrosis factor; IL-17: interleukin-17; MAPK:
  mitogen-activated protein kinase.'
