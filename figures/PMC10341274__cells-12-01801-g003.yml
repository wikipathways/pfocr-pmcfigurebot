figure_title: Overview of hypothalamic and brainstem control of energy, glucose, and
  lipid homeostasis.
caption: 'Overview of hypothalamic and brainstem control of energy, glucose, and lipid
  homeostasis. Both hypothalamic and brainstem neuronal populations exert prominent
  homeostatic control over energy intake and energy expenditure. Circulating signals
  can also activate/inhibit distinct neural pathways to recalibrate autonomic outflow
  to various metabolic organs and endocrine glands. This crosstalk between the CNS
  and the periphery is essential for the maintenance of glucose and lipid homeostasis.
  It should be noted that the figure highlights only a limited number of metabolically
  relevant pathways due to space restrictions. Please see text for details. AGRP:
  Agouti-related protein; POMC: Pro-opiomelanocortin; NTS: nucleus tractus solitarius;
  DMH: Dorsomedial hypothalamus; PVH: Paraventricular nucleus; DVC: Dorsal vagal complex;
  DMV: Dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus; ARC: Arcuate nucleus; NPY: Neuropeptide
  Y; SF1: Steroidogenic factor 1; NMDA: N-methyl-D-aspartate; GLP1R: Glucagon-like
  peptide-1 receptor; GIT: Gastrointestinal tract. Orange dotted lines/arrows represent
  modulation of hypothalamic neural circuits. Blue dotted lines/arrows represent modulation
  of brainstem neural circuits'
