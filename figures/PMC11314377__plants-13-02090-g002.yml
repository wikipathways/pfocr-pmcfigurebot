  plants subjected to the dark shading treatment.
caption: Differential analysis of glycometabolism in the leaf sheaths of B03S plants
  subjected to the dark shading treatment. (A) Phenotype and leaf sheath of plants
  subjected to deep and shallow transplantation at 4 DAT. (B) Heatmap analysis of
  the main differentially accumulated metabolites of the glycometabolism and energy
  metabolism pathways. The blue asterisk indicates representative metabolites from
  three different branching pathways. The arrow indicates metabolites related to NADPH
  and ATP. (C) The amounts of the main differentially accumulated metabolites in three
  different pathways. (D) The levels of four representative types of metabolites.
  (E) Metabolite content of NADPH and ATP. The energy charge was calculated as (ATP
  + 0.5 × ADP)/(ATP + ADP + AMP). The data are shown as the mean ± standard error
  (n = 3). The black asterisks indicate significant differences according to Student’s
  t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001)
