caption: Effects of heat stress on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathways of largemouth bass (M. salmoides). (a) KEGG pathways identically enriched
  for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the livers of largemouth bass from
  the heat-sensitive (HES) subgroup or heat-tolerant (HET) subgroup. The abscissa
  presents the statistical significance (−Log10-transformed corrected Padj) of the
  KEGG terms following HES and HET treatments. Red and blue represent HES and HET,
  respectively. (b–g) The number of up- and down-regulated DEGs with the most significant
  KEGG terms following HES and HET treatments. ‘Steroid biosynthesis’ (b), ‘Drug metabolism’
  (c), ‘Pyrimidine metabolism’ (d), ‘Cholesterol metabolism’ (e), ‘Complement and
  coagulation cascades’ (f), and ‘Influenza A’ (g) terms. (h) Enrichment analysis
  of KEGG pathways of HET-responsive DEGs involved in environmental information processing.
  The abscissa presents the statistical significance (−Log10-transformed corrected
  Padj) of the KEGG terms. (i–l) The number of up- and down-regulated DEGs involved
  in environmental information processing. ‘ECM-receptor interaction’ (i), ‘Viral
  protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor’ (j), ‘Cytokine–cytokine
  receptor interaction’ (k), and ‘FoxO signaling pathway’ (l) terms
