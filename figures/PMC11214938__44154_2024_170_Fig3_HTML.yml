caption: KEGG analyses of the total DAPs at four time points during infection of Pst
  race CYR23 (A) and CYR31 (B). C The heat map shows the phosphorylation level changes
  of proteins related to the MAPK signaling pathway enriched by total DAPs in incompatible
  and compatible interactions, as well as the plant-pathogen interaction pathway enriched
  at 18â€‰h. D The phosphorylation level changes of resistant -related proteins in incompatible
  and compatible interactions at different time points. Up represents an upregulation
  in phosphorylation level, while Down represents a downregulation in phosphorylation
  level
