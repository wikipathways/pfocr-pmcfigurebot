  signaling pathway via UBC13.
caption: OTUD6A participates in the regulation of NF-κB mediated inflammation signaling
  pathway via UBC13. (a) Macrophages derived from the bone marrow of wild-type and
  Otud6a−/− mice were induced and stimulated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 30 min and 120 min.
  Total proteins were extracted for an immunoblotting experiment to detect the protein
  levels of endogenous p65, p-p65, IκBα, and p-IκBα. (b) FLAG-M2 beads were used to
  enrich proteins in HEK293 cells, re Ubc13 was identified as a potential interaction
  protein for OTUD6A through mass spectrometry. (c) Log2(score) of Flag-vector and
  Flag-OTUD6A MS. Flag-OTUD6A MS specific ubiquitin-relative proteins were highlighted.
  (d) Flag-UBC13 and HA-OTUD6A were simultaneously overexpressed in HEK293 cells.
  After 24 h, the cells were infected with HSV-1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments
  were performed using Flag antibody and IgG antibody after 6 h, respectively. (e)
  The cysteine residue at position 87 of UBC13 was mutated to alanine to obtain the
  Flag-UBC13-C87A mutant plasmid. HA-OTUD6A and Flag-Ubc13 or Flag-UBC13 C87A plasmids
  were overexpressed in HEK293 cells for 24 h, followed by HSV infection. Co-immunoprecipitation
  experiments were performed using Flag antibody and IgG antibody after 6 h, respectively.
  (f) The pattern of UBC13 point mutations and OTUD6A truncation mutations is shown.
  (g) OTUD6A with 50 or 100 amino acids missing from the N-terminal (HA-OTUD6A d1-50,
  HA-OTUD6A d1-100) and full-length OTUD6A (HA-OTUD6A fl) were transfected into HEK293
  cells with UBC13 for 24 h. The cells were then infected with HSV for 6 h before
  co-immunoprecipitation (with anti-FLAG) and immunoblotting analysis using the indicated
  antibodies
