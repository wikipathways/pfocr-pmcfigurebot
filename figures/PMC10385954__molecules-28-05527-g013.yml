figure_title: Putative mechanism of artemisinin neuroprotective action against 6-OHDA
  and MPP+-induced neuronal injury.
caption: Putative mechanism of artemisinin neuroprotective action against 6-OHDA and
  MPP+-induced neuronal injury. Artemisinin stimulated ERK1/2 related signaling pathway
  in neuronal cells and the brain of the PD mice model, resulting in the reduction
  of oxidative stress, correction of mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibition of
  apoptosis
