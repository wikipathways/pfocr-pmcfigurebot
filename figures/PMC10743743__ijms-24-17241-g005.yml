  (A) Relative mRNA expression levels of apoptosis.'
caption: 'Cr(VI) promoted the apoptosis of mitochondrial pathways in the liver: (A)
  Relative mRNA expression levels of apoptosis. (B) Heatmap analysis of apoptosis
  related genes’ mRNA expression levels. (C) Protein bands. (D) Relative protein expression
  levels of apoptosis. (E) Representative images of TUNEL-positive hepatocytes (400×);
  bars = 20 μm; white arrows: positive results. (F) Hepatocyte apoptosis rate analysis.
  With the column data, the same letters on the shoulder mean that the difference
  is not significant (p > 0.05), different small letters mean a significant difference
  (p < 0.05), and different capital letters mean an extremely significant difference
  (p < 0.01)'
