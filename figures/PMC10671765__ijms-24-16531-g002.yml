figure_title: Glucose metabolism and insulin pathway signaling activated by PD-MSCs
  through the AMPK signaling pathway.
caption: 'Glucose metabolism and insulin pathway signaling activated by PD-MSCs through
  the AMPK signaling pathway. Glucose metabolism and insulin pathway signaling are
  activated by PD-MSCs through the AMPK signaling pathway. (A) The localization of
  GLUT4 in mature follicles (e.g., antral follicles) of ovarian tissues was analyzed
  via immunohistochemistry staining. Scale bar: 100 μm; magnification: 40X. (B) The
  relative DAB intensity was analyzed by 3D Histech. (C) The localization of IGFBP2
  in ovarian tissue was analyzed using immunofluorescence. Scale bar: 50 μm; magnification:
  20X. (D) IGFBP2 gene expression was analyzed using the ImageJ program. The mRNA
  expression of IRS1 (E) and IR (F) was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Western blotting (G)
  and protein expression of AMPK (H), SIRT1 (I), GLUT4 (J), IGFBP2 (K), FOXO3a (L),
  PI3K (M), AKT (N), and IR (O) were quantified. (P) The concentration of ATP production
  was determined in serum via ELISA. (Q) The ratio of mitochondrial DNA in the gDNA
  of ovarian tissues was analyzed via qRT-PCR. GC: granulosa cell; TC: theca cell.
  The data represent the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using
  a one-way ANOVA. Note: * p < 0.05, Nor vs. NTx; * p < 0.05, NTx vs. Tx'
