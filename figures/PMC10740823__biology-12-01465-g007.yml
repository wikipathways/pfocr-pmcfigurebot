caption: Sja-let-7 regulates LF through TGF-β/Smad pathway. (A) Detection of TGF-β,
  Smad2, Smad3, and Smad7 relative expression in the liver. (B) Liver IHC analysis
  and positive area calculation of TGF-β. Scale bar, 200 μm. Insets show a higher
  magnification of the outlined area. Scale bar, 50 μm. (C) Liver IHC analysis and
  positive area calculation of p-smad2/3. Scale bar, 200 μm. Insets show a higher
  magnification of the outlined area. Scale bar, 50 μm. Each individual is represented
  by one dot. All graph data are expressed as the mean ± SD of at least three biological
  replicates per group. Data were statistically analyzed with Student’s t-tests.*
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ns, not significant
