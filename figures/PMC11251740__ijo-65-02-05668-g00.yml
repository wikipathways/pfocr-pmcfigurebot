caption: Clinically relevant dysregulated pathways in GBM. EGFR, PDGFRA and MET are
  some of the most common RTK receptors mutated and/or amplified in GBM. These mutations
  and/or amplifications alter downstream signaling pathways responsible for tumor
  growth and survival. GBMs with these receptor modifications can activate the RAS
  signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and survival while retaining mutations
  in the inhibitory protein of RAS, NF1. PI3K signaling is also upregulated by these
  receptor alterations, while also harboring alterations in the signaling pathway
  itself. In its wild-type form, PTEN inhibits conversion of PIP2 to PIP3. When mutated,
  it activates a downstream cascade of signaling pathways. Increase in Akt activity
  inhibits FOXO, assisting in uncontrolled cell proliferation. While Mouse Double
  Minute 2 (MDM2) has an increase in activity due to the increase in Akt activity,
  MDM2 is also amplified in ~14% of GBMs. MDM2 is typically inhibited by CDKN2A in
  response to activated oncogenic genes/signals, but CDKN2A is mutated in ~50% of
  GBMs. MDM2 inhibits p53 while the p53 gene itself is identified to have mutations
  in ~28% of GBMs. The inhibition of p53 due to mutations and/or increased activity
  of MDM2 prevents p53 from sending cells into apoptosis, leading to tumor growth
  and survival. The protein mTOR is also activated by Akt which promotes the cell
  cycle, leading to phosphorylation of Rb, which allows activation of E2F, thus promoting
  cell proliferation. The Rb signaling pathway is also known to be altered in almost
  80% of GBMs. The image was created using BioRender.com. GBM, glioblastoma; RTK,
