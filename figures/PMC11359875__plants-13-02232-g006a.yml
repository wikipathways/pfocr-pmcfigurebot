caption: (a) Differential abundance (DA) of DMs treated by UV-B. (b) Differential
  abundance (DA) of DMs treated by ABA. The horizontal coordinates represent the differential
  abundance scores, which were calculated as the ratio of the difference between upregulated
  and downregulated metabolites involved in the pathway to the number of all metabolites
  involved in the pathway. The length of the line segments represents the absolute
  value of the DA score, the size of the dot at the end of the line segments represents
  the number of differential metabolites in the pathway, and the color of the line
  segments and dots reflects the p-value size (the closer it is to red, the smaller
  the p-value, and the closer it is to purple, the larger the p-value). Graphing by
