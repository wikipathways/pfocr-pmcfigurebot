figure_title: KLF3 regulates the expression of genes involved in the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway.
caption: 'KLF3 regulates the expression of genes involved in the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway. (A). The HT22-TR/TO-Klf13-cell line was treated with vehicle or doxycycline
  (dox; 1 μg/mL) to force the expression of Klf13 transgene. We harvested cells at
  indicated times after dox treatment, isolated RNA, and conducted RT-qPCR. Forced
  induction of KLF13 caused time-dependent gene repression of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and
  Socs1, while Stat5b expression was induced 2 h after dox treatment, peaked at 4
  h, and then returned to baseline after 8 h of Klf13 induction (Jak1: F(5,17) = 6.967,
  p = 0.001; Jak2: F(5,17) = 13.50, p < 0.0001; Jak3: F(5,17) = 10.03, p = 0.0001;
  Socs1: F(5,17) = 5.106, p = 0.0049; and Stat5b: F(5,18) = 4.588, p = 0.0071; one
  way ANOVA. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences with p < 0.05
  in Dunnett’s post hoc test comparing the mean of treatments with the control). Points
  represent the mean ± SEM (n = 4/time point). There was no statistically significant
  difference in the expression of Stat3, Stat5a, and Socs3 upon treatment with dox.
  (B). The mRNA levels of Jak1, Stat3, Socs1, Socs3, and Igf1 were increased, while
  Stat5b decreased in HT22-Klf13-KO cells compared with the parent cell line (Jak1,
  p = 0.0055; Stat3, p = 0.0052; Stat5a, p = 0.0167; Socs1, p = 0.0116; Socs3, p =
  0.0006; and Igf1, p = 0.0002; Student’s t-test. Asterisks indicate statistically
  significant differences with p < 0.05). Bars represent the mean ± SEM (n = 4/genotype).
  The mRNAs of Ghr, Jak2, Jak3, and Stat5b were unaffected by the loss of Klf13. (C).
  The STAT3 protein content was higher in HT22-Klf13-KO cells compared with the parental
  line, while STAT5 protein levels remained unchanged (STAT3, p = 0.048; Student’s
  t-test. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences with p < 0.05).
  Bars represent the mean ± SEM (n = 4/genotype)'
