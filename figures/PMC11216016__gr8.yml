caption: 'Nano-S@bFGF promote macrophages M2 polarization and co-activate FGFR/Hippo
  pathway in diabetic wounds. (A) Immunohistochemistry of CD86 (M1 marker) and CD163,
  CD206, iNOS1, AGR1 and TNF-a (M2 marker) of the wound tissue (scale bar: 60 μm).
  (B) Immunofluorescence of CD86 and CD163 of the wound tissue (scale bar: 50 μm).
  (C) Immunofluorescence of Yap and p-FGFR of the wound tissue (scale bar: 200 μm).'
