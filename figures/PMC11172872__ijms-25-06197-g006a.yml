caption: 'Effect of UME administration on the Akt/mTOR and FoxO3a signaling pathway
  in the gastrocnemius muscle of dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophic mice was examined.
  The protein expressions of (A) phospho-Akt and Akt, (C) phospho-mTOR and mTOR, and
  (E) phospho-FoxO3a and FoxO3a were analyzed using Western blot analysis. (B,D,F)
  Quantitative analysis of the Western blot results was conducted. Each protein expression
  level was normalized to that of β-actin and expressed relative to the NC group.
  The data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 10). ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 indicate
  significant differences compared to the NC group. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p
  < 0.001 indicate significant differences compared to the MAC group'
