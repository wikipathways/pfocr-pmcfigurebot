caption: Multi-omics data of metabolite compositions and metabolic pathways in T cells
  after ConA administration. (A) Schematic diagram of the workflow for the analysis
  of the proteome and metabolome. Hepatic T cells from WT mice and P2RY12-/- mice
  were induced by ConA. (B) GO enrichment analysis and (C) KEGG enrichment analysis
  are used to classify the significant differentially expressed proteins in hepatic
  T cells between WT+ConA mice and P2RY12-/-+ConA mice. (D) Heat map analysis of metabolite
  compositions in hepatic T cells between WT and P2RY12-/- mice induced by ConA. (E,
  F) Quantitation of the levels of adenosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, citric acid,
  oyruvic acid, oleamide, D-sphingosine in hepatic T cells between WT+ConA mice and
  P2RY12-/-+ConA mice. P<0.05, fc>1.5 as the significant differentially expressed
  metabolites. (G) The metabolic pathways identified using Metabo Analyst 3.0 software
  in hepatic T cells between WT and P2RY12-/- mice induced by ConA. (two-tailed Student's
  t-test)
