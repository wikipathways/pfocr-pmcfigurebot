figure_title: Adiponectin receptor signaling regulates lipid metabolism through PPAR
  nuclear hormone receptors.
caption: Adiponectin receptor signaling regulates lipid metabolism through PPAR nuclear
  hormone receptors. The adiponectin receptor AdipoR2 senses membrane rigidification
  and converts ceramide (Cer) to sphingosine (Sph) via its intrinsic ceramidase activity.
  Sphingosine is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases (Sphks) to generate sphingosine
  1-phosphate (S1P), which acts as a signaling molecule and induces PPARγ. PPARγ transcriptionally
  activates stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs) to increase fatty acid desaturation and
  membrane fluidity. In addition, AdipoR2 can promote PPARα function to enhance fatty
  acid (FA) catabolism. Upon treatment with saturated fatty acids, AdipoR2 affects
  the expression of enzymes involved in acyl chain remodeling, UFA synthesis and cholesterol
  biosynthesis. However, it is not known yet whether these processes are regulated
  indirectly or by signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators downstream of
  AdipoR2. P, phosphate; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α; PPARγ,
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; SREBP1, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein-1; TF, transcription factor; UFA, unsaturated fatty acid
