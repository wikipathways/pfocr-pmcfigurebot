figure_title: CSw reduce body fat content in C.
caption: CSw reduce body fat content in C. elegans by NHR-49. (A) mRNA levels of genes
  related to insulin signalling (IIS) pathway; (B) mRNA levels of genes related to
  SBP-1/MDT-15 signalling pathway; (C) mRNA levels of genes related to TOR and hexosamine
  signalling pathway; (D) mRNA levels of genes related to NHR-49 signalling pathway;
  (E) expression of acs-2 in nhr-49 mutants after CSw treatment; (F,G) transgenic
  representative pictures and quantitative fluorescence intensity of acs-2::GFP in
  C. elegans. Different letters (a, b, c) represent significant (p < 0.05) differences
  among different groups; the same letters indicate no significant differences between
  the two groups. The same subscript number (a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4) indicates
  that the significant differences analysis is performed within the same group
