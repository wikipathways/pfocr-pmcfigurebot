caption: Correlation analysis between transcriptome and metabolome in WR vs. RR. (A)
  The genes correlation and components between WR and RR are shown by the nine-quadrant
  diagram. The abscissa represents the log2FC of the genes, and the ordinate represents
  the log2FC of the metabolites. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs (blue column)
  and DAMs (red column) enriched in the same pathway. The red color represent the
  metabolites and the blue color represent the genes
