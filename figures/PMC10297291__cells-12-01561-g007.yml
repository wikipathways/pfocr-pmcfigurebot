figure_title: Inhibitor of the ATM pathway decreases γH2AX induction by chrysin.
caption: 'Inhibitor of the ATM pathway decreases γH2AX induction by chrysin. Melanic
  SK-ML-28 and MelC cells were pretreated for 6 h in the presence or absence of an
  ATM-specific inhibitor (ATMi, 10 µM), and then cells were treated or not with 40
  (CH40) and 80 µM (CH80) of chrysin. At the end of treatments, cells were labeled
  with an antibody directed against γH2AX by using flow cytometry (A), and the percentages
  of positive cells were analyzed and quantified (B). Significant differences between
  treatments were determined by ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. n.s.: Not
  significant; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001 (comparison to the control); #### p
  < 0.0001'
