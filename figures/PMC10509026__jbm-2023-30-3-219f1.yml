caption: Schematic view of vitamin D (VD) signaling pathway mediated VD receptor (VDR).
  Active form of VD is biosynthesized from precursors taken from diet as well as endogenously
  generated cholesterol metabolites, and catabolized by P450 enzymes depicted in the
  figure. The key conversion into the active form of VD is conducted by cytochrome
  P450 (CYP)27B1, and the major catabolizing enzyme is CYP24A1. Active form of VD
  exerts biological action through gene regulation operated by VDR. Genetic mutations
  deficient of CYP27B1 and VDR function are causal hereditary rickets, similar to
  rachitic abnormality seen in rickets by nutritious deficiency of VD. Organs related
  with VD action are illustrated. UVB, ultraviolet B; 25(OH)D3, 25-hydroxy-vitamin
  D3; FGF23, fibroblast growth factor 23; PTH, parathyroid hormone; VDDR, vitamin
  D-dependent rickets; RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDR, vitamin D receptor; VDRE, vitamin
  D response element
