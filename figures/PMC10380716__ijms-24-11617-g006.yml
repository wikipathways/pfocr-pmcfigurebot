figure_title: Characterization of single-cell RNA-seq data from human injured kidney
  samples.
caption: 'Characterization of single-cell RNA-seq data from human injured kidney samples.
  (A) UMAP plots showing human injured kidney samples without rejection. (B) Dot plot
  showing the gene expression patterns of cluster-enriched typical markers. The color
  of the dots represents the average expression, and the size of the dots represents
  the average percent of cells expressing the selected gene. (C) UMAP plots show the
  failed repair PT gene signature expression in the human injured kidney samples.
  Arrowheads: failed repair PT gene is highly expressed. (D) UMAP rendering of signaling
  pathways. Note that genes for IL-17 pathway signaling were highly expressed in the
  failed repair PT group. The plots that scored highly in the failed repair PT gene
  signatures are circled. The arrows show the location of failed repair PT cells in
  UMAP'
