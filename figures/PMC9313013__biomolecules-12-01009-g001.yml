caption: The three steps of the mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster assembly machinery
  required to mature mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] target proteins. In the first step, a
  [2Fe-2S] cluster is assembled de novo on the scaffold protein ISCU2. The biosynthesis
  involves six additional ISC proteins including the cysteine desulfurase complex
  NFS1-ISD11-ACP1 as a sulfur donor, frataxin (FXN), and the electron (e−) transfer
  chain from NADPH via ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) to ferredoxin FDX2. Only one half
  of the symmetric core ISC complex is depicted. In the second step, a dedicated chaperone
  system (HSPA9, HSC20, and GRPLE1/2) facilitates the transfer of the [2Fe-2S] cluster
  from the ISCU2 scaffold to the monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5, which binds the cluster
  in glutathione (GS)-dependent fashion. A secondary route (indicated by dashed arrows)
  involves BOLA3, which forms an apo complex with GLRX5 able to receive a [2Fe-2S]
  cluster from ISCU2 to form the homodimeric [2Fe-2S] GLRX5 complex; or, alternatively,
  the latter complex can be formed via the interaction of BOLA3 with the homodimeric
  [2Fe-2S] GLRX5 complex. The third step involves [4Fe-4S] cluster synthesis and apoprotein
  insertion. GLRX5 delivers its [2Fe-2S] cluster to three late-acting ISC proteins
  (ISCA1, ISCA2, and IBA57) for [4Fe-4S] cluster biosynthesis, which additionally
  requires the ferredoxin FDX2 electron transfer chain. Subsequently, the newly formed
  [4Fe-4S] cluster is delivered to recipient apoproteins by dedicated Fe-S-targeting
  proteins (e.g., NFU1, IND1 directly binding the [4Fe-4S] cluster) via parallel pathways.
  The major role of BOLA3 protein is in lipoyl synthase (LIAS) maturation. BOLA3 might
  be involved in such function via an alternative pathway, which consists on the [2Fe-2S]
  cluster donation from [2Fe-2S] GLRX5-BOLA3 complex to apo NFU1 to assemble a [4Fe-4S]
  cluster on NFU1 thanks to the delivery of two electrons, whose physiological source
  needs, however, to be identified.
