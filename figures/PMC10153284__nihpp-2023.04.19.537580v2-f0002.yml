caption: (a-b) Naïve CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were analyzed for
  mitochondrial function. (a) Measurements of Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) levels
  after sequential addition of Oligomycin, FCCP and Rotenone/Antimycin A (top right);
  average OCR values at Spare Respiratory Capacity (bottom right, SRC; see methods)
  are shown. (b) Mitotracker Green (Mito Green) and TMRE; representative histograms
  are shown above, while average gMFI values are shown below. (c-d) CD4-Cre or CD4-Cre
  Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) for up to
  72h. (c) Mito Green and TMRE average gMFI levels at 3h (above) and 72h (below) after
  activation are shown. (d) Measurements of Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR)
  levels after addition of Oligomycin (top left); measurements of Oxygen Consumption
  Rate (OCR) levels after sequential addition of Oligomycin, FCCP and Rotenone/Antimycin
  A (top right); average ECAR values at baseline (bottom left), average OCR values
  at baseline (bottom middle) and Spare Respiratory Capacity (bottom right, SRC; see
  methods) are shown. (e) Heatmap showing expression of genes from the Glycolysis
  pathway in 72h-activated CD8+ T cells; expression in memory-like CD8+ T cells (with
  additional IL-15 treatment – more on Figure 6) are shown in comparison. (f-h) CD4-Cre
  or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2)
  for 72h, then further polarized into effector-like cells with IL-2 for additional
  72h. (f) Experimental design. (g) Measurements of Extracellular Acidification Rate
  (ECAR) levels from effector-like CD8+ T cells after sequential addition of Glucose,
  Oligomycin and 2-DG (top left); in the top right, kinetics of OCR values. On the
  bottom, average baseline ECAR and OCR values, and the ratios between ECAR and OCR
  values from effector-like CD8+ T cells are shown respectively. (h) Average Mito
  Green and TMRE gMFI values for effector-like CD8+ T cells. (i) CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre
  Panx1fl/fl P14 cells were transferred into C57BL/6 mice infected with LCMV-Arm.
  At day 7 post-infection, TE P14 cells were sorted. ECAR and OCR kinetics (top),
  ECAR values (bottom left), OCR values (bottom center) and ECAR/OCR ratios (bottom
  right) from sorted TE gp33+ CD8+ T cells are shown. (a-d, f-i) Data from 2–3 independent
  experiments, n=4–21 per experimental group. (e) Data from 2–3 biological replicates
  per experimental group (from n=5–8 mice per group). ns – not significant (p>0.05),
  *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001, Unpaired t-test (a-d, f-i)
