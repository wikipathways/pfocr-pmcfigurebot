caption: Rspo3 is upregulated in GE sheep. (A) Expression of four Rspos in skin tissues
  of GE and WT groups. (B) The mRNA levels of LRP5, LRP6, Axin2, and LEF1 in the skin
  tissue. (C) Expression of Wnt signaling pathway antagonists was observed using qRT-PCR.
  Among the 10 Wnt-related genes, eight genes were increased (Rspo1, Rspo2, Rspo3,
  Rspo4, LRP6, LRP5, Axin2, and LEF1) and two genes (Notum and DKK2) were decreased.
