caption: The regulatory mechanisms upstream and downstream of CYP51A1. (A-H) Significant
  difference in volumes and wet weights of tumor xenografts under different groups.
  (I) Western blotting analysis of NF-κB signaling pathway of CYP51A1. (J) The binding
  site was predicted in bold sequences using matinspector software (Genomatix, Munich,
  Germany). (K) The binding site was amplified by the same specific primers using
  PCR in the ChIP assay. (L) The quantitative data of CHIP assay. (M) Western blotting
  analysis of CYP51A1 in 5 pairs of renal cancer tumor samples and adjacent normal
  samples. The data are analyzed by Student's t-test (two-tailed) and presented as
  mean ± SD. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001
