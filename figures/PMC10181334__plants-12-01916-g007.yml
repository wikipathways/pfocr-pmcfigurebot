caption: 'Enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways in L. chinensis under salt and
  alkali stress. (A) CK−MS; (B) CK−SS; (C) CK−MA; (D) CK−SA. Each circle in the figure
  represents a metabolic pathway. Circle color from shallow to deep represents p-values
  from large to small, and circle radius from small to large represents impact value
  from small to large. The deeper the circle color and the greater the radius, the
  greater the impact of stress on this pathway. The circle closer to the upper right
  corner of the pathway diagram represents the more significant effect of stress on
  this pathway. (1) Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; (2) glycine, serine,
  and threonine metabolism; (3) glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; (4) TCA cycle;
  (5) butanoate metabolism; (6) alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; (7)
  TCA cycle; (8) glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; and (9) C5-branched dibasic
  acid metabolism. CK: control group; MS: 200 mmol/L NaCl treatment; SS: 400 mmol/L
  NaCl treatment; MA: 25 mmol/L Na2CO3 treatment; SA: 50 mmol/L Na2CO3 treatment'
