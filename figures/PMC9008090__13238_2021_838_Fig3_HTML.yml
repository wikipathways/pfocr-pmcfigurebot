figure_title: Potential mechanisms underlying perfect repair and imperfect repair
  via the SSTR pathway
caption: DSB site, generated by CRISPR-Cas nuclease, undergoes end resection and generates
  3′ overhangs. In the presence of ssDNA donor, the 3′ overhang anneals with the ssDNA
  donor and primes DNA synthesis, leading to complete or incomplete 1st strand synthesis.
  Complete 1st strand synthesis copies both the 3′-end edit (red line) and 5′-end
  edit (blue line). However, incomplete 1st strand synthesis only copies the 3′-end
  edit (red line). After 1st strand synthesis, the ssDNA donor is removed (or not
  removed) by helicase. The newly synthesized 1st strand anneals with homology sequences
  at the other end of the DSB site. If the ssDNA donor is removed, the DSB is repaired
  by gap filling and ligation. If the ssDNA donor is not removed, the annealing process
  generates a repair intermediate with a 5′ flap, which will be further repaired by
  flap excision, gap filling, and ligation, resulting in the retention of ssDNA donor
  at the target site. Whether SSTR results in the retention of ssDNA donor at the
  target site is still under debate. During incomplete 1st strand synthesis, the newly
  synthesized 1st strand searches the DSB site for microhomology sequences for hybridization,
  resulting in an imperfect repair without a 5′-end edit. The direction of the arrow
  represents the 5′ to 3′ direction. 3′-end edit, red line. 5′-end edit, blue line.
