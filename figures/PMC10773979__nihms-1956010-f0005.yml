figure_title: 1,25(OH)2D3 activates the PKA pathway in airway epithelial cells
caption: (A) 16HBE cells were treated with 1 μM 1,25(OH)2D3 for the indicated time
  and fixed by 4 % PFA. Cells were then immunolabeled with antibodies against pCREB(S133)
  and imaged with confocal microscopy (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).
  Scale bar, 30 μm. (B) The integrated fluorescence intensities of pCREB(S133) in
  A were analyzed and plotted as fold over that of vehicle group at 0 min. Data shown
  as mean ± S.E.M., n = 9 images from three independent experiments, two-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. (C) Representative Western blot of
  whole-cell lysates from 16HBE cells treated with 1 μM 1,25(OH)2D3 for the indicated
  time. GAPDH served as the control for protein loading. (D) Densitometric analysis
  of blots in C. The protein level of pCREB(S133) was determined by densitometric
  analysis and plotted as normalized values as indicated. Data shown as mean ± S.E.M.,
  n = 3, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons versus 0 min *p
  < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001; ns, not significant
