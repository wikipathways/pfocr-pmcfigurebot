figure_title: Effect of phosphite (Phi) on STOP1 and PHR1/PHL1 targets.
caption: 'Effect of phosphite (Phi) on STOP1 and PHR1/PHL1 targets. (a) Raincloud
  plot and heatmap of the STOP1 targets. (b) Raincloud plot and heatmap of the PHR1/PHL1
  targets. (c) Changes in gene expression of STOP1 signaling pathway related genes.
  (d) Changes in gene expression of PHR1 signaling pathway related genes. Question
  marks in (c,d) represent putative or still unknown regulatory components of the
  pathway. (e) Venn diagram of the genes related to PHR1/PHL1, STOP1, Systemic PSR,
  and local PSRs, including genes that are not part of these sets. For (a,b): Tukey´s
  multiple comparisons of means test were performed between treatments; different
  letters mean significant differences between treatments. In (c,d): blue triangles
  represent downregulated genes and red triangles represent upregulated genes, n.s.
  stands for non-significant. Likelihood ratio tests according to the edgeR pipeline
  were performed on each pair of genes to determine if there are significant differences
  between treatments'
