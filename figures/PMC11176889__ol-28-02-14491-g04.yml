  pathway.
caption: ZBTB20 increases the activity of FAS/CASP3 signaling through the TET1 pathway.
  Expression of FAS in ZBTB20-overexpressing U251 cells was detected using (A) reverse
  transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and (B) western blotting. (C)
  Histogram of the western blotting analysis of ZBTB20-overexpressing U251 cells.
  (D) Expression of key genes in the FAS/CASP3 signaling pathway in ZBTB20-overexpressing
  U251 cells treated with 30 µM Bobcat339 for 24 h were detected by western blotting,
  which was semi-quantified and presented as histograms for (E) FAS and (F) cleaved
  CASP3/CASP3. All experiments were independent experiments and were repeated three
  times. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
