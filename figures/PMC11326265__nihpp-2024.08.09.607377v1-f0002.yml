  (A-B) Pathway enrichment analysis (Elsevier Pathway Collection) of significantly up-regulated genes (A) (FDR < 0.05, Log2FC > 0) and significantly down-regulated genes (B) (FDR < 0.05, Log2FC < 0) in miR-1 KO/WT from gastrocnemius bulk RNA-seq (n=4 female WT, n=4 female miR-1 KO, post-vehicle or tamoxifen treatment and an 8-week washout). Top 9 pathways (by adj. p-value) shown. (C) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes, dashed lines indicate p-value, FDR, and FC cutoffs. Yellow represents significantly up-regulated genes, and blue represents significantly down-regulated genes. P-value cutoff set at 1e-25 for visibility. Genes in pathways from (A-B) labeled on the volcano plot. (D) Cumulative density function (CDF) of eCLIP-seq-defined miR-1 targets (blue) and miR-133 (green) Log2FC from RNA-seq compared to non-miR-1 targets (yellow). (E)
  Ptbp1 mRNA expression in WT and miR-1 KO gastrocnemius. (F) Representative Western blot of PKM1 and PKM2 and corresponding total protein levels in WT and miR-1 KO gastrocnemius muscle lysates. (G-I) Quantification of (G) PKM1 protein levels, (H) PKM2 protein levels, and (I) the ratio of PKM2 to PKM1. For Western blotting and qPCR experiments, n=8–10 WT and n=8–10 miR-1 KO females (post-tamoxifen treatment and an 8-week washout) were used, and differences between WT and miR-1 KO were tested using an independent t-test. ****p < 0.0001, ns: not significant
