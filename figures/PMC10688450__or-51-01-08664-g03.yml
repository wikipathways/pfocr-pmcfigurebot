caption: Link between U2AF1 and NF-κB signalling in MDS and AML. The isoform IRAK4
  encodes the proteins IRAK4L and MyD88, which activate the NF-κB signalling pathway.
  In MDS/AML, a mutant U2AF1 splicing factor mediates the expression of IRAK4, and
  the inactivation of IRAK4 suppresses leukaemia cell proliferation. Moreover, mutations
  in the splicing genes SF3B1 and SRSF2 lead to aberrant regulation of MAP3K7 and
  CASP8, affecting NF-κB signalling expression. U2AF1, U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary
  factor 1; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome; AML, acute myeloid leukaemia
