caption: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays a bi-directional regulatory role
  in differentiating macrophages into osteoclasts. Nuclear Factor-κB Ligand (RANKL)/Notch1
  is a crucial signal pathway for inducing macrophages to differentiate into osteoclasts.
  Hypoxia upregulates HIF-1α, inhibiting autophagosomes formation in macrophages,
  promoting the expression of RANKL by activating the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/Signal
  Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in osteoblast. In
  addition, HIF-1α also activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/caspase-3 pathway
  in osteocytes and stimulates the RANKL/Notch1 signal pathway. However, miR-34a-5p
  inhibits RANKL/Notch1 signal pathway under HIF-1α/interleukin 33 (IL-33) stimulation.
