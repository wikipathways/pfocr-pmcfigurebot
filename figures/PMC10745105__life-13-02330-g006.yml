figure_title: Working model of GAH-dependent vascular repair.
caption: Working model of GAH-dependent vascular repair. In zebrafish, GAH activates
  BMP signaling transduction through non-Smad pathways to stimulate VEGF signaling
  or to activate the transcriptional levels of VEGF members via Smad1/5/9, which in
  turn promotes vascular development and impairment repair

  through BMP Signaling to Promote Zebrafish Vascular Development and Impairment Repair
