figure_title: Signaling pathways in psoriasis pathogenesis in keratinocytes.
caption: Signaling pathways in psoriasis pathogenesis in keratinocytes. This diagram
  illustrates the intricate network of cytokine signaling pathways that are activated
  within keratinocytes by key proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-22, IFN-γ,
  and TNF-α, which are secreted by various immune cells. The complex interplay of
  cytokines, signaling cascades, and transcriptional regulators promotes the hyperproliferation,
  aberrant differentiation, and chronic inflammation observed in psoriatic keratinocytes.
  IFN-γ binding to its receptor activates the Janus kinase 1/2-signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 1 (JAK1/2-STAT1) signaling. Phosphorylated STAT1 induces
  the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, and CXCL11. Similarly,
  TNF-α binding to the TNF receptor (TNFR) activates complex I, which comprises TNF
  receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2),
  receptor-interacting protein, and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs).
  In turn, these activate the TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs), activator protein 1 (AP1), I-kappa-B kinase (IKK), inhibitor
  of kappa B (IκB), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. The translocation
  of AP1 induces S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8), human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2),
  hBD-3, and S100A7 expression, whereas NF-κB activation induces C-C motif chemokine
  ligand 20 (CCL20), keratin 17 (KRT17), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2),
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) expression.
  Additionally, IL-17A activates the MAPK, NF-κB, and STAT3 pathways by binding to
  the IL-17 receptor A/IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RA/IL-17RC) heterodimer. The IL-22 receptor
  1/IL-10 receptor 2 (IL-22R1/IL-10R2) heterodimer activates STAT3 by phosphorylating
  tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and JAK1 and inducing CCL20 and KRT17 expression. Additionally,
  IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) inhibits IL-22 activity by directly binding to it.
