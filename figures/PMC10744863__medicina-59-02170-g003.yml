figure_title: Protein pathway analysis in acquired aplastic anemia (AA).
caption: Protein pathway analysis in acquired aplastic anemia (AA). Proteins from
  an aptamer-based high-throughput proteomic analysis [28] were extracted, and those
  whose levels changed >1.5 fold change after immunosuppressive therapies in complete
  (CR), partial (PR), and non-responders (NRs) were interpolated. (A) Proteins that
  showed >1.5 fold changes (n = 11) and (B) that did not change after treatment in
  PR and NR (n = 11) nor in NR only (n = 15). (C) Those 11 proteins were used for
  protein pathway analysis by STRING database, and the first top 15 represented networks
  are reported, as well as (D) those networks enriched using those 15 unmodified proteins
  in NR only
