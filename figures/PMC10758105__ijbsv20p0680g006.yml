figure_title: FNDC5 deficiency disrupted intracellular calcium homeostasis and induced
  ER stress in aortic tissues of AngII-treated hypertensive mice.
caption: FNDC5 deficiency disrupted intracellular calcium homeostasis and induced
  ER stress in aortic tissues of AngII-treated hypertensive mice. A. Venn diagram
  showed the number of uniquely expressed genes in aortic tissues of WT and KO mice
  with Ang II treatment. B. The volcano map visualized the distribution of differential
  genes (including up-regulation and down-regulation) in the aortic tissues of WT
  and KO mice treated with Ang II (490 ng/min/kg) for 4 weeks. C. RNA-seq GO enrichment
  analyses of gene expression (top 30) in aortic tissues of WT and KO mice after Ang
  II (490 ng/min/kg) exposure for 4 weeks. D. RNA-seq heat map compared the top 30
  clustering features of GO enrichment in aortic tissues of WT and KO mice after Ang
  II (490 ng/min/kg) exposure for 4 weeks. Each column represents an individual mouse.
  E. The heat map of calcium signaling pathway from GO enrichment in aortic tissues
  of WT and KO mice after Ang II (490 ng/min/kg) exposure for 4 weeks. F. RNA-seq
  KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of gene expression in aortic tissues of WT and
  KO mice challenged with Ang II (490 ng/min/kg) for 4 weeks. G. The heat map of calcium
  signaling pathway from KEGG pathway enrichment in aortic tissues of WT and KO mice
  challenged with Ang II (490 ng/min/kg) for 4 weeks. H. The heat map of expression
  of ER stress-related genes in aortic tissues of WT and KO mice after Ang II (490
  ng/min/kg) exposure for 4 weeks
