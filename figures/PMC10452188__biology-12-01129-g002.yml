caption: Correlation of 41 metabolic pathways from three primary categories and cancer
  survival. (A) A total of 84 metabolic pathways from 11 major metabolite-related
  subtypes defined by KEGG were used. (B) Heatmap of the regression coefficients of
  the Cox regression model of the three main metabolite-related pathways. A coefficient
  greater than 0 indicates that the metabolic pathway increases the risk of patient
  death, while a coefficient less than 0 indicates that the metabolic pathway decreases
  the risk of patient death. * indicates a significant association between the metabolic
  pathway and cancer prognosis. (C) Bar chart showing the total number of metabolic
  pathways significantly associated with a specific number of cancer prognoses in
  the three main metabolite-related pathways. The height of the bar represents the
  total number of metabolic pathways significantly associated with a specific number
  of cancer prognoses. (D) Statistics of the number of major metabolite-related metabolic
  pathways significantly associated with cancer prognosis in each cancer type
