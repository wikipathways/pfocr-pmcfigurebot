caption: Gene set enrichment analysis between aGVHD patients and non-aGVHD group.
  (a) All the activated and suppressed signaling pathways in T cells from aGVHD patients
  compared with non-aGVHD group. Pathway signatures source from hallmark gene sets.
  Count represents the number of “core genes” which are high-expressed in activated
  pathways or low-expressed in suppressed pathways, having significant contribution
  to the pathway status. GeneRatio is the ratio of Count to the total number of genes
  in the pathways contained in the dataset. (b) P53 pathway remarkably downregulated
  in T cells from aGVHD patients.
