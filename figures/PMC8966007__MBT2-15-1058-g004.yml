caption: Involvement of the PTS, DasR and AtrA in the Streptomyces CCR. GlcNAc transport
  occurs via PTS which also phosphorylates it. When GlcNAc is at a high concentration,
  Nag A deacetylates GlcNAc‐6P obtaining GlcN‐6P, which negatively modulates DasR
  activity. Nag B converts GlcN‐6P into Fru‐6P, which can flow in the glycolysis pathway.
  At high glucose concentration DasR negatively affects NagA and NagB activities.
  DasR also represses the genes of morphological differentiation and secondary metabolites
  production (streptomycin, actinorhodin [ACT], undecylprodigiosin [RED], calcium‐dependent
  antibiotic [CDA] and coelimycin [CPK]). On the contrary, AtrA acts as an antagonist
  of DasR since it activates ACT, streptomycin production and GlcNAc transport.
