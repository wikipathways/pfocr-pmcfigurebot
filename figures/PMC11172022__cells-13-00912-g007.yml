figure_title: Chronic HS diet induced a metabolic phenotype switch in TISCs.
caption: Chronic HS diet induced a metabolic phenotype switch in TISCs. The TISCs
  obtained from explanted tumors in each of the four passages in RS and HS dietary
  cohorts were cultured in base DMEM media without glucose and glutamine. pH-sensitive
  measurement of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, A–C) was assessed by time-course
  changes in lactate production following addition of 100 mM glucose (gluc), mitochondrial
  inhibitor oligomycin (oligo, 2.5 μM), and glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy glucose (2DG,
  500 mM). (A) Passage 1 TISCs from RS cohort (Py230-C57Bl/6J) demonstrated increased
  glycolytic activity following treatment with mitochondrial inhibitor (oligo) compared
  to HS diet counterparts, suggesting that TISCs from HS diet cohort were already
  at saturation capacity of glycolysis which could not be further enhanced by oligo
  treatment. (B) Passage 4 TISCs from RS cohort also demonstrated increased glycolytic
  activity following treatment with mitochondrial inhibitor (oligo) compared to HS
  diet counterparts, suggesting that TISCs from HS diet cohort were already at saturation
  capacity of glycolysis which could not be further enhanced by oligo treatment. (C)
  Comparisons in the glycolytic reserve capacity among TISCs from each of the four
  passages demonstrated that RS diet cohort had higher glycolytic reserve compared
  to HS diet cohort, suggesting that glycolysis is the major metabolic pathway in
  TISCs under HS dietary conditions. For measuring oxygen consumption rate (OCR, D–F)
  to determine the mitochondrial metabolism, the TISCs were cultured in base DMEM
  media with 100 mM glucose for basal OCR response, followed by time-course response
  changes with addition of mitochondrial inhibitors (oligo, 2.5 μM), proton gradient
  disruptor (carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone, FCCP, 500 nM)
  and rotenone/antimycin A (Rot/AntiA, 50/100 nM). (D) Passage 1 TISCs from RS cohort
  (Py230-C57Bl/6J) demonstrated increased basal OCR over HS cohort counterparts, suggesting
  that TISCs from RS cohort have oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolic phenotype.
  Following treatment with metabolic inhibitors (oligo, FCCP, Rot/AntiA), TISCs from
  both cohorts demonstrated a similar change in OCR pattern. (E) Passage 4 TISCs from
  RS cohort (Py230-C57Bl/6J) demonstrated increased basal OCR over HS cohort counterpart,
  suggesting that TISCs from RS cohort have oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolic
  phenotype. (F) Comparison of apparent respiratory reserve capacity among both cohorts
  demonstrated that TISCs from HS diet cohort in all four passages have higher OXPHOS
  reserve over their RS counterparts, suggesting that while OXPHOS is the major metabolic
  phenotype in RS cohort, glycolysis is the major metabolic phenotype in HS cohort.
  (G,H) ECAR studies following stimulation with TGFβ demonstrated that HS diet cohort
  maintained glycolytic phenotype. Although we noticed a slight decrease in glycolytic
  reserve capacity in HS+TGFβ cohort (H) versus HS alone (C), this difference did
  not reach statistical significance. Similarly, we observed slight decreases in glycolytic
  reserve between RS+TGFβ (H) vs. RS alone (C), which was also was not statistically
  significant. These data suggested that TGFβ further slightly enhanced the glycolytic
  metabolic phenotype (although statistically insignificant) in TISCs from both RS
  and HS cohorts. (I,J) OCR studies following stimulation with TGFβ demonstrated that
  RS diet cohort maintained OXPHOS phenotype. The respiratory reserve capacity of
  all 4 passages of HS+TGFβ (J) versus HS alone (F) showed statistically significant
  differences, suggesting that TGFβ further reduced the OXPHOS metabolism in chronic
  HS diet, leading to enhanced glycolytic metabolism, which is needed to produce additional
  macromolecules associated with cancerous cell differentiation and proliferation
  in Py230-C57Bl/6J tumor model. (K–N) The glycolytic reserve changes (K) and respiratory
  reserve changes (L); alongside these changes, after TGFβ treatment (M,N), the 4T1-BALB/cJ
  model followed a similar pattern to the Py230-C57Bl/6J model mentioned above. Data
  analyzed by one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons and presented as mean ± SEM;
  n = 6 (biological replicates) per cohort; (*) p-value < 0.05
