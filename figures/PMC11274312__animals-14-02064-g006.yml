figure_title: PPI network of the DEGs in immune-related pathways.
caption: PPI network of the DEGs in immune-related pathways. Red and green represent
  up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs, respectively. Nodes indicate the proteins
  encoded by the corresponding DEGs. The size of the node represents the log2|FC|
  value of the DEG. The higher the value, the larger the node. Edges indicate proteinâ€“protein
  associations predicted by STRING
