caption: 'The PC biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. The de novo and Kennedy pathways are
  represented by the grey and violet lines, respectively. The enzymes of the indicated
  pathways are highlighted with green and light-green ellipses, respectively. Abbreviations:
  Pems—phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase; EK—ethanolamine kinase; CK—choline
  kinase; ECT—phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase; CCT—phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase;
  EPT—ethanolaminephosphotransferase; CPT—cholinephosphotransferase; PMME—phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine;
  PDME—phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine'
