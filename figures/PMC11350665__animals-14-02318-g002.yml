caption: Analysis of oyster transcriptome following a 96-hour exposure to Cd. (a)
  A volcano plot of DEGs is graphically represented with upregulated genes in red
  and downregulated genes in blue. (b) Hierarchical clustering based on the DEGs,
  where red signifies upregulation and blue signifies downregulation. (c) Enrichment
  of DEGs in GO terms categorized into cellular components, biological processes,
  and molecular functions. (d) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs, with colors
  indicating p-value significance and bubble size reflecting the count of enriched
  genes
