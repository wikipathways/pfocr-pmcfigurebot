figure_title: Expression levels of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis DEGs
  in BR-S compared to BR-NS plants.
caption: 'Expression levels of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis DEGs in
  BR-S compared to BR-NS plants. (a) Schematic representation of the biosynthetic
  pathway with proteins encoded by DESeq2 selected genes. Proteins are reported in
  boxes along the arrow connecting the substrate to the enzyme product. Light blue
  boxes indicate proteins encoded by downregulated genes; yellow boxes indicate proteins
  encoded by upregulated genes. (b) RNAseq data validation by quantitative real-time
  PCR (qPCR) of selected DEGs in S vs. NS BR plants. Columns represent log2 of the
  fold-change of gene expression from RNAseq data (log2FC) and values obtained from
  qPCR analysis (log2RQ) calculated as the mean of three biological replicates. The
  NS condition was used as a non-treated reference plant for gene expression normalization.
  Elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1a) was used as the housekeeping gene for target gene
  normalization. Bars on the columns indicate the SE for each gene. No statistically
  significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were observed between the log2FC and log2RQ values
  for each gene when performing a Tukey post hoc ANOVA test. (**) double asterisks
  and (*) single asterisks indicate highly significant and significant differences
  between genes, respectively, for p ≤ 0.05, in a Tukey post hoc ANOVA test. Protein
