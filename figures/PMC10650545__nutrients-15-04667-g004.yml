  altered proton efflux rate (PER) by TCDD in Gr1+ MDSCs.
caption: RSV attenuates a TCDD-induced increase in metabolic process genes and altered
  proton efflux rate (PER) by TCDD in Gr1+ MDSCs. Genes related to Gene Ontology (GO)
  metabolic pathways were assessed. (A) Heatmap showing expression (z-score) of genes
  per group clustered by cladogram in the glycolytic process (GO:0006096) pathway.
  (B,C) Seahorse PER values from TCDD versus RSV+TCDD. Quantification of energetic
  parameters such as pmol/min, including basal glycolysis (conversion of glucose to
  lactate), basal proton efflux rate (the number of protons exported by cells over
  time), and compensatory glycolysis (rate of glycolysis following mitochondrial inhibition
  of oxidative phosphorylation, forcing use of glycolysis to meet energetic demands)
  significantly decreased in RSV+TCDD compared to TCDD (** p  <  0.01) as analyzed
  by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons
