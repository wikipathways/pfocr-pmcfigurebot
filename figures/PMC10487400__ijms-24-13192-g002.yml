figure_title: Glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway.
caption: Glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
  signaling pathway shows a well-timed response to hormone levels, demonstrating that
  the regulation of gene targets by GR requires an ultradian pattern of hormone secretion.
  Cortisol (C) is transported in the blood predominantly bound to corticosteroid-binding
  globulin (CBG). CBG facilitates cortisol circulation and regulates its release to
  tissues. CBG-free cortisol passes passively across the plasma membrane. GRα, in
  the absence of the ligand, is in the cell’s cytoplasm and, after corticosteroid
  binding, is activated and translocated to the nucleus. It operates as a transcription
  factor. GR homodimers bind to DNA, allowing the receptors to regulate gene transcription.
  GRβ is expressed in the nucleus, does not bind corticosteroids, is inactive as a
  transcription factor, and inhibits the transcriptional activity of GRα
