caption: Mechanism of tumoral VISTA facilitation of the proliferation of CML cells
  and suppression of apoptosis. Tumoral VISTA activated the AKT/mTOR and JAK2/STAT5
  pathways and increased the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2. NSC-622608,
  a novel VISTA inhibitor, attenuated the phosphorylation of the AKT/mTOR and JAK2/STAT5
  pathways by inhibiting VISTA activation. This inhibition resulted in reduced proliferation
  of CML cells and induced apoptosis in CML cells
