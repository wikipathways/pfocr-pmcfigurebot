caption: Schematic figure illustrating the signaling pathway activation with mechanical
  ventilation and bleomycin. Bleomycin-induced augmentation of mechanical stretch−mediated
  cytokine production, diaphragm damage, and fibrosis were attenuated in PI3K−γ−deficient
  mice and via pharmacological inhibition with AS605240. BNIP3 = BCL2/adenovirus E1B
  19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3; MDA = malondialdehyde; MuRF−1 = muscle ring
  finger−1; PGC−1α = peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator; PI3K−γ−/−
  = PI3K−γ−deficient mice; ROS = reactive oxygen species; TGF−β1 = transforming growth
  factor−β1; VIDD = ventilator−induced diaphragm dysfunction
