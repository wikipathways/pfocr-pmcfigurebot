caption: Time-course of the global gene expression pattern in lungs of rats repeatedly
  exposed to MWNT-7 for 2 years. A time course of the abundance of DEGs and perturbed
  pathways in the lungs during chronic exposure to MWNT-7 is schematically depicted,
  with examples of genes and pathways. Histological changes in the pulmonary epithelium
  and speculative biological events are also shown at the top
