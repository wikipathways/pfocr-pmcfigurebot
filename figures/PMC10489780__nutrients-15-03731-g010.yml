figure_title: Comparison of qRT-PCR and RNA-seq in model/control group (A), AAPs nutritional
  supplementation/control group (B), and AAPs nutritional supplementation/model group
  (C), and correlation analysis (D).
caption: Comparison of qRT-PCR and RNA-seq in model/control group (A), AAPs nutritional
  supplementation/control group (B), and AAPs nutritional supplementation/model group
  (C), and correlation analysis (D). Comparison of expression levels of key genes
  in MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway between different groups (E). R, correlation coefficient.
  Results are shown as means ± SD (n = 3). Bar charts with the same superscript letters
  indicate that the difference is not significant (p > 0.05), while bar charts with
  different superscript letters indicate that the difference is significant (p < 0.05)
