caption: The proteasomal ubiquitin-independent protein catabolic process is suggested
  as a process pathway induced by ICRP-derived exosomes. Based on proteins overexpressed
  in exosomes (target) relative to proteins present in the ICRP (background), 1–100%
  abundance ratio in a model of Mus musculus (p < 1 × 103 to p < 1 × 105). (a) Shows
  proteasomal ubiquitin-independent protein catabolic as a biological process. (b)
  Shows keratin filament as an outstanding cellular component
