caption: Analysis of KEGG enrichment pathway between treatments compared to CK in
  two ion modes (A–C). The horizontal coordinate is the ratio of the number of differentiated
  metabolites in the corresponding metabolic pathway to the total number of identified
  metabolites in the pathway, and the vertical coordinate represents the difference
  in significance level (−log10(p-value)). The size of the dots represents the number
  of differentiated metabolites in the corresponding pathway. Application of SCZFN
  (T1), application of Bacillus subtilis wettable powder (T2), application of fungicide
  Apron Advance (T3), and application of water (CK)
