caption: The representation of the role of EPLIN in epithelial–mesenchymal transition
  and metastasis. (A) EPLIN serves as a link between stress fibers (actin filaments)
  and the cadherin–catenin complex within these cells. (B) When EPLIN is downregulated,
  it leads to the dissociation of the adherens junction, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton,
  and activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. Consequently, this cascade of
  events results in the upregulation of EMT-promoting genes, such as Vimentin, and
  induces morphological changes that transform the cells into mesenchymal-like cancer
  cells with highly invasive capabilities. Created with BioRender.com
