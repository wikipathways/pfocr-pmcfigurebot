caption: CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling pathway. CXCL12 is widely expressed in various
  tissues, such as liver, brain, lung, kidney, heart, spleen and bone marrow. Upon
  CXCL12 binding to CXCR4, the G protein is dissociated into Gα and Gβγ subunits,
  which interacts with their downstream target proteins and regulates downstream signaling
  pathways, respectively. The Gβγ subunit activates PLC, which results in the conversion
  of PIP2 to DAG and IP3 and the release of Ca2+, followed by PKC activation and phosphorylation
  of target proteins. Gαi and Gβγ subunits activate PI3K-AKt pathway. Subsequent AKt
  activation regulates gene expression via the NF-қB pathway. Activated AKt also resulted
  in GSK-3 inactivation and β-Catenin stabilization. Stable β-Catenin enters the nucleus
  and activates gene transcription, thereby promoting cell proliferation. AKt activation
  also affects cell proliferation and survival by phosphorylation of inactivated B-cell
  lymphoma-associated cell death agonists. In addition, the Gαi subunit induces Ras
  protein kinase activation, which is subsequently transduced by MAPK signaling, including
  phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The Gαi subunit also inhibits cAMP production, thereby
  activating downstream pathways. Moreover, the binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 activates
  the JAK/STAT pathway independent of the G protein. CXCL12 also mediates CXCR4 receptor
  internalization through GRK-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent interaction
  of CXCR4 with β-arrestin. Upon CXCL12 binding to CXCR7, no classical GPCR-mediated
  signaling is observed, instead signaling preferentially through β-arrestin proteins
