  the protein expression levels of the NF-κB signaling pathway (8 h).
caption: 'The effects of BA on the PCN033-induced NF-κB signaling pathway and the
  protein expression levels of the NF-κB signaling pathway (8 h). The results show
  that the levels of phosphorylated p65 and IκBα were significantly elevated in the
  PCN033 group compared with those of the control group. However, BA significantly
  inhibited the levels of phosphorylated p65 and IκBα induced by PCN033 (## p < 0.01
  vs. control; ### p < 0.001 vs. control; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001)'
