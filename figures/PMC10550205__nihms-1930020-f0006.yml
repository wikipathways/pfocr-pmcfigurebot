figure_title: Reciprocal inhibition between GATA6 and SOX17 with BMP signaling pathway
caption: '(A) Heatmap displaying log2 fold changes in normalized TPMs of GATA6-or
  SOX17-depleted cXEN cells relative to the control for select genes involved in BMP
  signaling and ERK pathways as annotated in gene ontology databases. (B) Heatmap
  displaying log2 fold changes in normalized TPMs of BMP4 treated cXEN cells relative
  to the control for differentially expressed (q < 0.05, 72 h vs. 0h DESeq2) TFs in
  parietal endoderm transcription factor (TF) set (see Fig. 2C) or visceral endoderm
  TF set (see Fig. 2D). (C) Ridgeplot displaying the distributions of expression changes
  comparing 72h BMP4 treated cXEN cells versus the control for core genes of the enriched
  pathways from the MSigDb collection. The significance of pathway enrichments was
  color coded. (D) Summary of proposed model: GATA6 and SOX17 repress VE gene program
  and activate Mycn but opposed by FOXA2. Reciprocal repression between GATA6 and
  SOX17 with BMP signaling modulates the relative expression between PE and VE gene
  programs'
