figure_title: The AKT and ERK signaling pathways in FE25, FE25-PRA, and FE25-PRB without
  or with progesterone treatment.
caption: 'The AKT and ERK signaling pathways in FE25, FE25-PRA, and FE25-PRB without
  or with progesterone treatment. (A) Western blot of AKT expression in FE25, FE25-PRA
  +/− P4. (B) Western blot of ERK expression in FE25, FE25-PRA +/− P4. (C) Western
  blot of AKT expression in FE25, FE25-PRB +/− P4. (D) Western blot of ERK expression
  in FE25, FE25-PRB +/− P4. Protein levels of phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and phospho-ERK
  (p-ERK) were increased after progesterone treatment on FE25-PRA and FE25-PRB compared
  to FE25-PRA or FE25-PRB. After PRA or PRB-transfection, p-AKT and p-ERK were reduced
  relative to FE25. P4: progesterone, PRA: progesterone receptor A, PRB: progesterone
  receptor B; and ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The image was representative
  of n= 3. The number under each lane represented the relative quantitation of the
  expression in FE25'
