figure_title: PAI-1-related signalling pathways were activated after coculture.
caption: PAI-1-related signalling pathways were activated after coculture. (A) Total
  TGFβ1 level in the culture media of monocultured tumor cells, non-activated platelets,
  activated platelets, and B16F10-C3 and 231-GFP cells cocultured with non-activated
  platelets through ELISAs. (B) Western blotting shows the levels of TGFβ/Smad pathway-related
  proteins. (C) The mRNA levels of PAI-1 in B16F10-C3 cells after knocking down TGFβ1,
  TGFBR1, TGFBR2, Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 using siRNAs. (D) PAI-1 protein levels after
  knocking down targeted genes. (E) mRNA levels of PAI-1 in B16F10-C3 cells after
  treatment with the TGFBR1 inhibitor SB431542. (F) The protein levels of p-TGFBR1,
  p-Smad2/3, Smad2-4, and PAI-1 after SB431542 treatment in B16F10-C3 cells. (G) Quantified
  results of the Transwell migration assay in B16F10-C3 cells after SB431542 treatment.
  (H) The protein levels of the PI3K/AKT pathway between monocultured and cocultured
  B16F10-C3 cells with knockdown and overexpression of PAI-1 and recombinant TGFβ1
  protein treatment. The results are displayed as the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P <
  0.01, ***P < 0.001
