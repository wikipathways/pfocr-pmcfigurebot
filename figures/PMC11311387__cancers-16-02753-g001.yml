caption: Schematical representation of sugar nucleotide biosynthesis for various types
  of glycosylation. (a) Uridine diphosphate N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthesis from glucose via the glycolysis-related hexosamine biosynthesis
  pathway (HBP). Other glycolysis-related pathways including the pentose phosphate
  pathway, aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation are also depicted. (b)
  Dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) biosynthesis from Dolichol and mannose. (c)
  Guanosine diphosphate fucose (GDP-fucose) biosynthesis from guanosine diphosphate
  mannose (GDP-mannose) (de novo synthesis) and free cytosolic fucose (salvage pathway)
