  pathway through downregulating METTL3 in HS294T.
caption: Anoectochilus roxburghii extracts inhibit the expression of the WNT pathway
  through downregulating METTL3 in HS294T.(A) This panel details the gene expression
  levels of various RNA m6A regulators in the cells. The data presented here show
  that, of all the regulators assessed, the expression of METTL3 is notably decreased,
  implying a targeted inhibitory effect of the Anoectochilus roxburghii extracts on
  this specific regulator. (B) This portion of the figure quantifies the total RNA
  m6A modification levels, providing evidence of the overall reduction in epigenetic
  markers associated with m6A modification in response to the extract treatment. This
  graph depicts the expression levels of genes within the WNT signalling pathway,
  a crucial cascade in cellular communication that influences cell fate and behaviour.
  Substantial downregulation of these genes was observed, indicating that Anoectochilus
  roxburghii extracts may exert their anticancer effects by modulating this pathway.
  An asterisk (*) signifies a p value of less than 0.05, indicating that the reduction
  in both METTL3 expression and WNT pathway gene expression was statistically significant
  and suggesting a potential causal relationship between the effects of the Anoectochilus
  roxburghii extracts and the observed molecular changes
