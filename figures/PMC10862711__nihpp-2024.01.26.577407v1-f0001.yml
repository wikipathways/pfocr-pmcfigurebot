figure_title: Transcriptomic profiling of esophageal epithelium in complementary datasets
  reveals enrichment of IFN response gene signature during active EoE
caption: (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed IFN signature genes between
  active and remission EoE in the esophageal epithelium single-cell cluster. (B) PCA
  plot showing separation in the comparison of EoE and control patients’ gene expression
  from CD45-depleted epithelial samples using the first three principal components
  that account for most of the variation in the dataset. (C) Volcano plot of DEGs
  in EoE active versus control, CD45-depleted, epithelial cell RNA-seq. (D) GSEA analysis
  revealed the Hallmark IFN-gamma response pathway as the most significantly enriched
  pathway in EoE epithelium. (E) Circos plot of overlapping differentially expressed
  genes in the top 5 significant enriched GSEA pathways from EoE compared to control
