caption: KEGG TNF-α signaling and its association with the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
  The KEGG pathway map displays the PI3K-AKT pathway activated by TNF signaling. TNF
  binds to TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) and mediates intracellular signaling, which activates
  many genes, leading to cell survival and apoptosis. TNFR2 leads to the stimulation
  of PI3K, which then activates AKT and cell survival. Red boxes indicate TNF activation
  of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
