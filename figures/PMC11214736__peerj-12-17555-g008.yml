figure_title: PLAUR accelerated ccRCC proliferation, migration, and invasion via the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
caption: '(A) The Western blotting analysis confirmed the presence of LPLAUR, PI3K,
  p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, HIF- α, and MMP9 in the siNC group and the siPLAUR
  group. Additionally, these proteins were also detected in the SC-79 (AKT activator)
  group and the siPLAUR + SC-79 group. (B) The proliferation ability of ccRCC cells
  in different groups was assessed using the CCK-8 assay. (C) The migration and invasion
  ability of ccRCC cells in different groups was assessed using the Transwell assay.
