caption: The circadian clock system involved in regulating photoperiodic flowering
  in Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice. (A) In Arabidopsis, the circadian clock components
  affect the flowering process mainly by regulating CDFs and the GI-CO-FT module transcriptionally
  and post-transcriptionally. (B) The GI-CO-FT signaling pathway is conserved in rice,
  which is known as the OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a/ RFT1 module. Rice also has some unique components
  and pathways that modulate the heading date, such as Hd1, Ehd1, and Ghd7, which
  are also regulated by the circadian clock. (C) Similarly, there is a conserved flowering
  regulation pathway named the GI (E2)-CO-FT module in soybean. Besides, the GI (E2)-CO-E1-FT
  module also exists in soybean. COP1, CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1; FT1a, FLOWERING
