caption: Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli arginine biosynthetic pathways.
  (A) In E. coli, arginine biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol. argA, NAG synthase;
  argB, NAG kinase; argC, N-acetyl-glutamyl-5-phospate reductase; argD, N-acetyl-ornithine
  amino transferase; argE, N-acetyl ornithine deacetylase; argF/I, ornithine carbamoyl
  transferase; argG, argininosuccinate synthase; argH, argininosuccinate lyase. (B)
  In S. cerevisiae, the arginine biosynthesis starts in the mitochondrial matrix from
  the condensation of glutamate with acetyl-CoA catalyzed by ARG2 and ends with the
  synthesis of ornithine catalyzed by ARG7. Ornithine is then transported to the cytosol
  by ARG11, where it is finally converted to arginine. In S. cerevisiae the mitochondrial
  catabolism of proline may also produce N-acetyl-L-glutamyl-5-semialdehyde bypassing
  the first two steps of the main biosynthetic pathway. Although mechanistically the
  first three steps of the two pathways are not identical (see text for more details),
  the same metabolic intermediates are involved in both species. ARG2, NAG synthase;
  ARG5,6, N-acetylglutamate kinase and N-acetyl-5-glutamyl-phosphate reductase; ARG8,
  N-acetyl-ornithine aminotransferase; ARG7, N-acetyl-ornithine acetyltransferase;
  ARG11, mitochondrial ornithine transporter; ARG3, ornithine carbamoyl transferase;
  ARG1, argininosuccinate synthetase; ARG4, argininosuccinate lyase; PUT1, proline
  oxidase; PUT2, (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase. MPR1, L-azetidine-2-carboxylic
  acid acetyltransferase
