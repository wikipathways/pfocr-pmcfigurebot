caption: The 130 lncRNA cis-target hub genes in modules that significantly correlated
  with JA and DEGs in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and isoflavonoid
  biosynthesis pathway. Each type of factor is marked with various colors. The lncRNA
  MSTRG.50256.1 is marked with a pentagram
