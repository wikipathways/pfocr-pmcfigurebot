figure_title: CD45+ erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) were chemoattracted by hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) macrophages through C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2).
caption: 'CD45+ erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) were chemoattracted by hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) macrophages through C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2). (A) Gene
  set enrichment analysis of the chemokine signaling pathway among CD45+EPCs from
  spleen and tumor tissues of tumor-bearing mice. (B) Volcano plots displaying differentially
  expressed genes associated with chemokine signals. Red dots represent the upregulated
  expressed transcripts (p < 0.05, log2 fold change>1), and green dots represent the
  downregulated expressed transcripts (p < 0.05, log2 fold change>1). (C) Representative
  and statistical analysis of the cumulative fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CCR2
  on CD45-EPCs and CD45+EPCs from cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs), peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (n = 6), and tumor tissues (n = 6) from HCC patients.
  (D) Representative and statistical analysis of MFI of CCR2 on CD45-EPCs and CD45+EPCs
  from bone marrow, spleen and tumor tissues (n = 6) of orthotopic HCC tumor-bearing
  mice. (E, F) Cell migration assay. After 24 h of serum starving, CD45+EPCs from
  spleen of tumor-bearing mice (5Ã—105/mL) were suspended in serum-free medium and
  seeded in the upper chamber. Media containing 10% FBS (v/v) was placed into the
  lower chamber, as well as indicated cells in Matrigel matrix glue in indicated ratios.
  After 24 h, cells that had migrated into the medium of the low chamber were evaluated.
  Representative of one independent experiment, cumulative data are shown (n = 6).
  (G-J) Immunofluorescence staining of tumor. Paraffin tissue sections of human (CD71,
  red; CD235a, green; CD68, purple, DAPI, blue) and mouse (CD71, red; Ter119, green;
  F4/80, purple, DAPI, blue) HCC samples. Linear regression of the abundance of CD71+CD235a+
  cells and macrophages was conducted. ns: non-significant ****p < 0.0001; ***p <
  0.001; **p < 0.01'
