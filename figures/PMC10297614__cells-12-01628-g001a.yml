caption: 'High DDX3X expression is associated with poor outcomes in the liver cancer
  cohort, and canonical pathway analysis of the DDX3X-dependent gene signature reveals
  a correlation with cancer metastasis, PCP and PTEN signaling. (A) A scatter plot
  of the indicated expression patterns in 373 liver cancer patients is shown. A total
  of 423 samples, including normal and tumor tissues, were retrieved from the TCGA
  database, and 50 adjacent normal samples were excluded prior to the analysis. The
  tumor samples were divided into the DDX3X-high and DDX3X-low groups based on the
  cut-off value around the median DDX3X gene expression (FPKM) in cohort. RNA-Seq
  data were retrieved from TCGA (Dataset ID: TCGA.LIHC.sampleMap/HiSeqV2_PANCAN, version:
  2017-10-13). The RNA-Seq read count was normalized and log2 transformed. (B) Kaplan–Meier
  analysis revealed the overall survival of liver cancer patients in the DDX3X-high
  and DDX3X-low groups. (C) A total of 2890 differentially expressed gene targets
  in the DDX3X-high group were selected and are shown after hierarchical clustering
  (1.5-fold change, p value < 0.05). (D) Significant signaling pathways were ranked
  according to the −log p value. Activation and inactivation of the indicated signaling
  pathways were determined by the transformed Z score. (E) The percentage of genes
  overlapping in the indicated signaling pathways is shown. The numbers of upregulated
  and downregulated genes are displayed with red and green bars, respectively. The
  p values are shown on the orange line'
