caption: Metabolic pathway engineering for triacetic acid lactone biosynthesis in
  Rhodotorula toruloides. ACC1, acetyl‐CoA carboxylase; ACL1, ATP‐citrate lyase; ACS1,
  acetyl‐CoA synthetase; PDC1, pyruvate decarboxylase; ALD5, acetylaldehyde dehydrogenase;
  AMPD1, AMP deaminase; CIT2, peroxisomal citrate synthase; DGA1, diacylglycerol acyltransferase;
  GhPS, 2‐pyrone synthase from Gerbera hybrida; LRO1, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase;
  ME1, malic enzyme; MLS1, cytosolic malate synthase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  PEX10, peroxisomal matrix protein; PYC1, pyruvate carboxylase; YLACL1, ATP‐citrate
  lyase from Yarrowia lipolytica. Some metabolites were not positioned following their
  intracellular compartmentalization.
