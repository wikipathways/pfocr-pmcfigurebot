figure_title: Global lipidomic profiling uncovers dysregulated metabolic pathways
  and lipid classes with age in kidney tissues.
caption: 'Global lipidomic profiling uncovers dysregulated metabolic pathways and
  lipid classes with age in kidney tissues. (A) Heatmap showing disrupted and enriched
  lipid classes based on comparisons between young and old kidney tissues. (B) Lipid
  class enrichment (C) and lipid chain length enrichment based on comparisons between
  young and old kidney. Significantly different lipid classes represented in the figures
  are those with adjusted p-values < 0.05 (note: p-values were adjusted to correct
  for multiple comparisons using an FDR procedure) and log fold changes greater than
  1 or less than −1. Young, n= 6; aged, n= 6. For all panels, error bars indicate
  SEM, ** indicates P≤ 0.01; and *P≤ 0.05, calculated with Student’s t-test'
