figure_title: Effects of miR-1 gain- and loss-of-function experiments on RA pathway
  during posterior differentiation of cardiac tube.
caption: 'Effects of miR-1 gain- and loss-of-function experiments on RA pathway during
  posterior differentiation of cardiac tube. RT-qPCR of RNA from the dissected cardiac
  asa of embryos microinjected either with CFDA, premiR-1 or antimiR-1, illustrating
  Raldh2 (A), CrabpII (B) and CrabpI (C). A high level of miR-1 led to an increased
  expression of CrabpII (B) and a decreased expression of CrabpI (C). The opposite
  effect was observed with anti-miR1 treatment. Note that nonsignificant expression
  of Raldh2 (A) was observed after miR-1 overexpression or miR-1 inhibitor treatment,
  as compared to the control (CFDA). Standard deviations are from three independent
  experiments. Student’s t-test: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.001 with respect
  to control (CFDA) embryos'
