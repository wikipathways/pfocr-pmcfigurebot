caption: Salidroside suppresses LPS-induced NET formation by inhibiting the activation
  of the HMGB1 signaling pathway(A) Immunofluorescence analysis of neutrophil extracellular
  trap formation induced by Sal and HMGB1. (B) Representative western blots showing
  proteins associated with the HMGB1/TLR-4/MAPK signaling pathway. (C) Quantitative
  analysis of the western blots. Differences among groups were compared using one-way
  ANOVA. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
