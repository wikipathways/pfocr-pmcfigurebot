figure_title: Transcriptional landscape of the ΔyhdP ΔfadR and suppressed strain
caption: Three biological replicates of the indicated strains were grown at 42 °C
  to mid-log then transferred to 30 °C for 30 minutes before harvesting RNA and performing
  RNA-seq. Differential expression was calculated based on a greater than 2-fold change
  in expression and a p value of less than 0.05 by quasi-linear F-test. (A) PCA was
  performed on the expression of all genes differentially expressed between any groups
  of samples. Suppressor 1 and the ΔyhdP ΔfadR strain grouped closer together than
  to the wild-type strain, although Suppressor 1 was closer to wild type than the
  ΔyhdP ΔfadR strain. (B-D) Volcano plots show the average fold change and significance
  of expression changes between the ΔyhdP ΔfadR strain and wild-type MG1655 (B), Suppressor
  1 and wild-type MG1655 (C), and Suppressor 1 and the ΔyhdP ΔfadR strain (D). Genes
  with changes greater than 2-fold are shown in blue, while genes with changes less
  than 2-fold are shown in grey. Genes with a q-value (false discovery rate) of less
  than 0.05 are shown in yellow. Blue lines indicate a 2-fold change and dotted line
  indicates p>0.05. The number of up or down regulated genes is indicated in blue.
  The names of the 10 genes with the largest changes are called out. More genes were
  up-regulated then down regulated in the ΔyhdP ΔfadR strain and Suppressor 1 vs.
  wild type. More genes were down regulated in Suppressor 1 compared to the ΔyhdP
  ΔfadR strain. (E) Relative expression of genes in the CL synthesis pathway is shown
  as averages ± the SEM and individual data points. No significant changes were evident.
  (F) Relative expression of genes in the fatty acid synthesis and degradation pathways
  is shown as averages ± the SEM and individual data points. A general normalizing
  of these pathways occurred in Suppressor 1 compared to the ΔyhdP ΔfadR strain; however,
  the most significant change was in the expression of fabA. * p<0.05, ** p<0.005,
  *** p<0.0005 by quasi-linear F-test.
