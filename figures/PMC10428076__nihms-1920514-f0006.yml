figure_title: Lack of GPR44 activates KRAS-MAPK signaling in AML cells
caption: (A) Scheme for sequencing analysis. Bone marrow cells were isolated from
  mice secondarily transplanted with 1° WT or Gpr44−/− AML donor cells and LICs were
  flow cytometrically sorted following RBC lysis, Lin− selection, and Sca-1 and c-Kit
  staining. LICs (4 × 105) were used for RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression
  analysis, IPA, and GSEA were performed to compare WT and Gpr44−/− LICs (n = 3 in
  each group).(B) Heatmap for top 100 most differentially regulated genes in WT and
  Gpr44−/− LICs.(C) Volcano plot for differential gene expression analysis between
  WT and Gpr44−/− LICs(D) Heatmap of indicated pathways in WT and Gpr44−/− LICs as
  analyzed by IPA. Z scores were plotted.(E) Expression of Kras assessed by qPCR analysis
  in WT or Gpr44−/− AML cells isolated from bone marrow (left) and spleen (right)
  of 2° AML-recipient mice. Data were normalized to WT AML cells and 18S rRNA expression
  (n = 4–8 biological replicates).(F) Western blot showing the expression of KRAS
  in WT or Gpr44−/− AML cells isolated from 2° AML-recipient mice.(G) Western blot
  showing the expression of MAPK signaling pathway components including P-C-RAF, RAF-1,
  P-MEK3/6, MEK1/2, P-ERK, ERK1/2, P-C-JUN,and β-actin in WT or Gpr44−/− AML cells
  isolated from 2° AML-recipient mice (n = 5–8 biological replicates in each group).(H)
  Western blot showing the expression of P53 in WT or Gpr44−/− AML cells isolated
  from 2° AML-recipient mice. (F and H) Densitometry was done by normalizing to WT
  AML cells and relative to β-actin (n = 3–5 biological replicates in each group).Data
  shown are mean ± SEM per group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
