  blastocysts.
caption: Enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways associated with DEGs in vitrified–warmed
  blastocysts. The scatterplot depicts the enriched KEGG pathways corresponding to
  upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) DEGs. With a false discovery rate (FDR)
  < 0.2 and fold-change ≥ 1.5, the upregulated DEGs were enriched for 6 pathways,
  while the downregulated DEGs were enriched for 7 pathways. Enriched pathways of
  upregulated DEGs such as “Thermogenesis”, “Chemical carcinogenesis-reactive oxygen
  species”, and “Oxidative phosphorylation”. These pathways promote ATP generation,
  affecting cell survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation via the “MAPK
  signaling pathway”. Enriched pathways of downregulated DEGs mostly involved in immune
  responses, such as “Herpes simplex virus 1 infection”, “NF-kappa B signaling pathway”,
  “Autophagy-animal”, “Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway”, and “Glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis”. The x-axis represents the fold enrichment, calculated
  as the ratio of the observed gene frequency in the pathway to the expected frequency,
  based on a random distribution. The y-axis represents the −log10 transformed false
  discovery rate (FDR), where larger dot points indicate lower FDR values and higher
  statistical significance. Pathways positioned towards the left exhibit more significant
  fold enrichments, indicating a higher representation of DEGs in those pathways compared
  to random expectation
