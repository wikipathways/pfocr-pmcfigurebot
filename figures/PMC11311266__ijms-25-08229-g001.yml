figure_title: ABA-mediated drought perception and subsequent epigenetic changes in
  stress response genes.
caption: 'ABA-mediated drought perception and subsequent epigenetic changes in stress
  response genes. This figure illustrates the crosstalk between ABA-mediated drought
  perception and subsequent epigenetic changes in plant stress response genes. The
  left side of the flowchart delineates the epigenetic regulation pathway, initiated
  by ABA signaling in response to drought stress, leading to key molecular changes
  such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the involvement of small regulatory
  RNAs. These epigenetic mechanisms contribute to heritable changes that enhance plant
  resilience to environmental stressors. The right side of the flowchart details the
  ABA signaling pathway, starting with the ABA receptor PYR/PYL/RCAR. Upon ABA binding,
  these receptors inhibit the activity of type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), which
  are negative regulators of ABA signaling. This inhibition activates Snf1-related
  protein kinases 2 (SnRK2s), the key positive regulators and secondary messengers
  in the ABA pathway. The activated SnRK2s phosphorylate transcription factors such
  as ABFs, AREB1, and AREB2, which bind to ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) in gene
  promoters. This binding orchestrates the regulation of gene expression, particularly
  of genes involved in stress responses like HvCKX2.1, DBF1, and DDM1, as well as
  metabolic pathways, thereby modulating the plantâ€™s response to drought stress. Additionally,
  some drought-responsive miRNAs contain ABREs in their promoters, and some drought-responsive
  genes are targets of miRNAs, such as MYB transcription factors, which are repressed
  through miRNA-mediated mRNA decay to help activate specific responses to drought
  stress. The red arrows: down for negative regulation, up for positive regulation'
