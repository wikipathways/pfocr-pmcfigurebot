figure_title: sFRP2 acts on AEC2s through the Fzd5 receptor to promote noncanonical
  Wnt signaling
caption: (A) axin2 gene expression in AEC2s cultured for 48 hours with sFRP2 (60 ng/ml)
  or Wnt3a (100 ng/ml). n = 4–6 biological replicates. *P < 0.05 (B) Dot plot of Frizzled
  receptors and related coreceptors from selected epithelial cells from donor, control
  biopsy, and ILD explant samples. (C) krt5 mRNA levels expressed in AEC2s were measured
  after silencing the expression of fzd5 or fzd6. The silenced fzd5 and silenced fzd6
  AEC2 cells were subsequently treated with 60 ng/ml of sFRP2 for 48 hours. n = 3
  independent biological replicates. (D) Levels of expression of krt5 and axin2 mRNA
  were measured in AEC2 cells treated with CaMKII inhibitor KN93 (1 μg/ml–1) with
  or without sFRP2 (60 ng/ml) for 48 hours. (E) Levels of expression of krt5 and axin2
  mRNA were measured in AEC2 cells treated with tacrolimus (1 μM) with or without
  sFRP2 (60 ng/ml) for 48 hours. (F) Western blot indicating the presence of NFATC3
  in nuclei extract from HEK293 cells transfected with FZD5 plasmid followed by treatment
  with sFRP2 (30 ng/ml) for 1 hour. n = 3 biological replicates. (G) Schematic of
  the sFRP2-FZD5 signaling pathway promoting the expression of KRT5 in AECs. Created
  with BioRender. Statistical significance was determined by Kruskal-Wallis (A), Tukey’s
  test (C), or Dunnett’s test (axin2 in E) and Mann–Whitney t test (D, krt5 in E)
