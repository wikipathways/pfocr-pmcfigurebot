figure_title: RB1 deficiency activates innate immune signaling via the cGAS/STING
  pathway
caption: '(A–E) The comparison of 5 cGAS/STING pathway genes’ expression in TCGA LUAD
  samples with mutated RB1 and WT RB1. (F) Differential expression of 3 cGAS/STING
  genes between RB1-mutant and RB1-WT samples in the Gillette et al. data set (19).
  (G) Communications of the GAS signaling pathway among ME-RB1-H, ME-RB1-L, and other
  cell subtypes. (H) Heatmap shows the communicational probability of GAS signaling
  pathway among cells. The color indicates the strength of communication. (I) Representative
  immunofluorescence images of colocalization of cGAS and cytoplasmic dsDNA fragments
  induced by PARPis in A549-RB1-WT and A549-RB1-KO cells. (J) Western blot analysis
  of RB1, cGAS, STING, p-TBK1/TBK1, and p-IRF3/IRF3 after treatment with DMSO, niraparib,
  and rucaparib in A549-RB1-WT and A549-RB1-KO cells. Normalized to β-actin control.
  (K) qRT-PCR analysis of CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNAs (n = 6). *P < 0.05 vs. A549-RB1-WT.
  (L) Quantitative analysis by ELISA of CCL5 and CXCL10 secretion in A549-RB1-WT and
  A549-RB1-KO cell supernatants upon exposure to PARPis (n = 6). *P < 0.05, **P <
  0.01 vs. A549-RB1-WT. (M) Representative immunofluorescence images of cGAS and cytoplasmic
  dsDNA fragment localization induced by PARPis in H2228 cells transfected with RB1.
  (N) Western blot analysis of RB1, cGAS, STING, p-TBK1/TBK1, and p-IRF3/IRF3 after
  treatment with DMSO, niraparib, and rucaparib in H2228 cells transfected with RB1.
  Normalized to β-actin control. (O) qRT-PCR analysis of CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNAs (n
  = 6). *P < 0.05 vs. H2228-NC. (P) Quantitative analysis by ELISA of CCL5 and CXCL10
  secretion in H2228 cell supernatants upon exposure to PARPis (n = 6). *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01 vs. H2228-NC. (I and M) Green, PicoGreen. Red, cGAS. Blue, DAPI. The
  white arrow represents the colocation of cGAS and dsDNA fragments. Scale bars: 10
  μm. P values were calculated by 1-sided Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test (A–F) and unpaired,
  2-tailed Student’s t test (K, L, O, and P)'
