caption: 'Analysis of significantly different metabolites in serum. (A) Heat maps
  of significantly different metabolite clusters, (B) significantly up-regulated metabolite
  enrichment maps, (A: linoleic acid metabolism B: taurine and subtaurine metabolism;
  C: arachidonic acid metabolism; the abscissa represents the pathway impact value
  calculated by path topology analysis, the ordinate −log10 (P) represents the significance
  level of metabolic pathway enrichment analysis, and the circle size represents the
  ratio of pathway impact to −log10 (P). The larger the ratio, the larger the circle
  diameter.). (C) KEGG pathways for taurine and hypotaurine, (D) KEGG pathways for
  arachidonic acid, and (E) KEGG pathways for cysteine and methionine metabolism'
