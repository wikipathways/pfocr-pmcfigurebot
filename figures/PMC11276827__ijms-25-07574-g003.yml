caption: Results of a network pharmacology analysis. (A) PPT treatment of depression
  Venn diagram. (B) PPI network of potential targets for PPT treatment of depression,
  the connecting lines indicate their interactions, and the node sizes and color shades
  are proportional to their degree. (C) GO enrichment analysis of PPT for depression.
  (D) KEGG enrichment analysis of PPT for depression. (E) The “target-pathway” network
  diagram has green nodes representing potential protein targets and blue nodes representing
  pathways
