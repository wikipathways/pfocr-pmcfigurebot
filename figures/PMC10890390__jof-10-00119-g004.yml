figure_title: Optimization of the terminators in NAG biosynthetic pathway.
caption: Optimization of the terminators in NAG biosynthetic pathway. (a) Terminator
  combinations used in this study for tuning half-life of NAG biosynthetic pathway
  gene mRNA. (b) NAG production when terminators are replaced separately in NAG biosynthetic
  pathway. (c) Optimization of different combinations of terminators in NAG biosynthetic
  pathway. “−” indicates that the terminators used by the genes corresponding to the
  left side of “−” have not been replaced, and “+” indicates that the terminators
  used by the genes corresponding to the left side of “+” have been replaced with
  the terminators below “+”. Statistically significant differences between two data
  groups were determined using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (one-tailed; two-sample
  unequal variance; * p < 0.05). All data represent the mean of n = three biologically
  independent samples, and error bars show standard deviation
