figure_title: Sodium chloride activation of macrophages may involve SGK1, the MAPK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway and sodium transporter.
caption: 'Sodium chloride activation of macrophages may involve SGK1, the MAPK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway and sodium transporter. (a) Heatmap of differential gene changes
  in Raw264.7 macrophages under LPS and LPS + NaCl treatment detected by RNA-seq.
  (b) Volcano map of differentially expressed genes between pretreated with NaCl (50mM)
  and LPS-stimulated and LPS-stimulated alone group. Red dots represent up-regulated
  genes, blue dots represent down-regulated genes, and the genes labeled in the figure
  are genes related to sodium ion reabsorption. (c) KEGG pathway analysis of differentially
  expressed genes between LPS and LPS + NaCl groups. (d-e) Gene set enrichment analysis
  (GSEA) showing the cells pretreated with NaCl (50mM) enriched the MAPK (d) and NF-κB
  (e) pathway compared with the LPS+ATP group. (f) The heat map of significantly changed
  genes associated with sodium reabsorption. (g) RT-qPCR was used to detect the gene
  changes closely related to sodium ion. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. ###p<0.001,
  n=3. (h) The SoNa 520 AM system was used to detect macrophage Na+ influx under treatment
  with 50 mM or free conditions. (i) Representative western blot images of the effect
  of sodium chloride on the expression of Slc6a12, SGK1, p-SGK1, Atp1a3 and Hmox1in
  RAW264.7 cell. (j-k) Western blot was used to examine the effect of different concentration
  of NaCl on NF-κB p65 and MAPK p38 phosphorylation in Raw264.7 and THP-1-derived
  macrophages'
