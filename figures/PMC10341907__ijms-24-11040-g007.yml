caption: Proposals of the action mechanisms of the terpenes present in BSEO in the
  proliferative phase. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived
  endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), fibroblast growth
  factor (FGF), metalloproteinases (MMPs), epidermal growth factor (EGF), keratinocyte
  growth factor (KGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α), transforming growth
  factor beta (TGF-β), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Dotted lines indicate
  specific sites where monoterpenes act. (+) Indicates activation of the signaling
  pathway
