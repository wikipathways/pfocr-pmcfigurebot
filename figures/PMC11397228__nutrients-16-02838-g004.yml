caption: The impact of BPs on metabolic disease treatment via gut microbiota modulation.
  BPs, upon ingestion, play a pivotal role in regulating gut microbiota. This can
  shift the microbial imbalance seen in patients with metabolic diseases toward a
  state of equilibrium. They also promote the production of beneficial metabolic byproducts
  in the gut, like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs). The synergetic
  action of the gut microbiota and its metabolites strengthens the intestinal barrier
  in metabolic disease patients. This enhancement leads to a reduction in lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS) entering the circulatory system and subsequently decreases inflammation in
  adipose tissue, liver, and cardiovascular system—actions that are vital in mitigating
  metabolic diseases. Moreover, microbial metabolites such as SCFAs trigger the secretion
  of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from enteroendocrine L cells in the intestines.
  This secretion influences pancreatic islets by reducing islet cell apoptosis and
  boosting insulin production, consequently diminishing insulin resistance (IR), which
  is instrumental in treating Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). SCFAs also impact the
  body’s white adipose tissue, enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation and hindering fat
  accumulation, which is crucial in obesity treatment. Additionally, in the liver,
  SCFAs elevate lipid β-oxidation and inhibit lipid synthesis, thereby aiding in non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease (NAFLD) management. Specific BAs, like GUDCA and HCA, activate
  GLP-1 secretion from enteroendocrine L cells by engaging the Takeda G protein-coupled
  receptor 5 (TGR5). This action can spur insulin release and improve insulin sensitivity
  through its circulatory effect on pancreatic islets, aiding in the body’s glucose
  metabolism regulation. In an alternate pathway, BAs interact with the brain via
  the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), modulating energy and glucose metabolism to enhance
  satiety and reduce food intake. Furthermore, through the FXR/FGF19 pathway, BAs
  can regulate glucose and energy metabolism within the brain. These mechanisms support
  the overall alleviation of metabolic diseases. Additionally, BAs can enhance cardiac
  function by activating TGR5/FXR receptors, thereby achieving the mitigation or treatment
  of CVD. The red downward arrow in the figure indicates a decrease or downregulate,
  while the blue upward arrow signifies an increase or upregulate
