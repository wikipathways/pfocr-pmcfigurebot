caption: The engineering CXCL12 biomimetic decoy-integrated versatile immunosuppressive
  nanoparticle (VIN) for the management of overactivated brain immune microenvironment.
  The shell of the VIN serves two key functions, namely, enhancing the homing of the
  nanoparticles to cerebral ischemic lesions and effectively adsorbing and neutralizing
  CXCL12. In that way, infiltration of peripheral neutrophils and mononuclear macrophages
  is blocked. Additionally, the VIN is loaded with A151, which can inhibit the cGASâ€“STING
  pathway. This inhibition leads to the polarization of microglia towards an anti-inflammatory
  M2-like phenotype. As a result, the VIN demonstrates remarkable therapeutic effects
  in terms of reducing mortality rates, minimizing infarct volume, and protecting
  the neurogenic functions of neurons. Reprinted from Shi et al. (2022), with permission
