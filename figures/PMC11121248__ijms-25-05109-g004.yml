  and reduces apoptotic signaling.
caption: MerTK enhances several signaling pathways, progresses the cell cycle, and
  reduces apoptotic signaling. (A). The NanoString pathway score analysis showed that
  SUM102-MerTK clones obtained high or low scores in 5 signaling pathways (PI3K-AKT,
  PDGF, Myc, the cell cycle, and apoptosis) compared to SUM102-V clones. (B). The
  relative fold change of gene expression in members of each signaling pathway is
  shown in SUM102-MerTK clones following normalization to SUM102-V. n = 4. ns = not
  significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. (C). Whole-cell lysates were harvested from
  SUM102-MerTK or SUM102-V clones. Immunoblotting was performed to detect indicated
  phospho- or total protein expression levels. Representative Gapdh was shown and
  used as a loading control
