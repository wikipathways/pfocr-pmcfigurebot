caption: RSPH14 is involved in the oncogenic role of lnc-ZEB2-19. The effects of RSPH14
  on HCC cell migration ability from wound healing assays (A) and invasion ability
  from Transwell assays (B), and sphere-formation ability (C). The variation of EMT
  (F) and stemness (E) protein level were proved by Western blot. The sensibility
  of lenvatinib was verified by IC50 assays (D). The rescue experiments were conducted
  to confirm the reverse ability to knock down RSPH14 on the migration ability (G),
  invasion ability (H), EMT (I), sphere-formation ability (J), stemness (L), and sensibility
  of Lenvatinib (K) in HCC cells. The regulatory role of Lnc-ZEB2-19 (M) and RSPH14
  (N) on the NF-κB signaling pathway was confirmed by western blot. (O) knocking down
  RSPH14 reversed the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway induced by silencing
  Lnc-ZEB2-19
