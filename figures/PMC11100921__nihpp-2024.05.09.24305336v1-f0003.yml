figure_title: The mTOR signaling pathway is upregulated in enhanced response to MUC1
  vaccination
caption: '(A) Heatmap showing top differentially enriched pathways from the Hallmark
  Gene Set (MSigDB) in the PBMCs from high responders (HR) vs. non-responders (NR)
  at Baseline. Group status is indicated in the row above the heatmap as follows:
  high responders (HR) - pink, while non-responders (NR) - light blue. Z-scored normalized
  pathway enrichment log 2 fold-change and p values are displayed as in Figure 1.
  Unsupervised clustering of the samples is indicated at the top of the heatmap, while
  clustering of the pathways is displayed on the far left. (B) Violin plots showing
  the level of S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation in the indicated cell subsets
  (CD4, CD8, CD19/B-cells and CD14/monocytes). (C) Violin plots showing the level
  of AKT1 phosphorylation in the indicated cell subsets (CD4, CD8, CD19/B-cells and
  CD14/monocytes). For all violin plots, geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
  is shown on the y-axis. Responders (R) and non-responders (NR) are designated by
  dark blue and light blue respectively'
