  The GeneMANIA is a prediction server used for biological network integration for
  gene prioritization and predicting gene function. The server additionally adds genes
  based on known interactions. Additional genes are represented by gray, unstriped
  circles. Selected genes are represented by circles with stripes. The colors of the
  line suggest the type of interaction, that is, red—physical interactions; purple—co-expression;
  orange—predicted; blue—co-localization; light blue—pathway; green—genetic interactions;
  olive—shared protein domains. Interactors are shown with the official gene symbol.
  NAALAD2 is the only gene found outside the network. Most studies indicate that NAALAD2
  is involved in prostate cancer. Sidorkiewicz et al. [4] may be the first to have
  correlated this gene with endometrial cancer (EC). However, the expression of NAALAD2
  was decreased in the endometrium during cancer [4]. Abbreviations: AGER—the gene
  encoding receptor advanced glycation end-products; ENO2—enolase 2; ENO1—enolase
  1; PKM—pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2; PGAM2—phosphoglycerate mutase 2; ENO3—enolase
  3; CCNA1—cyclin A1; ENO4—enolase 4; ENOSF1—enolase superfamily member 1; CLYBL—citramalyl-CoA
  lyase; NAALAD2—N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase 2; LAMA4—laminin subunit
  alpha 4; COL6A3—collagen type VI alpha 3 chain; NR2F1—nuclear receptor subfamily
  2 group F member 1; PDP2—pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 2;
  PDPR—pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase regulatory subunit; PDP1—pyruvate dehydrogenase
  phosphatase catalytic subunit 1; PDK1—pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; RUNX1—RUNX
  family transcription factor 1; RUNX2—RUNX family transcription factor 2; RUNX3—RUNX
  family transcription factor 3; CCNA1—cyclin A1; LDHA—lactate dehydrogenase A; LDHB—lactate
  dehydrogenase B; BSG—basigin; PKLR—pyruvate kinase L/R; PGAM1—phosphoglycerate mutase
  1; SLC25A1—solute carrier family 25 member 1; SLC7A5—solute carrier family 7 member
