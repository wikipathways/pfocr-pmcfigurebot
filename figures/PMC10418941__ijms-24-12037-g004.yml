caption: An overview of the LSCs mechanism that employs fat as fuel. The LSCs are
  responsible for maintaining the process of lipolysis in adipocytes. This metabolic
  pathway leads to the breakdown of stored lipids, resulting in the production of
  free fatty acids. These free fatty acids play a crucial role in enhancing the process
  of Î²-oxidation within the cells. Alpha-ketoglutarate is important in providing the
  building blocks for the synthesis of collagen and amino acids, such as glutamine
  and glutamate, which are required for these metabolic activities. Glutamine is a
  necessary ingredient for the survival of cancer stem cells. In hypoxia, a condition
  characterized by insufficient oxygen supply, it is observed that Nanog exhibits
  a direct binding affinity toward the enhancer region of the BNIP3L promoter. This
  interaction leads to the release of BECLIN from its association with Bcl-2. Consequently,
  this dissociation facilitates an upregulation in the expression of BECLIN
