caption: 'ScRNA-Seq analysis reveals distinct cluster contributed by the mutant Idh1
  expressing chondrocytes: A) Violin plots showing the expression of top feature genes
  in the distinct cluster 6 - Cdsn, Tenm4, Sfrp5, and Slc7a3. B&C) Immunofluorescence
  for Sfrp5 and Cdsn from representative mutant and control growth plates; B) Sfrp5
  protein expression was detected in resting (RC), proliferating (PC) and prehypertrophic
  (pHC) chondrocytes in the mutant while it was restricted to few cells in the PC
  and pHC chondrocytes in the control; C) Cdsn protein was detected in PC and pHC
  zones (white arrows) in Idh1 mutant and absent in the control growth plates; D)
  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of cluster 6 showing upregulated (shown in red)
  and downregulated (shown in blue) pathways; E) GSEA plot showing that cartilage
  development is downregulated in cluster 6'
