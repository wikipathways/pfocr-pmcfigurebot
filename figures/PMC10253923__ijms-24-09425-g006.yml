caption: 'TS263 precisely regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway. (A) WB analysis of
  the key factor in JNK, ERK, P38, and TGF-β signaling pathway. The molecular weights
  of JNK, ERK, P38 and smad2/3 are ~46 kDa and~54 kDa (two bands), ~42 kDa and ~44
  kDa (two bands), ~38 kDa, and ~60 kDa, respectively. (B,C) Comparison of the protein
  abundance of Smad2/3 and P-Smad2/3. (D–G) RT-PCR analysis of the key gene in JNK,
  ERK, P38, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Re-expression refers to relative expression.
  (H) Live and dead analysis of cell viability. (I) EdU staining for detecting cell
  proliferation. The data was presented as the mean ± SEM (error bar). For significant:
  * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.001, versus Null group. ns, not significant'
