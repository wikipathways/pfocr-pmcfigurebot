  pathway.
caption: 'Fibulin-2 (FBLN2) induces HCC proliferation through increasing the Ras-MEK-ERK1/2
  pathway. (A) The expression of FBLN2 protein in HCC cells after stable transduction.
  (B) The stably indicated HCC cells were subjected to colony-formation assay. Left
  panel: representative images of the colony formation; right panel: quantification
  for the number of clones. (C) Cell viability analysis shows that FBLN2 promoted
  HCC cell proliferation. (D) Western blotting shows the protein expression of the
  MAPK signaling pathway in HCC with the FBLN2 overexpression or downregulation. *P
