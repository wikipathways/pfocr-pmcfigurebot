  (C) in plants.
caption: 'The biosynthetic pathway of terpenoids (A), alkaloids (B), and phenylpropanoids
  (C) in plants. The orange shaded area represents endogenous metabolic pathways present
  in microorganisms. The catalytic enzymes are shown in blue, intermediates in black.
  Solid arrow represents one step reaction, and dashed arrow represents multiple steps.
  The structures of typical natural products with underlines are displayed. Green
  circles indicate compounds for which the synthesis pathways have not been fully
  elucidated. Abbreviations: DXS,1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; DXR, 1deoxy-D-xylulose
