figure_title: MIF downregulates adipose LPL expression through a CXCR/Akt signaling
  pathway
caption: '(A–C) Recombinant mouse MIF protein (400 ng/mL) was incubated with differentiated
  3T3-L1 adipocytes for 24 hours, and LPL expression and activity were measured. Mature
  adipocytes were initially isolated from WT and Cd74–/– mice, and suspended cells
  were treated with vehicle or recombinant mouse MIF (rMIF, 400 ng/mL) for 24 hours.
  (D) Lpl gene was quantified by qPCR. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, rMIF was incubated with
  the CXCR2 or CXCR4 inhibitors, SB225002 (400nM) and WZ811 (5μM). (E and F) The levels
  of Lpl gene and proteins and Akt phosphorylation were subsequently evaluated. (G)
  MIF regulated Akt phosphorylation and LPL protein expression in the presence of
  insulin were assessed by Western blot. All data are analyzed by Student’s t test
  or 1-way ANOVA and presented as mean ± SD. *P ≤ 0.05 increase vs. rMIF group in
  E, vs. other groups in G; #P ≤ 0.05 reduction vs. vehicle in A–D and G, vs. other
  groups in E and F, vs. insulin in G'
