figure_title: The C terminal of HCF-1 rescue DNA damage and the type I IFN pathway
  in Ogt−/− cells
caption: A) Volcano plot of OGT binding proteins identified by LC–MS/MS from stably
  expressed exogenous GFP-OGT in OGT knockout HT29 cells. B) OGT and HCF1 binding
  was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay in OGT rescued HT29 cells. C) OGT and
  HCF1 binding was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay in 293T cells. D) HCF1 cleavage
  was confirmed by western blot in Ogt rescued MC38 cells. E) Co-IP analysis of the
  interaction between OGT and different HCF-1 mutant. F) Real-time PCR analysis of
  cytokines mRNA expression effected by HCF-1 isoforms in MC38 OGT knockout cells.
  G) Western blot analysis of γH2AX and H2AX expression in exogenous HCF-1C600 expressed
  MC38 Ogt knockout cells. H) The extranuclear dsDNA were determined by anti-dsDNA
  fluorescence staining assay and was quantified by image J in exogenous HCF-1C600
  expressed MC38 OGT knockout cells. Data are representative of three or four independent
  experiments. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ns, no significant difference. Data represent
  the mean of ± SD
