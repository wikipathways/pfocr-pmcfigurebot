caption: Schematic model of the function and mechanism of PARP inhibitor in thyroid
  cancers. Niraparib not only promotes the DNA damage accumulation in TCs but also
  inhibits the transcription of DIMT1 through promoting Pol II pausing in a PAR-dependent
  manner, which leads to a global translation shut-down in TCs. Meanwhile, niraparib
  activates the NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting the PARylation of p65, which
  decreases its ubiquitination and degradation level through E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146.
  Moreover, inhibition of the NF-κB pathway augmented the antitumor effect of niraparib
  in TCs
