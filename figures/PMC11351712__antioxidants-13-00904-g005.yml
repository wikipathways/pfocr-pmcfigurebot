figure_title: Activation of the Hh signaling pathway protects endothelial cells by
  regulating apoptotic signaling.
caption: Activation of the Hh signaling pathway protects endothelial cells by regulating
  apoptotic signaling. (A,B) The levels of Bcl-2 and Bax in HUVECs were detected by
  IF staining and Western blotting. At 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IR, Shh overexpression
  resulted in a reduction in apoptosis rates, as evidenced by an increase in Bcl-2
  expression and a decrease in Bax expression. (C,D) The number of β-gal-positive
  cells in the IR and IR+NC groups was significantly greater than that in the blank
  group, and the number of β-gal-positive cells in the IR+Shh group was significantly
  lower. n = 5, * p < 0.05, scale = 200 μm. (E) Western blotting was used to detect
  the expression of p53, p21, and p16. (F) Quantitative analysis of p53 protein expression
  level, n = 3. The data are shown as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM);
  ns (not significant), * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01), and **** (p < 0.0001) indicate
  significant differences
