caption: 'Overview of the fatty acid de novo and lipid biosynthetic pathways (prokaryotic
  and eukaryotic) in chloroplast and endoplasmic reticulum with major lipid remodelling
  changes occurring in the pathways under high-temperature conditions. Prokaryotic
  pathway lipids are represented in yellow and eukaryotic lipids are represented in
  red. Lipids highlighted in blue are decreased, and those highlighted in black increase
  under high temperatures. The figure showing the steps of fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis
  is modified from Holzl and Dormann [] and Higashi and Saito []. Collectively, the
  light and dark reactions of photosynthesis yield pyruvate. The pyruvate dehydrogenase
  in chloroplast links the pyruvate metabolism and de novo fatty acid biosynthesis
  yielding the acetyl-CoA. Several condensation steps occur to provide 16:0-ACP, 18:0-ACP,
  and 18:1-ACP for prokaryotic lipid synthesis pathway or exported into ER for utilisation
  in eukaryotic lipid synthesis pathway. The fatty acids exported to ER are then made
  into DAGs and exported back to chloroplast for plastidic lipid synthesis. Under
  high temperatures, overall contribution of prokaryotic pathway for galactolipid
  synthesis is reduced, and eukaryotic pathway is increased. Abbreviations: FFA, free
  fatty acid;16:0, palmitic acid; 16:3, hexadecatrienoic acid; 18:0, stearic acid;
  18:1, oleic acid; 18:2, linoleic acid; 18:3, linolenic acid; ACP, acyl carrier protein;
  Gro-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; CDP, cytidine diphosphate; CTP, cytidine triphosphate;
  UDP, uridine diphosphate; DAG, diacyl glycerol; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid, PA,
  phosphatidic acid; PG, phosphatidyl glycerol; PC, phosphatidyl choline; PE, phosphatidyl
  ethanolamine; PS, phosphatidyl serine; PI, phosphatidyl inositol; PI(4,5)-bP, phosphatidyl
  inositol-4,5-bisphosphate; MGDG, monogalactosyl diacylglycerol; DGDG, digalactosyl
  diacylglycerol; SQDG, sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol; MDA, malondialdehyde.'
