caption: Metabolic pathway analysis after 1 week (A,B) and 8 weeks (C,D) of HFD intervention.
  MetaboAnalyst with the KEGG database was used to analyse z-scores from metabolites
  with VIP > 1 in OPLS regression for combined MS and NMR spectroscopy data. Panels
  (A,C) show the pathway impact determined using MetaboAnalyst and respective significance
  (p-values). Graphs in panels (B,D) include significant findings, that is pathways
  with unadjusted p < 0.05. Orange symbols and blue bars represent number of hits
  (metabolites analysed in that pathway) and −log10(P), respectively. Bars highlighted
  with black border indicate pathways in which significance survives false discovery
  rate (FDR) correction. Pathways with impact score = 0 are not represented in (A,C)
  but are listed in (B,D). Dashed lines in panels (A,C) indicate p = 0.05
