figure_title: Guild-based microbiome classification of a 16-member SynCom based on
  translational efficiency (TE)
caption: a) Conceptual overview of TE as a readout of functional prioritization for
  each microbe in a 16-member SynCom isolated from the switchgrass rhizosphere, where
  each member has a limited amount of resources (ribosomes) to allocate for protein
  translation. TE is computed as the metaRibo-Seq/metaRNA-Seq ratio, i.e. the ratio
  between translated mRNA and total mRNA detected at one given instant in the sample;
  b) PCA cluster plot and c) dendrogram of TE on 275 KEGG25 metabolic pathways (n=4
  replicates) allowed classification of the 16 SynCom members into 6 different guilds,
  in which microbes share similar metabolic pathway prioritizations, as detailed in
  Suppl. Table S1 and in Suppl. Fig. S2; d) phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences
  shows substantial differences with the TE-based guild dendrogram c), indicating
  that guilds are not based solely on phylogeny. Note, two bacteria (Mycobacterium
  and Marmoricola) had low KEGG pathway coverage due to low abundance in the community
  (0.04 and 0.13 % of total reads, respectively), and thus are absent from b) and
  c)
