caption: The roles of the MAP kinase and NF-κB signaling pathways in mediating ECFP/Ang
  II-induced NHE3 expression in wild-type and Agtr1a-/- mPCT cells. Panel (A) shows
  that in wild-type mPCT cells, ECFP/Ang II stimulated NHE3 expression significantly,
  and the response was attenuated by the MEK1/MEK2 kinase inhibitor U0126 and the
  NF-κB activation inhibitor Ro 106–9920, respectively. However, the MEK inhibitor
  PD 980659 and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB202196 failed to attenuate the effect
  of ECFP/Ang II on NHE3 expression. Panel (B) shows that in Agtr1a-/- mPCT cells,
  ECFP/Ang II failed to stimulate NHE3 expression, and the inhibitors of the MAP kinases
  and NF-κB signaling pathways had no significant effects on NHE3 expression. ** p
