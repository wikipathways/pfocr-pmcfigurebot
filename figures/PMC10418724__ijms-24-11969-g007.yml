caption: Schematic representation of the traditional and new glucose metabolism. (A)
  Traditional concept of glucose-dependent ATP production introduced by Warburg. The
  Warburg effect explains the role of glucose deprivation in cancer cell death as
  ATP depletion-mediated breakdown of cell homeostasis resulting in cell cycle arrest,
  protein aggregation, and autophagy activation. Recently, we proposed that the major
  metabolic pathway of ATP production in cancer cells is fatty acid oxidation (FAO)
  using fatty acids systemically supplied from the blood (Kim effect). (B) GSC are
  sensitive to glucose deprivation, which induces cell death by increasing ROS production
  through the downregulation of NADPH, resulting in decreased ATP production. (C)
  GIC did not show a decrease of ATP levels after glucose deprivation for 24 h. Although
  NADPH production was reduced by glucose deprivation through the depletion of PPP
  intermediates in both GIC and GSC, GIC did not show an increase in ROS levels mediated
  by a ROS tolerance mechanism such as the GSHR system. However, the exact mechanism
  of ROS tolerance in GIC remains to be elucidated (?)
