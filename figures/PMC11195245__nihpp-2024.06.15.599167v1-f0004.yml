figure_title: Overview of cell-cell interaction analysis in sural nerves with moderate
  and severe axonal loss
caption: 'A, C) Heatmap showing the overall contribution of signaling pathways in
  the enriched cell types in a sample with moderate axonal loss (A) and in a sample
  with severe axonal loss (C). Values are scaled per row. B, D) Circle plot displaying
  all the interactions in each cell group in moderate (B) and severe (D) axonal loss.
  The thickness of each line illustrates the quantity of interactions between two
  distinct cell types, whereas the size of each dot signifies the overall quantity
  of interactions that involve that particular cell type. E, F) Chord diagram displaying
  the interactions within the collagen signaling pathway network in moderate (E) and
  severe (F) axonal loss nerves. Analysis and plots generated using Cellchat package
  (45). EC: Endothelial cells, SC: Schwann cells; FB: Fibroblasts; IC: Immune cells;
  AC: Adipocytes'
