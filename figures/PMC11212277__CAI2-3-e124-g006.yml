caption: High rate of lactate production is a hallmark of triple‐negative breast cancer
  (TNBC). Venn diagram of the common upregulated (a) and downregulated (b) differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in MDA‐MB‐231 cells exposed to different concentrations of
  2‐deoxy‐d‐glucose (2‐DG). Venn plot of the common upregulated (c) and downregulated
  (d) DEGs in MDA‐MB‐231 cells exposed to different concentrations of l‐lactate. (e,
  f) Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment
  and transcription factor analyses of the DEGs. (g) Schematic representation of the
  lactate synthesis pathway. (h) Levels of lactate in different BC cell lines. (i)
  Cell Counting Kit‐8 (CCK‐8) assessment of MDA‐MB‐231 cell growth following exposure
  to 2‐DG or l‐lactate. (j, k) Expression levels of glucose transporter and lactate
  dehydrogenase in different subtypes of BC. (l–n) Correlations between the 14 lactate‐responsive
  genes (LRGs) and the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB) lactate and cancer hallmark
  gene sets.
article_title: A lactate‐responsive gene signature predicts the prognosis and immunotherapeutic
  response of patients with triple‐negative breast cancer.
