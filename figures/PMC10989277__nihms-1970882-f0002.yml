figure_title: PKR signaling is required for XRN1 gene essentiality
caption: (A) Representative immunoblots showing XRN1, phospho-PKR, total PKR, and
  β-actin protein levels in XRN1 KO-insensitive (A549 and NCI-H460) and XRN1 KO-sensitive
  (HCC366 and NCI-H1650) cells 7 days after CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of control loci
  or XRN1. At least three independent biological replicates were performed for each
  cell line. Molecular weight (MW) markers are shown in kilodaltons (kDa).(B) Heatmaps
  showing relative transcripts per million (TPM) values for the indicated differentially
  expressed genes involved in the integrated stress response, the NF-κB pathway, and
  the interferon response pathway (rows) 7 days after CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of control
  loci or XRN1 (columns) in HCC366 cells. Red, increased expression; blue, decreased
  expression (as shown on the right side of the diagram). Three independent biological
  replicates were obtained for each condition.(C) Immunofluorescence analysis of G3BP1
  and Hoechst staining 7 days after CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of control loci or XRN1
  in HCC366 cells (left panels). Scale bars, 20 μm. The percentage of cells containing
  at least one focus of G3BP1 staining was calculated in multiple fields across two
  independent biological experiments (right panel). Error bars represent standard
  deviation from the mean. *** p < 0.001, as calculated by one-way ANOVA.(D–F) (Top
  panels) Immunoblots confirming depletion of PKR (D), MAVS (E), or RNase L (F) protein
  levels after CRISPR-Cas9 targeting in HCC366 cells. β-actin was used as a loading
  control. MW markers are shown in kDa. (Middle panels) Cell viability was assessed
  by ATP bioluminescence 12 days after CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of control loci or XRN1
  in PKR-depleted (D), MAVS-depleted (E), or RNase L-depleted (F) HCC366 cells. ATP
  bioluminescence values were normalized to the control sg1 sample within each cell
  line. Each dot represents the average of three technical replicates from one of
  three independent biological replicates. Error bars represent standard deviation
  from the mean. ***p < 0.001 and ns = not significant, as calculated by repeated
  measures two-way ANOVA. (Bottom panels) Crystal violet staining 17 days after CRISPR-Cas9
  targeting of control loci or XRN1 in PKR-depleted (D), MAVS-depleted (E), or RNase
  L-depleted (F) HCC366 cells. Crystal violet images are representative of three independent
  biological replicates.See also Figure S2; Tables S2 and S3
