caption: 'Oxidative stress, reduced glutathione (GSH) and lung diseases. (1) Lung
  diseases affect alveolar cells increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production,
  reduce Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) redox regulator pathway and become
  defective for surfactant production. Damaged/apoptotic cells cause alveolar cell
  activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and release cytokines like interleukin (IL)-8.
  Alveolar type I cells augment ROS production via toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1 and
  2. Inflammation enhances neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release and increases
  ROS production. (2) Inflammation associated to lung diseases augments macrophage’s
  ROS production, inhibiting Nrf2 activation and enhancing NF-κB upregulation. ROS
  are counterbalanced by enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (Cat),
  glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) to protect cells
  from oxidative damage caused by nicotinamide adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
  oxidase 2 (NOX2), superoxide (O2–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and myeloperoxidase
  (MPO). Capillary neutrophils migrate to and from alveoli by trans-endothelial (TEM)
  and reverse transmigration (rTEM), respectively. Inflammation can cause excessive
  ROS production in capillaries, red blood cell (RBC) dysfunction, thrombosis and
  alveolar damage. (3) Activated alveolar macrophages release increased levels of
  IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Inflammation-associated activated
  macrophages (via TLRs) reduce enzymes like SOD and Cat, among others, and activate
  NF-κB. NOX2 activation increases ROS production that enhance NF-κB activation. Glutathione
  (GSH) precursors (Cystine, cysteine, N-acetyl cysteine, NAC), and selenium (Se)
  restore GSH and GPx, respectively, to counteract the effects of ROS. (4) Alveolar
  macrophages engulf microbes and apoptotic cells via Fc (γ/α/μ) and scavenger receptors
  and/or pattern recognition protein receptors (PRPRs) leading to increased ROS production
  and cytokine release. MPO, nitric oxide (NO), O2–, and H2O2 through the Fenton and
  Haber-Weiss reactions that generate hydroxyl radicals, participate in ROS and RNS
  generation. Lung disease-associated inflammation and apoptosis [via TLRs and glycosaminoglycans
  (GAGs)] enhance alveolar cell ROS production that via p38MAPK, NF- κB, and AP-1
  activation, contribute to epithelial injury and further inflammation. (5) Neutrophils
  contribute to O2– production, lipid peroxidation and increased oxidative stress
  to promote a cytokine storm (). Administration of GSH precursors [cystine, cysteine,
  NAC; see (3), (4), and (5)] facilitate GSH formation to reduce oxidative stress.
