caption: Immune component of inflammation-induced EMT in lung cancer. (A) Granulocytes,
  namely neutrophils and eosinophils, induce EMT through TGF-β/Smad signaling. CysLTs
  increase TGF-β production in eosinophils in an autocrine manner. (B) TAMs induce
  EMT in lung cancer by releasing IL-6, CCL2, and TGF-β. IL-6 and CCL2 share the same
  downstream JAK2/STAT3 signaling and mutually upregulate each other to induce EMT.
  (C) Mast cells release chymase, which reduces cell–cell adhesion by cleaving E-cadherin.
  Inhibition of the p52 tumor suppressor can be mentioned as another process induced
  by chymase in lung cancer cells. Mast cells secrete TGF-β-coated EVs that induce
  the classical Smad-dependent pathway. However, EVs contain other EMT-inducing molecules
  as they activate the phosphorylation of many proteins in lung cancer cells involved
  in PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, NF-κB, and HIF-1 signaling pathways, as well as the formation
  of focal adhesions and tight junctions
