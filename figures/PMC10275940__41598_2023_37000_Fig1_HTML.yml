caption: Mutation analysis and gene expression of pyruvate metabolism-related genes
  in patients with HCC from TCGA-LIHC cohort. (A) The frequency of CNV mutations in
  genes related to pyruvate metabolism. (B) The proportion of SNV mutations in genes
  related to pyruvate metabolism. (C) Comparison of pyruvate metabolic pathway score
  between tumor tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues. (D) The expression level of
  pyruvate metabolism-related genes in tumor tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues.
