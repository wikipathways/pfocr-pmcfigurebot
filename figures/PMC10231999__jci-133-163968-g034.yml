  expression
caption: (A) Heatmap of DEGs related to Ca2+ signaling pathway after 30 days of the
  indicated drug treatment. (B–F) WB analysis was performed to measure the protein
  levels of Nfatc3, Irg1, and Il-1β (p17 and pro–Il-1β) after 30 days of the indicated
  drug treatment. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005, and ****P
  < 0.0001, by 1-way ANOVA. (G–I) Heatmaps of DEGs of proinflammatory factors, chemokines,
  cell-adhesion molecules, and insulin signaling pathway genes after 30 days of the
  indicated drug treatment. (J and K) GSEA plots of gene sets related to AML (J) and
  the chemokine signaling pathway (K) after 30 days of the indicated drug treatment
