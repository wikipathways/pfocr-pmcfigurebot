figure_title: The nitrate signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana.
caption: 'The nitrate signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. At elevated nitrate
  levels, it leads to the activation of calcium−channel activity of the NRT1.1−CNGC15
  complex, resulting in a rapid nitrate−induced influx of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm.
  As cytosolic Ca2+ levels increase, the calcium−dependent kinases CPK10, CPK30, and
  CPK32 promote the phosphorylation of NLP7/NLP6. This triggers the nuclear translocation
  of NLPs. Meanwhile, NLP7 senses nitrate directly in the cytoplasm. Once nitrate
  binds to NLP7, it causes NLP7 to undergo a conformational change and to be transcriptionally
  derepressed. This occurs simultaneously and synergistically with the phosphorylation
  process. In the nucleus, NLP6 and NLP7 can bind directly to nitrate−responsive cis−elements
  (NRE) in the promoter regions of PNR genes and activate nitrate−responsive transcription.
