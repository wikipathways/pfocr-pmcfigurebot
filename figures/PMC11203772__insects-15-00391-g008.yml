caption: The spatiotemporal expression patterns of eight DEGs involved in the D. citri
  Hippo signaling pathway. (A) Relative expression level analysis of eight DEGs in
  different tissues of D. citri, namely, head, leg, wing, midgut, salivary gland,
  integument, testis, ovary, and fat body. (B) Relative expression level analysis
  of eight DEGs in different developmental stages of D. citri. The relative expression
  levels were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method. Statistical analysis was performed
  using the SPSS software. Different letters indicate significant differences, for
  example, a, b, c, and d (p < 0.05)
