caption: Knockdown of SHP2 expression eliminated ERK rebound after 48 h of vemurafenib
  treatment. A Analysis by western blotting within 48 h of 5 BRAF mutant thyroid cancer
  cell lines for activation of MAPK signaling pathway. B Cell viability detection
  by CCK-8 assay in 5 BRAF mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. C The cell cycle distribution
  detection by flow cytometric assay in 5 BRAF mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. 5
  BRAF mutant thyroid cancer cell lines were treated with DMSO, shSHP2, vemurafenib
  (5 μM) or shSHP2 + vemurafenib, respectively. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
  All data are expressed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments
