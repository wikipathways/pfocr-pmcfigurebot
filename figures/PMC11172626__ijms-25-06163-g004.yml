figure_title: The Western-blot analysis of SMAD proteins involved in signaling through
  the canonical TGF-β pathway was conducted in control (HMVEC_L) and case study (ICase)
  cultures, normalized against β-Actin, and treated with TGF-β (+) or not (−) (A).
caption: The Western-blot analysis of SMAD proteins involved in signaling through
  the canonical TGF-β pathway was conducted in control (HMVEC_L) and case study (ICase)
  cultures, normalized against β-Actin, and treated with TGF-β (+) or not (−) (A).
  (B) displays the activation status of the PI3K/MAPK pathway, as well as the levels
  of the mesenchymal marker Vimentin in both conditions (control and ICase). Additionally,
  γ tubulin was used as a loading control for all membranes in (B). Quantification
  of the band intensity is shown with the respective load-normalized ratios
