  activity and the HIF-1 signalling pathway.
caption: Expression levels of genes associated to the regulation of macrophage activity
  and the HIF-1 signalling pathway. (A) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis
  of the mRNA expression levels of genes regulating the macrophage activity signalling
  pathway and the HIF-1 signalling pathway in healthy controls and patients with IA.
  (B) The protein expression levels of IL4, ITGAM, MMP2 and RPL8 as well as a GAPDH
  control were determined through western blotting. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs. the control
  group (n=5). HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; Ctrl, control; IA, invasive aspergillosis
article_title: HIFâ€‘1 and macrophage activation signalling pathways are potential biomarkers
  of invasive aspergillosis
