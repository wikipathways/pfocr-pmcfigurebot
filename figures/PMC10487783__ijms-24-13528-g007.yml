figure_title: Effects of D3T on MAPK signaling pathway.
caption: 'Effects of D3T on MAPK signaling pathway. HaCaT Cells were co-treated with
  10 ng/mL TNF-α and different doses of D3T for 6 h. The expressions of total form
  and phospho form JNK, p38, and Erk1/2 were detected by Western blot. The band intensity
  was measured by image J (Java 1.8.0_345). The results were expressed as the mean
  ± SEM. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. Dex: Dexamethasone'
