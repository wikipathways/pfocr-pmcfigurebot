figure_title: Pathway analysis of the altered metabolites from the late preterms’
  urine with RDS versus healthy late preterms’ urine.
caption: 'Pathway analysis of the altered metabolites from the late preterms’ urine
  with RDS versus healthy late preterms’ urine. Metabolic data displaying metabolic
  pathways arranged by scores from pathway enrichment analysis (y axis) and from topology
  analysis (x axis). Each point represents a metabolic pathway. The color and size
  of each circle are based on p-values and pathway impact values, respectively. 8:
  Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; 9: Phenylalanine metabolism; 11: Cysteine and methionine
  metabolism; 12: D-Glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism; 13: Citrate cycle; 14: Butanoate
  metabolism; 16: Phosphatidylinositol signaling system; 17: Ascorbate and aldarate
  metabolism; 18: Valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; 21: Phenylalanine,
  tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; 22: Taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; 23:
  Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; 24: Glutathione metabolism; 25: Ubiquinone
  and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis; 26: Primary bile acid biosynthesis; 27:
  Purine metabolism; 28: Porphyrin metabolism; 29: Glycerophospholipid metabolism'
