caption: Network correlations from both study sites, demonstrating consistent networks
  between inferred functional metabolic pathways and bile acids in prebiotic diet
  groups. There were no consistent correlation networks present in the control diet
  groups between the study sites (A,B). The consistent correlation networks in the
  prebiotic diet groups (C) at NW and (D) at CU imply that the microbially modified
  secondary bile acid, deoxycholic acid, could be an important component underlying
  the beneficial effects of dietary prebiotics
