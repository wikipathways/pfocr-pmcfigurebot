caption: The extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The activation of the extrinsic
  pathway is initiated by the binding of ligands to receptors located on the plasma
  membrane. Upon activation of these receptors, the death-inducing signaling complex
  (DISC), composed of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase-8,
  is formed, activating caspase-8. Active caspase-8 then cleaves caspase-3, which
  cleaves downstream substrates, culminating in apoptosis. DNA damage activates the
  intrinsic pathway, leading to the activation of BH3-only proteins and allowing the
  oligomerization of BAX and BAK and the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from the
  mitochondria, following the mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).
  Cytosolic Cyt c forms a complex with apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (APAF-1)
  and caspase-9 called the apoptosome, resulting in the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3,
  and apoptosis. DNA damage can also induce PIDDosome assembly, a complex comprised
  of p53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD), RIP-associated ICH-1/CAD-3 homologous
  protein with a death domain (RAIDD), and caspase-2, resulting in caspase-2 activation.
  Once activated, caspase-2 cleaves the pro-apoptotic protein BID to tBID, inducing
  MOMP and apoptosis. Alternatively, the activation of caspase-8 by extrinsic signals
  can engage the activation of the intrinsic pathway by cleavage of BID.
