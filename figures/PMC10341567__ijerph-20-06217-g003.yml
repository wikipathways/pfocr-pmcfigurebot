  pathway and (B)PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway.'
caption: 'The major pathways and interactions regulated by GSK3B: (A) Wnt/B-catenin
  pathway and (B)PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway. In the Wnt/B-catenin pathway, the binding
  of Wnt to LRP causes the GSK3B complex with other proteins to be inhibited. This
  same complex phosphorylates the LRP/Wnt/ligand complex. The inhibited GSK3B complex
  stabilizes this pathway and causes the accumulation of B-catenin outside of the
  plasma membrane. B-catenin then translocates into the nucleus and forms a complex
  with the TCF/LEF transcription factors, which reduces transcription and DNA binding.
  In the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway, the binding of the growth factor to the receptor tyrosine
  kinase stimulates PI3K and PIP3 activity, which then stimulates Akt activity. This
  activation leads to the phosphorylation of GSK3B, which inactivates the protein.
  Once GSK3B is inhibited, the assembly of B-catenin is regulated for the Wnt signaling
  that is important to maintain synaptic signaling'
