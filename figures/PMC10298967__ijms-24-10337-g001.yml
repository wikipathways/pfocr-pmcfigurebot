figure_title: The core members of the NF-κB signaling pathway [22].
caption: 'The core members of the NF-κB signaling pathway [22]. (A) The protein structure
  of the core member of the NF-κB signaling; (B) the protein structure of the core
  member of the IκB family; (C) the protein structure of the core member of the IκB
  kinase (IKK) complex. Further abbreviations: N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD);
  ankyrin (ANK); C-terminal transactivation domains (TAs); leucine zipper-like motif
  (LZ); death domain (DD); helix–loop–helix domain (HLH); coiled-coil domain (CC);
  NEMO-binding domain (NBD); zinc finger domain (ZF)'
