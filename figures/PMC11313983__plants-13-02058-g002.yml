caption: Post-translational modifications of bZIP TFs. The left panel illustrates
  the acetylation of bZIP TFs mediated by histone acetyltransferases and the deacetylation
  of bZIP TFs by histone deacetylases. Specifically, OsbZIP46 deacetylation mediated
  by the histone deacetylase OsHDA716 reduces chilling tolerance through the interplay
  between the chromatin regulator and the bZIP TF. The right panel depicts the phosphorylation
  and ubiquitination of bZIP TFs. SnRK2s mediate the ABA key signaling pathway to
  control transcription and stomatal aperture modulation. SnRK2.2 is responsible for
  ABA-induced phosphorylation at the threonine (T) site, while Raf-like protein kinases,
  including ABA and the ARK, act as upstream regulators of the SnRK2. During ubiquitination,
  the HY5 in Arabidopsis interacts with COP1 through phosphorylation reactions, leading
  to proteasome-mediated degradation and the addition of ubiquitin molecules to HY5
