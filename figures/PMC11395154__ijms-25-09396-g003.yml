caption: 'The peroxisome pathway and expression profiles of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGS) involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis in leaves of
  both N192 and JI853 seedlings at the three-leaf stage under four treatments. NCKL:
  leaves of N192 seedlings treated with 0 μM 2,4-epibrassinolide (EBR) application
  at 25 °C normal temperature (CK); NCKEL: leaves of N192 seedlings treated with 2
  μM EBR application at 25 °C normal temperature (CKE); NLTL: leaves of N192 seedlings
  treated with 0 μM EBR application at 15 °C low-temperature (LT); NLTEL: leaves of
  N192 seedlings treated with 2 μM EBR application at 15 °C normal temperature (LTE);
  JCKL: leaves of Ji853 seedlings at CK; JCKEL: leaves of Ji853 seedlings at CKE;
  JLTL: leaves of Ji853 seedlings at LT; JLTEL: leaves of Ji853 seedlings at LTE.
  FPKM: the fragments per kilobase per million mapped. (A) Peroxisome pathway. (B)
  Expression profiles of DEGs in peroxisome pathway. (C) Expression profiles of DEGs
  for peroxidase in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway'
