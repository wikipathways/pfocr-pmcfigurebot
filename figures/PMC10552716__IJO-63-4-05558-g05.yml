  signaling pathway.
caption: 'NQO1/Snail regulates GBM progression by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway. (A) Correlations between NQO1 expression, and Snail, COL1A1, FN1 and TWIST2
  were analyzed using the ENCORI database. (B) Colocalization phenomena of NQO1 and
  Snail in GBM cells was confirmed using immunofluorescence analysis. Scale bar: 25
  μm. (C) Interaction of NQO1 and Snail protein in GBM cells was analyzed using co-IP.
  (D) T98G cells of the vector and NQO1 overexpression groups were treated with 10
  μM MG132 for 6 h. The ubiquitination of Snail was examined by western blotting.
  (E) Snail expression in GBM cells in the Vector group, and in those co-transfected
  with NQO1 and si-Con or siSnail (si #1, si #2 and si #3), as determined using western
  blotting. (F) Proliferation of T98G and SHG44 cells were measured by colony formation
  assay. Migration of cells was determined using (G) wound healing (scale bar: 50
  μm) and (H) Transwell assays (scale bar: 25 μm). (I) Expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition markers and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway markers were detected using western
  blotting. β-actin was used as the loading control. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone
