figure_title: Changes in cell junction protein expression levels after knocking down
  or inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway in E.
caption: Changes in cell junction protein expression levels after knocking down or
  inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway in E. sinensis testes. (A,A′) Western blotting
  results of α-catenin, β-catenin, ZO-1 and Pinin after injection with dsRNA against
  ERK compared with those after injection with dsRNA against GFP, and the data were
  analyzed by ImageJ2 and are showed in (A′). (B,B′) The expression level of junctional
  proteins after inhibiting ERK by U0126. (B′) shows the results analyzed by ImageJ2.
  (C,C′) The expression level of junctional proteins in the dsJNK group. The data
  were analyzed by ImageJ2, as shown in (C′). (D,D′) Western blotting and analysis
  of the results in the SP600125 group showed changes in junction protein levels compared
  with those in the DMSO group. (E,F) The expression levels of four kinds of cell
  junction proteins in the dsp38 MAPK and SB203580 groups compared with those in the
  dsGFP and DMSO groups. (E′,F′) are the results obtained via ImageJ2. * p < 0.05
  indicates a significant difference between two groups; ** p < 0.01 indicates an
  extremely significant difference; **** p < 0.0001 indicate an extremely significant
  difference. ‘ns’ indicates that there was no significant change
