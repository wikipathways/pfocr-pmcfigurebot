caption: The function enrichment and differentiation trajectory of fibroblast subpopulations
  (A) UMAP plot of the total fibroblast subsets. (B) UMAP plot showing the distribution
  of all fibroblasts in PCA, preca-OLK, OSCC. (C) UMAP plots showing the subpopulations
  of fibroblasts. (D) Heatmap showing representative GO pathways enrichment of the
  gene set expressed in fibroblasts subsets predicted by GSVA. (E) UMAP plot showing
  the differentiation trajectory of fibroblasts and the distribution of each cell
  subset on the trajectory
