caption: Results of metabolome analyses. (A,B) Partial least squares-discriminate
  analysis (PLS-DA) scores of metabolite sets in negative and positive ion modes for
  control versus heat stress plus vitamin C (A) and heat stress versus heat stress
  plus vitamin C (B). (C) Small molecule pathway database (SMPDB)-based enrichment
  analysis of metabolites with VIP score ≥ 1 (variable importance in the projection
  score) in both ion modes of control versus heat stress plus vitamin C. (D) SMPDB-based
  enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) with VIP score
  ≥ 1 in both ion modes of heat stress versus heat stress plus vitamin C. (E) Metabolite–metabolite
  interaction network analysis of all DEMs in negative ion mode. (F) All DEMs in positive
  ion mode are subjected to metabolite–metabolite interaction network analysis with
  circular nodes (bright red being the most central ones and purple being the less
  important) and lines joining the nodes referred to as edges
