caption: miR-196a promotes lipid accumulation in intramuscular preadipocytes by activating
  PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. (A,C) Detection of phospho-AKT (p-AKT-S473) and total
  AKT proteins abundances and ratio of p-Akt/Akt in miR-196a-overexpressing cells.
  (B,D) Detection of p-Akt and total Akt protein expression, and ratio of p-Akt/Akt
  in PI3K inhibitor (LY294002; PI3K)-treated and NC cells. (E) Lipid droplet content
  detection in miR-196a-overexpressing and control cells treated with PI3K inhibitor
  and NC by Oil Red O staining and quantification (day 2 after adipogenic differentiation;
  200×). (F) Bodipy staining and quantification were performed for lipid droplet content
  examination in miR-196a-overexpressing and control cells treated with PI3K inhibitor
  and NC (day 2 after adipogenic differentiation; 100×). The data are expressed as
  means ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
