figure_title: Metabolic pathway analysis of cancer cell lines reveals variations in
  the activity of pathways associated with growth media
caption: (A) Hierarchical clustering of relative activity scores for 73 significantly
  variable metabolic pathways across 21 chemically distinct growth media. A metabolic
  pathway activity score < 1 for a growth medium represents reduced pathway activity
  in that growth medium in comparison with the average pathway activity across all
  growth media; scores > 1 represent increased activity; and a score of 1 represents
  activity levels equivalent to the average over all growth media. (B) Ranking of
  metabolic pathways based on the extent to which their heterogeneity is associated
  with growth media, evaluated by computing the absolute sum of PCA loadings for each
  pathway over the first four principal components

  cancer contexts reveals synthetically lethal associations
