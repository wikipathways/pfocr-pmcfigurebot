caption: NCBP2 upregulates c-JUN to activate MEK/ERK signaling in a m7G-dependent
  manner. (A) KEGG analysis of RNA-seq data in PDAC patients with high or low NCBP2
  expression from TCGA cohort. (B) The GSEA enrichment plot of “MAPK signaling pathway”
  in PDAC patients with high or low NCBP2 expression from TCGA cohort. (C) Immunoblotting
  for protein levels of total JNK/phosphorylated JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), total p38/phosphorylated
  p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), and total ERK/phosphorylated ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) in control
  and NCBP2-knockdown PDAC cells. Tubulin was used as the internal control. (D) Immunoblotting
  for protein levels of total/phosphorylated MEK and total/phosphorylated ERK (Thr202/Tyr204)
  in control and c-JUN-knockdown Panc 05.04 and PANC-1 cells. Tubulin was used as
  the internal control. (E) The mRNA expression levels of NCBP2 and c-JUN in control
  and NCBP2-knockdown Panc 05.04 and PANC-1 cells. (F) Immunoblotting for protein
  levels of NCBP2 and c-JUN in control and NCBP2-knockdown Panc 05.04 and PANC-1 cells.
  Tubulin was used as the internal control. (G) Polysome profiling results of the
  control and NCBP2-knockdown Panc 05.04 and PANC-1 cells. (H) Gene-specific m7G qPCR
  results for the m7G methylation levels of c-JUN in PANC 05.04 and PANC-1 cells,
  *** p < 0.001
