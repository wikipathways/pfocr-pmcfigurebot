caption: A schematic illustration of leptin-induced signaling pathways. The binding
  of leptin to its receptor (ObR) leads to the formation of the ObR/JAK2 complex,
  which results in phosphorylation (P). This phosphorylation activates MAPK/ERK1/2
  signaling, PI3K/Akt, and downstream signals such as mTOR. Also, phosphorylated STAT3
  and STAT5 translocated to the nucleus activate target genes. This leptin-induced
  signaling pathway promotes cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and facilitates
  angiogenesis and migration
