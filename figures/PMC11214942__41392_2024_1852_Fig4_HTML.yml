caption: 'The cellular behavior mediated by the AKT pathway. The PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway significantly influences cell survival, proliferation, metabolism, and other
  cellular processes. Upon reception of external stimuli, various surface receptors
  (e.g., RTKs, ion channel receptors, G protein-coupled receptors) can activate and
  recruit PI3K to the plasma membrane, which then phosphorylates PIP2 into PIP3. PIP3
  subsequently recruits PDK1 to the cell membrane, leading to the phosphorylation
  and activation of Akt. This activation affects the expression or phosphorylation
  of downstream proteins (e.g., vimentin, p21, p27, Bax, etc.), ultimately influencing
  cellular outcomes, including apoptosis, migration, and proliferation, among others.
  Information is collected from published workâ€“,, and Cell Signaling Technology (https://www.cellsignal.cn/).
