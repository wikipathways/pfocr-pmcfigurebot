caption: 'Chronic kidney disease (CKD) transforms veins into an immune organ by upregulating
  13 cytokine and chemokine genes, 36 canonical secretome genes, 2 caspase-1-dependent
  and 5 caspase-4-dependent noncanonical secretome genes, and 28 exosome secretome
  genes. (A) A schematic diagram shows the canonical and noncanonical inflammatory
  caspase pathways and cytokine and chemokine secretion. (B) The gene expression changes
  of cytokines/cytokine receptors and chemokines in the veins of CKD patients compared
  to those of non-CKD controls. CKD significantly modulates the expression of 190
  cytokine/cytokine receptors and chemokine genes in veins. Among 190 CKD-modulated
  genes, 13 genes were significantly upregulated, and 177 genes were downregulated
  in the veins of CKD patients. The genes listed in Supplementary Table S1 were downregulated
  by CKD. (C) Metascape pathway analysis showed the top pathways of the 13 CKD-upregulated
  cytokine/cytokine receptors and chemokine genes. The 1249 cytokines/cytokine receptors
  and chemokines gene list was obtained from the HPA (https://www.proteinatlas.org/search/cytokine;
  https://www.proteinatlas.org/search/chemokine, accessed on 20 December 2022). (D)
  The gene expression changes of 2640 canonical secretomes (signal-peptide-mediated
  exocytic secretory pathway), 964 caspase-1-dependent noncanonical secretomes (nonsignal-peptide-mediated),
  1223 caspase-4-dependent noncanonical secretomes, and 6560 exosome secretomes in
  the veins of CKD patients compared to those of non-CKD controls. CKD significantly
  modulates the expression of 226 canonical secretome genes with 36 upregulated genes
  and 190 downregulated genes shown in Supplementary Table S2; 18 caspase-1-dependent
  noncanonical secretomes with two upregulated genes and 16 downregulated genes shown
  in Supplementary Table S3; 56 caspase-4-dependent noncanonical secretomes with 5
  upregulated genes and 51 downregulated genes shown in Supplementary Table S4, and
  144 exosome secretomes with 28 upregulated genes and 116 downregulated genes shown
  in Supplementary Table S5. The 2640 canonical secretome gene list was downloaded
  from the HPA (https://www.proteinatlas.org, accessed on 20 December 2022), 964 noncanonical
  caspase-1-dependent noncanonical secretome gene list was generated from PMID: 18329368,
  1223 noncanonical caspase-4-dependent noncanonical secretome gene list was extracted
  from PMID: 28196878, and 6560 exosome secretome gene list was downloaded from a
  comprehensive exosome database (http://www.exocarta.org, accessed on 20 December
  2022). (E) Metascape pathway analysis showed the top pathways of the 36 CKD-upregulated
  canonical secretome genes. (F) Metascape pathway analysis showed the top pathways
  of the 28 CKD-upregulated exosome secretome genes. (G) A summary of CKD differentially
  expressed canonical, caspase-1-dependent, caspase-4-dependent, and exosome secretome
  genes. (H) A schematic diagram shows that in a CKD environment, the vein has an
  endocrine function to secrete cytokines/chemokines and secretomes, which have effects
  on the physiological and pathological functions of the kidney (CKD) and other tissues
  and organs'
