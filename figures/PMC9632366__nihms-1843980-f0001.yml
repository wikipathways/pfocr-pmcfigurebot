caption: 'Proposed Mechanisms of Action of Acetylsalicylic Acid on the Phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase Pathway.Lymphatic malformations are caused by somatic mutations in PIK3CA
  that lead to constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway. PI3K is a heterodimer
  comprised of the p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit, encoded by PIK3CA.
  The pathway is activated by signaling through the growth factor receptor tyrosine
  kinase on the cell membrane, which bind to and activate PI3K. PI3K is an enzyme
  that converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3) leading to the activation of AKT by phosphorylation. Then AKT, TSC1/2 and
  mTORC1 signaling mediate gene expression leading to the downstream effects of this
  pathway. Therapeutic targets in the pathway are illustrated in red.Adapted from:
