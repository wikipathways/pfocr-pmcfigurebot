caption: Molecular mechanisms underlying hyperglycemic effects of As exposure. As
  exposure was shown to induce β-cell dysfunction and death through ferroptosis, resulting
  in reduced insulin production. Alteration of IR/IRS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway upon
  As exposure was shown to inhibit insulin signaling, thus resulting in insulin resistance.
  As-induced ROS overproduction was also shown to promote NF-κB and MAPK activation
  with subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation and gasdermin D-dependent pyroptosis
  that is considered as a potential player in the development of both insulin resistance
  and insulin deficiency. Activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress upon As
  exposure also promote inflammasome activation. In addition, recent findings demonstrated
  that that As-induced β-cell dysfunction may be mediated by up-regulation of miR-29a,
  miR-146, and miR-209 expression. The effects of the latter are at least partially
  associated with inhibition of transcriptional factor PDX1 expression. In addition,
  metalloid-induced miR-191 up-regulation significantly contributes to inhibition
  of IRS1/PI3K/Akt pathway. Different colors (pink, grey, blue, yellow) are indicative
  of distinct pathways for better visualization. Red and blue arrows show the increase
  and decrease effects
