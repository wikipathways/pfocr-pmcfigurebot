figure_title: PC61 binding to CD25 activates Treg integrins via an alternative signaling
  pathway
caption: (A) Binding of soluble MAdCAM-1 to CD4 T cells treated in the presence or
  absence of inhibitory anti-IL-2 receptor β (TMB1) with PC61 (5 μg/mL), IL-2 (2.5
  μg/mL), or PMA (100 nM). GFP+ Tregs were analyzed. Data represent mean ± SEM (n
  = 6). One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. NS, not significant; ***p < 0.001.(B)
  STAT5 phosphorylation of CD4 T cells in the presence of PC61 (5 μg/mL) or IL-2 (2.5
  μg/mL). GFP+ Tregs were analyzed. Data are representative of at least three independent
  experiments.(C) STAT5 phosphorylation response of GFP+ Tregs to IL-2 in the presence
  or absence of 100 nM baricitinib. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 6).(D) Binding
  of soluble MAdCAM-1 to GFP+ Tregs treated with 5 μg/mL control IgG (−) or PC61.
  The addition of 100 nM baricitinib did not significantly affect the response to
  PC61. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 9). One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.
  NS, not significant.(E) Binding of soluble MAdCAM-1 to CD4 T cells treated with
  indicated inhibitors in the presence of PC61 (5 μg/mL) or IgG control. GFP+ Tregs
  were analyzed. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 6). One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
  post-test.(F) Binding of soluble MAdCAM-1 to CD4 T cells treated with pertussis
  toxin (PTX) (100 nM) or vehicle in the presence of PC61 (5 μg/mL), CXCL12 (1 μg/mL),
  or PMA (100 nM). GFP+ Tregs were analyzed. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 6). One-way
  ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.(G) The key signaling events that occur downstream
  of GPCR signaling that lead to integrin activation.(H) PTX blocks PC61 enhancement
  of Tregs’ suppressive activity. Tregs isolated from CD45.2 congenic Foxp3GFP mice
  were mixed with responder cells at the indicated Treg/responder cell ratios in the
  presence of PC61 (5 μg/mL), PTX (100 nM), or PC61 together with PTX. Responder cells
  were CFSE-labeled CD45.1 congenic C57BL/6 CD4+CD25− naive T cells activated by anti-CD3
  (5 μg/mL), anti-CD28 (5 μg/mL), and IL-2 (6 ng/mL). CFSE populations gated on CD45.1+
  cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on day 5 to determine the division index using
  FlowJo software. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 4). Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
  post-test. NS, not significant; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
