figure_title: Pathogenic mutations in ASXL1 cause tissue-specific and tissue-independent
  effects on gene expression
caption: (A) RNA-seq raw read counts for the ASXL1 reference allele (black) and pathogenic
  allele (white, with black outline) at each BOS patient’s respective mutation in
  blood (n = 8) and (B) fibroblast (n = 7) samples. (C) RNA-seq heatmap of all significant
  DEGs with Padj < 0.05 and abs(log2FC) ≥ 0.58 between BOS (blue, n = 8) and control
  (pink, n = 11) blood found 1097 DEGs, with 590 of 1097 (53.8%) being more upregulated
  and (D) 155 DEGs between BOS (n = 7) and control (n = 7) fibroblasts, with 125 of
  155 DEGs (80.6%) being more upregulated in BOS patients. (E) Blood RNA-seq gene
  ontology highlighted enrichment of genes related to nervous system development and
  canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (F) Fibroblast RNA-seq gene ontology highlighted
  enrichment of genes related to nervous system development. (G) Volcano plots for
  BOS compared to control RNA-seq in blood (x axis) and fibroblast (y axis) identified
  a core subset of 25 shared dysregulated transcripts, with 21 of 25 DEGs (84%) dysregulated
  in the same direction
