caption: Pathway analysis of transcriptomic data reveals an enhanced antiviral phenotype
  in C5aR2 KO THP-1 cell lines compared to WT. (A) Unique, genotype-dependent, treatment-dependent
  significantly regulated genes (p ≤ 0.05, log2FC < ±1) were identified. (B) An unbiased
  cluster analysis and pathway analysis was performed using STRING, and the significantly
  enriched pathways were highlighted in red (Cytokine-Cytokine Receptor Interaction)
  or blue (JAK-STAT Signalling Pathway) (Supplementary Figures S6–S9). (C) An unbiased
  pathway analysis was performed using PANTHER and GO Biological Process gene sets.
  Red text highlights relevant anti-viral pathways (D) Significantly regulated KEGG
  gene sets from the GSEA were manually triaged, selecting for unique pathways for
  each condition, genotype-specific stimulation-independent pathways, or genotype-independent
  stimulation-independent pathways, filtering out stimulation-specific genotype-independent
  pathways, or pathways common to all conditions. Significantly regulated inflammatory
  pathways from the C5aR2 KO vs. wild-type comparison (C5a or STING agonist-treated)
  were manually curated. Selected genes from KEGG gene sets were marked in a volcano
  plot for STING agonist-treated C5aR2 KO cells vs. STING agonist-treated wild-type
