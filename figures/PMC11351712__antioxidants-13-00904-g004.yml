figure_title: Shh gene overexpression activates the Hh signaling pathway and enhances
  vascular function in endothelial cells.
caption: Shh gene overexpression activates the Hh signaling pathway and enhances vascular
  function in endothelial cells. (A,B) The protein expression level of Shh in the
  HUVECs in each group was detected by Western blotting, n = 3. (C) A CCK-8 assay
  revealed that Shh gene overexpression alleviated the inhibitory effect of IR on
  endothelial cell proliferation. n = 3, * p < 0.05. (D,E) Western blot and immunofluorescence
  staining results revealed that the Hh signaling pathway was significantly inhibited
  at 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IR. Furthermore, overexpression of the Shh gene was
  observed to activate the Hh signaling pathway and upregulate Gli1 expression. (F)
  IF staining revealed that compared with that in the blank group, VEGF expression
  in the IR and IR+NC groups was significantly lower at 4 h and 48 h after IR, whereas
  VEGF expression in the IR+Shh group was greater than that in the control group.
  Scale = 50 μm. (G–I) Western blot results and subsequent quantitative analysis revealed
  that overexpression of the Shh gene promoted the expression of CD31 and VEGF and
  restored vascular function in endothelial cells; n = 3, * p < 0.05. The data are
  shown as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM); ns (not significant), * (p
  < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01) and *** (p < 0.001) indicate significant differences
