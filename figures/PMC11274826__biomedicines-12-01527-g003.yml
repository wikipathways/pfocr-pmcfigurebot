caption: Role of OPN in the regulation of various signaling pathways. OPN through
  its interaction with αvβ3, α4β1, α3β2 and α9β1 integrins and the CD44 receptor transduces
  multiple signaling pathways and their crosstalks such as FAK/MEK/ERK, PLCγ/PKC/PI3K/Akt/mTOR,
  NIK/IκBα/NFκB, JAK/STAT3, PI3K/Akt/β-catenin, NFκB/HIF1α/BMI1, c-Src/EGFR/MEK/ERK
  and MAPK pathways. These signaling cascades induce the activation of various tumor-promoting
  genes such as VEGF, MMPs and COX-2, thereby inducing tumor growth at the primary
  sites, angiogenesis, metastases at the distance sites, ECM remodeling, immune suppression,
  stemness, immune evasion, chemoresistance, migration and survival
