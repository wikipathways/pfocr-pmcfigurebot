caption: (a) The results for the heatmaps of gelsenicine and the 15 upstream biosynthetic
  pathway genes associated with it under SA treatment; (b) the results for the heatmaps
  of gelsenicine and the 15 upstream biosynthetic pathway genes associated with it
  under MeJA treatment; (c) the results for the heatmaps of gelsenicine and the 15
  upstream biosynthetic pathway genes associated with it under ETH treatment; (d)
  the results for the heatmaps of gelsenicine and the 15 upstream biosynthetic pathway
  genes associated with it under ABA treatment. The darker the colors, the stronger
  is the correlation
