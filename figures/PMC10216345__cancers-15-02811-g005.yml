figure_title: Fibrosis-associated proteins in CCK-BR signaling pathway in mPSCs by
  western immunoblotting.
caption: Fibrosis-associated proteins in CCK-BR signaling pathway in mPSCs by western
  immunoblotting. (A) Diagram of mature collagen and precursor collagen protein with
  size (Reprinted and adapted with permission from Iannarone et al. [54]). (B) Western
  blot of protein lysates of mPSCs treated with CCK, proglumide, the combination of
  CCK and proglumide, the selective CCK-AR antagonist (L364,718), and the selective
  CCK-BR antagonist (L365,260) probed with a polyclonal antibody for Col1α1 and normalized
  with β-Actin. The gel shows bands present for pro-collagen1α1 (top), mature collagen1α1
  (middle), and collagen-1α1 cleavage products (bottom). Note this gel was run on
  two separate apparatuses due to the large number of wells required, and the gels
  are fused for appearance. (C) Densitometry normalized to β-Actin of the Pro-collagen1α1
  ratio expression was significantly decreased in the proglumide (p < 0.00001), combination
  (p = 0.009), and CCK-BR antagonist (p < 0.02) compared to control. (D) Densitometry
  of the gel bands for mature collagen shows that protein expression was significantly
  decreased by treatment of the mPSCs with proglumide (p < 0.005). (E) Collagen-1α1
  cleavage products were significantly increased by CCK, proglumide, and the combination
  of CCK and proglumide. (F) Western blot of mPSC protein lysates reacted with αSMA
  antibody and normalized to β-tubulin. Note this gel was run on two separate apparatuses
  due to the large number of wells required, and the gels are fused for appearance.
  (G) Columns represent means ± SEM of densitometry ratios (n = 3). Significant change
  in αSMA protein expression was seen in proglumide-treated mPSCs. Significantly different
  from controls * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.005; and **** p < 0.0001. The original
  western blot figures could be found in Figure S6
