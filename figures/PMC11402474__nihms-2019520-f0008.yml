figure_title: CRTC affects cardiac function in hiPSC-cardiomyocytes
caption: (A) Representative voltage traces from control siRNA- and siCRTC-transfected
  cardiomyocytes. APs were recorded optically from individual cardiomyocytes. APD
  at 75% of repolarization (APD75) was significantly increased with siRNA-mediated
  KD of CRTC2 and CRTC3. (Plots show max, min, median, and p values; siCtrl n = 1,338,
  siCRTC1 n = 1,459, siCRTC2 n = 1,427, siCRTC3 n = 1,326; significance by one-way
  ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons post hoc test).(B) RT-qPCR quantification
  showing reduction in SRL expression in iPSC-CMs after siRNA CRTC KD. (Significance
  by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons post hoc test).(C) siRNA KD of
  SRL prolongs APD75 in hiPSC-CMs (unpaired t test).(D) Model of proposed CaN-CRTC-SRL
  signaling pathway
