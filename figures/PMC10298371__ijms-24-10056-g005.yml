caption: NS1 inhibits the MDA5-CARD-regulated pathway. MYC-MDA5-CARD was transiently
  cotransfected with p3xFLAG-NS1 or p3xFLAG (2.5 µg/well) into MDCK cells. The relative
  mRNA expression levels of (A) RLR (LGP2 and RIG-I), (B) antiviral molecules (IPS1,
  Mx, OAS, and STAT1), and (C) proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-β, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6,
  and IL-8) in MDCK cells were determined by RT-qPCR after 36 h of transfection. The
  data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc correction for multiple comparisons
  with Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) method. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001; ns p > 0.05. Error bars indicate the mean (±SD)
  of 3 independent experiments. (D) The protein expression of TRIM25, RIG-I, and STAT1
  was analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. NS1 expression was
  detected with an anti-Flag antibody, and Tubulin was used as a loading control
