caption: 'Anatomic and functional organization of the vestibular system. The vestibular
  nerve is in contact with the sensory hair cells located in the peripheral vestibular
  system. This nerve projects ipsilaterally to the four vestibular nuclei (VNs): superior,
  lateral, medial and inferior, located in the brainstem. From these nuclei, several
  output pathways exist. The vestibulo-oculomotor pathway originates from the lateral
  nuclei that project to the oculomotor nuclei via the medial longitudinal fasciculus
  (MLF), allowing the stabilization of gaze during head movements. The vestibulospinal
  pathway includes a lateral vestibulospinal fasciculus (LVSF) that connects the ipsilateral
  lateral VN to the spinal cord and a medial vestibulospinal fasciculus (MVSF) that
  connects the contralateral medial, inferior, and lateral VNs to the musculature
  of the neck and upper body axis. This organization establishes postural control
  and muscle tone. The vestibulo-vegetative pathway consists of the superior and medial
  VNs that activate the vagus nerve, responsible for vital functions. VNs are linked
  to several neurovegetative nuclei, such as the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve
  (DNV), solitary nucleus (NTS) and area postrema. Various vestibulo-cortical pathways
  originate from all VNs and project bilaterally to the cortex. The diversity of output
  from the VNs underlines the broad role of the vestibular system in posturo-locomotor,
  oculomotor and higher cognitive functions. The balanced resting activity between
  the bilateral VNs is crucial for these functions. Created with bioRender'
