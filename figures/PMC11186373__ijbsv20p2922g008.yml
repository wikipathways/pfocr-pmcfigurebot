figure_title: Sodium chloride promotes macrophage pyroptosis and aggravates rheumatoid
  arthritis by activating SGK1 through GABA receptors Slc6a12
caption: 'Schematic illustration of high salt diet promoting RA progression: high
  concentration of sodium ions enters into macrophages in synovial tissues through
  the sodium ion transporter Slc6a12, which activates SGK1 by promoting phosphorylation
  of SGK1, followed by the production of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β
  and IL-18 by promoting classical pyroptosis pathway through the MAPK p38 and NF-κB
  p65 signaling pathways, which aggravates the synovial inflammation'
