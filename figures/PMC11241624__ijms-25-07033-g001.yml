caption: 'The involvement of PTP1B in pathogenesis of human diseases. Caption: Activation
  of signaling pathway related to Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which is initiated by the
  binding of leptin to its receptor (LEPR), results in regulation of energy expenditure
  homeostasis, as well as hunger adjustment. The latter results from the induction
  of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which mediates the
  target gene transcription. Moreover, this pathway is critical in preventing the
  onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through the inhibition of amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation
  (prevention of amyloid plaques formation), and inhibition of tau protein (TAU) phosphorylation.
  Both factors were previously recognized as direct risk factors of AD, and as markers
  of cognitive function deterioration. Furthermore, the activation of JAK2 is responsible
  for the induction of the signaling pathway initiated by insulin receptor (IR) activation,
  which is also known as the insulin receptor substrate/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B (IRS/PI3K/AKT) pathway. The activation of the IRS/PI3K/AKT pathway leads
  to the suppression of the forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), which results in the
  inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Moreover, the activation of the IRS/PI3K/AKT pathway
  inhibits glycogenesis by the suppression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and
  determines cognitive function by regulating the survival and neuroplasticity of
  neurons. This pathway is also related to the cascade initiated by the activation
  of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), by the direct or indirect activation of
  the rat sarcoma virus (G protein)/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase(s) (RAS/RAF)
  pathway. The RAS/RAF pathway is responsible for cell growth, survival, and neuroplasticity;
  along with phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCγ1) activation resulting in the expression
  of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase(s) (CAMK) and protein kinase C (PKC),
  which are also responsible for neuroplasticity. The activation of toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), plays a dual role in the pathogenesis
  of fatty liver disease. On one hand, the accumulation of LPSs promotes the synthesis
  of proinflammatory cytokines induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other,
  by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, PTP1B prevents the release of proinflammatory
  cytokines from macrophages related to the TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  interferon-beta (TRIF) and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 protein (MyD88)'
