caption: 'CCL2 promoted MAP3K19 expression through the MEK/ERK pathway. (A) Ten representative
  signaling pathways were upregulated by CCL2 in the A2780 cells. (B) The protein
  levels of p-MEK, MEK, p-ERK, ERK, MAP3K19, and actin were analyzed using Western
  blotting in the A2780 and CCL2-overexpressing A2780 cells. (C) The expressions of
  phosphorylated MEK, phosphorylated ERK, MAP3K19, MEK, ERK, and actin were analyzed
  using Western blotting in the A2780 and CCL2-knockout A2780 cells. (D) The expressions
  of phosphorylated MEK, phosphorylated ERK, MAP3K19, MEK, ERK, and actin were analyzed
  using Western blotting in the following cells: A2780, CCL2-overexpressing A2780,
  CCL2-overexpressing A2780 pretreated with PD98059, and CCL2-overexpressing A2780
  pretreated with RS504393. (E) Representative photographs of the migration (left)
  and invasion (right) abilities of the following cells: CCL2-overexpressing A2780,
  CCL2-overexpressing A2780 pretreated with PD98059, and CCL2-overexpressing A2780
  pretreated with RS504393 (n = 3). (F) Statistical analysis of (left side of (F)).
  (G) Statistical analysis of (right side of (F)). (H) PD98059 and RS504393 inhibited
  the A2780-CCL2 cell proliferation. Scale bars: 50 Î¼m. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001'
