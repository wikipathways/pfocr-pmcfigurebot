caption: 'A) An overview of the retinal organoid differentiation protocol and treatment
  timing. On Day 6, BMP4 was added to the cultures. BMP4 was diluted in half on Day
  8 and again on Day 10 before being removed completely on Day 12. SAG, SU5402, and/or
  CHIR were added on Day 14â€“18. The organoids were cultured for an additional 10 days
  before collection. B) A summary of the seven treatments performed in this experiment.
  Note that the All, BMP, CHIR, SU5402, and SU5402:CHIR treatments include BMP4. C)
  A box plot of the number of cells recovered per organoid for each treatment. The
  number above the boxplot indicates the number of individual organoids in which >
  50 cells were recovered for that treatment. D) Dot plot of the genes used to define
  cell types for D28 organoids. The size of the dot indicates the percent of cells
  that express the gene of interest. The color indicates the log10 mean UMIs per cell.
  E) Left: UMAP generated by Monocle3 of the recovered cells with cell type annotations
  from D28 organoids treated with signaling modulators. Right: For each of the UMAPs
  only the cells from the specified treatment are colored by treatment. RPC_OV: retinal
  progenitor cell/optic vesicle, RPE: retinal pigmented epithelium, OS: optic stalk,
  RP: roof plate, FP: floor plate. F) A stacked bar plot in which the mean cell type
  composition of the D28 organoids are displayed for each treatment. G) Violin plots
  of size-factor normalized cell counts for each cell type from D28 organoids. Plots
  are colored by treatment'
