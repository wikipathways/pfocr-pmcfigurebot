caption: Z-scores and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of differences
  in metabolites among different groups. (A–C) Z-score analysis of relative quantification
  values of metabolites on the same horizontal plane between different groups, Z-score
  values on the horizontal axis, and differential metabolites on the vertical axis.
  Only the top 30 metabolites (in descending order of P-values) are shown in the figure.
  (D–F) KEGG analysis of pathways enriched in differential metabolites between different
  groups. Pathway enrichment can determine the main biochemical metabolic and signal
  transduction pathways involved in differential metabolites. The horizontal axis
  in the figure is x/y (the number of differential metabolites in the corresponding
  metabolic pathway/the total number of metabolites identified in the pathway), and
  the larger the value, the higher the enrichment level of differential metabolites
  in the pathway. The colour of the dot represents the P-value value of the hypergeometric
  test, and the smaller the value, the greater the reliability and statistical significance
  of the test. The size of the point represents the number of differential metabolites
  in the corresponding pathway, and the larger the point, the more differential metabolites
  in the pathway.
