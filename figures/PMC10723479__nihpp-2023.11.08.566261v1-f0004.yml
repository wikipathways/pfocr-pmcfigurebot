figure_title: Loss of proper Scd1 localization is caused by Pak1 stabilizing
caption: A. Scd1-mNG localization in pak1+ and pak1-ts mutant cells. Blue asterisks
  depict bipolar Scd1-mNG localization. B. Quantification of Scd1-mNG intensities
  at the cell ends in pak1+ and pak1-ts cells treated with DMSO and CK-666. Colors
  represent each replicate by day. Large circles are the means of each experimental
  replicate (n ≥ 10 cells). C. (i) Model3 incorporates feedback loops involving Cdc42-GTP,
  Cdc42-GDP, GEF (Scd1), Pak1, and endocytosis, and an additional negative signaling
  pathway inhibiting Cdc42-GTP. (ii) Left panel shows Model3 simulations, and the
  right panel shows simulations with decreased removal rate of Pak1. D. Model3 simulations
  with an additional negative signaling pathway simulated via decreased removal rate
  of Cdc42 and Scd1. Scale bar, 10µm. p-value, *<0.05, ***<0.0003, One way ANOVA,
  followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test
