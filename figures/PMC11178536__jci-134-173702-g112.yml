figure_title: Rescue of genes implicated in gluconeogenesis and drug metabolism and
  critical proteins involved in mitochondrial electron transport chain and fatty acid
  oxidation with SMN repletion in day 24 SMA type 1 iHeps
caption: (A) RT-qPCR of gluconeogenesis pathway genes. For G6Pase, one outlier from
  isogenic (Iso) carrier and 1 outlier from 1-38G was removed using the ROUT test
  with a maximum FDR of 1%. (B) RT-qPCR of iHep function genes. For ASGR2, one outlier
  from 1-38G was removed. For F2, one outlier from Iso WT was removed. For SERPINA1,
  one outlier from 1-38G was removed. (C) RT-qPCR of drug metabolism genes. For FMO3,
  one outlier from Iso carriers was removed. (A–C) For all RT-qPCR, fold change results
  were derived using the comparative ΔΔCt method. Data are from 3 to 4 independent
  experiments. Unless specifically indicated that outliers were removed, analysis
  of data from 3 independent experiments included 9 samples (n = 9) each for WT, Iso
  WT, and Iso carrier conditions. Similarly for analysis of data from 4 independent
  experiments, n = 12 for each condition. For 1-38G, n ≥ 4 for all experiments. (D)
  Flow cytometric analysis of critical proteins involved in mitochondrial electron
  transport chain (SDHB and MT-CO1) and fatty acid oxidation (HADHA) with correlation
  to SMN protein expression. MFI was obtained by recording 10,000 events and viable
  iHeps were then gated for. Data are from 2 to 3 independent experiments. Analysis
  of data from 2 independent experiments included 9 samples (n = 6) each for WT, Iso
  WT, and Iso carrier conditions. Similarly for analysis of data from 3 independent
  experiments, n = 9 for each condition. For 1-38G, n ≥ 4 for all experiments. In
  A–D, data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test
  and are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001
