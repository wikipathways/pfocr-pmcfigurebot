caption: GEM treatment acutely upregulates genes associated with immune pathways in
  triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors. Bulk RNA-seq was performed on 4T1 tumors
  24 h and 7 days post systemic (I.P.) injection of GEM (1.2 mg) or saline vehicle
  control. (A,B). Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes in 4T1 tumors from
  GEM treated and saline treated mice 24 h (A) and 7 days (B) post injection. (C,D).
  Gene ontology analysis showing normalized enrichment scores for the top 20 hallmark
  pathways modulated in the GEM cohort compared to the control saline cohort 24 h
  (C) and 7 days (D) post injection. (E). Gene seat enrichment analysis for the “INTERFERON
  GAMMA RESPONSE” pathway upregulated 24 h after GEM administration
