caption: Pharmacological antagonism of PI3K signalling attenuates cellular senescence
  in canine aVICs. aVICs were exposed to DMSO (Control), 60 μM LY294002, 5 μM copanlisib
  and 50 μM alpelisib treatment for 24 h. (A, B) Representative images of SA‐β‐gal
  (blue) staining and quantitative analysis of the percentage of SA‐β‐gal positive
  cells, scale bar 50 μm (n = 12 microscopic fields/treatment). (C, D) Representative
  confocal images of γ‐H2AX (green) immunostaining in nuclei and quantitative analysis
  of the number of γ‐H2AX puncta, scale bar 20 μm (n = 50 cells/treatment). (E) Representative
  western blot of p16INK4A, p21CIP1, p53 and β‐actin protein expression and (F–H)
  quantification of the relative protein expression (n = 6). (I) Quantitative RT‐PCR
  for SASP cytokine expression in aVICs exposed to DMSO and PI3K inhibitors (n = 6).
  (J–L) Quantification of secreted TGF‐β1, IL‐6 and MMP‐9 in collected supernatant
  from aVIC cultures (n = 6). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA followed
  by Tukey's range test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to control.
  ANOVA, analysis of variance; aVIC, activated myofibroblast phenotype; SASP, senescent‐associated
  secretory phenotype.

  and secretory phenotype of valvular interstitial cells through the modulation of
  cellular senescence in a naturally occurring in vitro canine model of myxomatous
  mitral valve disease.
