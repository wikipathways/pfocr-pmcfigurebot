  pathway relationships
caption: (a) Heatmaps representing Pearson’s correlation between gene profiles after
  hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method. The ribosomal gene complex was enriched
  in the DMEM HeLa dataset based on the preranked GSEA analysis. Different subset
  of ribosomal genes enriched in certain clusters are highlighted in the heatmap.
  Ribosome image created with Biorender. (b) Heatmaps representing Pearson’s correlation
  between gene profiles after hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method. The genes
  associated with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were enriched in the DMEM HeLa dataset
  based on the preranked GSEA analysis. The table on the right highlights the genes
  with activatory/inhibitory effects in accordance with the correlation/anti-correlation
  between profiles from the heatmap
