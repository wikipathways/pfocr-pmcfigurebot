caption: 'Pathway for oxidation of tyrosine to HT (adapted from Chen et al. [44]).
  (a) Highly efficient mutant enzymes HpaBC and TYO were obtained by protein engineering,
  which sequentially lifted the two rate-limiting steps in the original HT synthesis
  pathway and increased the HT synthesis capacity of the original synthesis pathway
  (conversion rate greater than 90%). (b) L-tyrosine oxidation is catalyzed by tyrosine
  hydroxylase (TH) in the presence of the pterin cofactor (conversion rate less than
  20%). DODC: L-DOPA decarboxylase; TYO: tyramine oxidase; ADH: alcohol dehydrogenase;
  3,4-DHPAA: 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde'
