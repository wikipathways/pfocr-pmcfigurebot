caption: 'SOCS1 inhibits the IFNγ-driven JAK-STAT pathway. (A) SOCS1 negatively regulates
  IFNγ signaling. Upon engagement with the IFNGR complex, IFNγ induces tyrosine-phosphorylation
  and activation of JAK1 and JAK2. Activated JAK1/2 phosphorylate intracellular Tyr
  motifs in the IFNGR1, leading to STAT1 recruitment via the STAT1-SH2 domain and
  its subsequent phosphorylation by JAK. pSTAT1 dimers undergo a conformation change
  and translocate to the nucleus, binding to gamma interferon activation sites (GAS)
  to regulate transcription and drive a cellular response. SOCS1 is an IFNγ-response
  gene and is induced to inhibit IFNγ signaling in a classic negative feedback loop.
  pY = phosphotyrosine; TTCNNNGAA = IFNγ-activated promoter sequences. (B) SOCS domain
  architecture. The SOCS domain architecture consists of an unstructured N-terminal
  region of variable length (teal), a central SH2 domain (blue) and a C-terminal SOCS
  box motif (purple). SOCS1 and SOCS3 are distinguished by a KIR that precedes the
  ESS and SH2 domain region. The CIS and SOCS3 SH2 domains contain a PEST insertion
  (grey), while SOCS1 contains a putative NLS. (C) SOCS1 inhibition of JAK. Non-canonical
  binding of the SOCS1-SH2 domain (blue) to the JAK-GQM motif (pink), enables blocking
  of JAK-enzymatic activity via the SOCS1-KIR (orange). PDB: 6C7Y (). SH2, Src-Homology
  2 domain; ESS, Extended SH2 Sequence; KIR, Kinase Inhibitory Region; PEST, sequence
  rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T); NLS*, nuclear
  localisation signal.'
