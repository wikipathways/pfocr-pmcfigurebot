figure_title: NE+EV-mediated activation of ERK1/2 pathway in LX2 cells depends on
  NE
caption: (A) Western blot analysis showed incubation of LX2 cells with Sivelestat,
  a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, before treatment with NE+EV results in the reduction
  of the phosphorylated ERK1/2 and MEK proteins in LX2 cells as mediated by NE+EV.
  (B) The band intensity quantification of p-ERK and (C) p-MEK indicated significant
  decrease in the p-ERK and p-MEK signal when NE on the surface of EV was inhibited
  using Sivelestat treatment in LX2 cells, indicating the role of EV-associated NE
  in activating LX2 cells via activation of ERK1/2 pathway
