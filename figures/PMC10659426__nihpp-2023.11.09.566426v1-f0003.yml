figure_title: Azin1 A-to-I locked state limits kidney injury by upregulating polyamines
  and other protective pathways
caption: (A) Sanger sequencing chromatograms for wild-type (top), Azin1 A-to-I uneditable
  (middle), and Azin1 A-to-I locked homozygous mice (bottom). The CRISPR knock-in
  strategy is depicted in Supplemental Figure 4A. (B) Serum creatinine levels 24 hours
  after a 20-minute bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury. (C) Polyribosome profiling
  of kidneys from Azin1 A-to-I locked and uneditable mice 24 hours after ischemia-reperfusion
  injury. Two representative biological replicates are shown for each genotype. Mean
  polysome-to-monosome ratios for A-to-I locked and uneditable genotypes are 3.3 and
  2.8, respectively. (D) Western blotting for hypusine in the kidney after ischemia-reperfusion
  injury. (E) Volcano plot showing the top two differentially expressed metabolites.
  The x-axis depicts the log2 fold change of A-to-I locked-to-uneditable ratio, and
  the y-axis depicts âˆ’log10 adjusted p values. Global untargeted metabolomics, n=5
  for each condition. (F) Heatmap displaying the top differentially expressed metabolites
  between Azin1 locked and uneditable mice after ischemia-reperfusion injury (adjusted
  p < 0.05 for all listed metabolites). (G) Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially
  expressed metabolites between Azin1 A-to-I locked and uneditable mouse kidneys after
  ischemia-reperfusion injury. (H) Metabolite ratios (log2 fold change of A-to-I locked-to-uneditable)
  mapped to the polyamine pathway and pseudo-colored according to the indicated scale.
  Metabolites with blank circles were not resolved by the metabolomics. (I) Metabolite
  ratios mapped to the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway
