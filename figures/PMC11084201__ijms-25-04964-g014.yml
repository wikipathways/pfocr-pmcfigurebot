caption: 'Metabolic pathway analysis of the endogenous metabolites in liver tissue.
  (A) Comparison between the vehicle- and MP-treated groups of WT mice. (B) Comparison
  between the vehicle- and MP-treated groups of Lep KO mice. The changes from yellow
  to red and from small to large circles indicate the amino acid metabolism pathways
  that showed a large response to MP administration. Abbreviations: WT; wild type,
  Lep KO; leptin knockout, MPs; microplastics'
