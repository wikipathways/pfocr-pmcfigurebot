figure_title: Enrichment map of metabolic pathways.
caption: Enrichment map of metabolic pathways. The enrichment map of metabolic pathways
  is used to show the different abomasum metabolic pathways in (A) 15% FDG-A vs. BD-A,
  (B) 30% FDG-A vs. BD-A, and (C) 30% FDG-A vs. 15% FDG-A. The enrichment map of metabolic
  pathways was used to show the different cecum metabolic pathways in (D) 15% FDG-C
  vs. BD-C and (E) 30% FDG-C vs. 15% FDG-C. In the enrichment map of metabolic pathways,
  the red dotted line represents a p-value = 0.01, and the blue dotted line represents
  a p-value = 0.05. When the top of the bar is beyond the blue line, it indicates
  that the signaling pathway it represents is significant
