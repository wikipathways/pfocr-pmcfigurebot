caption: Functional enrichment analysis of upregulated and downregulated genes in
  normal vs. ICH vs. severe ICH conditions, identified through KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis. Bar plot indicating the fold enrichment of selected pathways, with the
  number of genes involved depicted by the size of the dots and the false discovery
  rate (FDR) represented by color intensity (A). Detailed KEGG pathway map for “FcγR-Mediated
  Phagocytosis” (B) and “RAS Signaling Pathway” (C). Downregulated genes during severe
  ICH (ICH vs. severe ICH) with an FC < 0.67 are colored in red
