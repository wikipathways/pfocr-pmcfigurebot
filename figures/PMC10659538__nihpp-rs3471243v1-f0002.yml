figure_title: BMP/TGFβ signaling pathways are defective in the decidualizing stromal
  cells from individuals with endometriosis
caption: Differentially expressed genes between the endometrial stromal cells of individuals
  without (n=4) or with endometriosis (n=3) at each time point during the decidualization
  treatment were identified and visualized as volcano plots. Differentially expressed
  genes were determined using a cut off (|log2 fold-change| >1 and FDR < 0.05, red
  denotes increased genes, blue denotes decreased genes, gray indicates no significant
  change) and displayed following Day 2 (A), Day 4 (B), Day 6 (C), or Day 8 (D) of
  treatment with the EPC decidualization cocktail (35nM estradiol, 1μM medroxyprogesterone
  acetate, 50μM cAMP). E) Gene ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes
  was performed at each time point and visualized as a Dot Plot. Genes in the TGFβ
  signaling pathway were identified to be enriched at each of the time points after
  EPC treatment
