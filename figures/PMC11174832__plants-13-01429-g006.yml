caption: Model of the abscission activation signaling pathway in deciduous and evergreen
  hollies. In two deciduous hollies, I. asprella and I. polyneura, a classical abscission
  activation signaling pathway is identified. The 14-mer peptide, resulting from SBTs
  cleaving IDA, binds to both HAE/HSL2 and its co-receptor. Then, HAE/HSL2 initiates
  an MAPK cascade through an unidentified intermediate. Following the phosphorylation
  of AGL by MAPK, HAE/HSL2 transcription is de-repressed. A positive feedback loop
  is subsequently completed when newly generated HAE/HSL2 is transported to the plasma
  membrane. The core genes of this pathway are regulated by light. In I. latifolia,
  an evergreen species of Ilex, three SS-miRNAs fine-tune the expression of core genes,
  escaping from the light responsiveness
