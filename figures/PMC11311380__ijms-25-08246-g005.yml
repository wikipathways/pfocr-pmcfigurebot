  pathway.
caption: 'UA attenuated PASMC pyroptosis through inhibiting the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling
  pathway. (a,b) Western blotting analysis for the protein expression of p-P65 relative
  to P65 and p-IκB-α relative to IκB-α in hPASMCs exposed to hypoxia with or without
  UA treatment (n = 6 per group). ** p < 0.01 compared to the control group, # p <
  0.05 compared to the hypoxia group, ## p < 0.01 compared to the hypoxia group. (c,d)
  Western blotting analysis for the protein expression of p-P65 relative to P65 and
  p-IκB-α relative to IκB-α from lungs of mice exposed to normoxia (NOR) or hypoxia
  with UA (HX + UA) or vehicle (HX) treatment (n = 6 per group). ** p < 0.01 compared
  to the NOR group, # p < 0.05 compared to the HX group'
