caption: 'Combination treatment with gefitinib and TRQ inhibits the tumor growth in
  PC-9-PIK3CA-M xenograft model. (A) Evolution of tumor volumes of PC-9-PIK3CA-M xenograft
  model during treatment. (B) Representative PC-9-PIK3CA-M xenograft mice and tumors
  surgically removed. (C, D) The mRNA expression of SOX2, ALDH1A1 was assayed by PCR
  and protein levels of SOX2, ALDH1A1, p-STAT3 in tumors was detected by western blotting.
  (E) The intracellular ROS levels and mitochondrial superoxide levels in tumors was
  assayed by flow cytometry. Data were shown as means Â± SD (n = 5). *P < 0.05 versus
  the control group, #P < 0.05 versus the gefitinib alone group, **P or ##P < 0.01,
  ***P or ###P < 0.001. Ctrl, the control group; TRQ, Tanreqing injection; Gefi, gefitinib;
  SOX2, sex determining region Y-box 2; ALDH1A1, aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member
  A1.'
