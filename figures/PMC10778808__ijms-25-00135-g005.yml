figure_title: Leptin-induced IL-6 mRNA expression in Hofbauer cells is primarily mediated
  by ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
caption: 'Leptin-induced IL-6 mRNA expression in Hofbauer cells is primarily mediated
  by ERK1/2 signaling pathway. IL-6 mRNA levels in Hofbauer cells treated with 100,
  250, and 1000 ng/mL r-leptin ± specific inhibitors for STAT3 (A), STAT5 (B), p65
  NF-κB (C), and ERK1/2 (D) signaling pathways. Bars represent mean ± SEM, n = 3,
  * p < 0.05 vs. control (Cnt), analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance
  on Ranks followed by Student–Newman–Keuls multiple comparison method, # p < 0.05
  leptin with inhibitor vs. without inhibitor (A,B), ¥ p ≤ 0.001 leptin with inhibitor
  vs. without inhibitor (C,D) analyzed by t-test'
