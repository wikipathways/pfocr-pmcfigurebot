figure_title: Examination of established stable MPN clones containing CALR-exon 9-indel
  mutations.
caption: 'Examination of established stable MPN clones containing CALR-exon 9-indel
  mutations. (A) A schema depicting the viral vectors (upper panel) and the transduction
  procedures (lower panel). A human MPL sequence tagged with FLAG was cloned into
  an RFP-containing lentiviral vector, whereas human CALR exon 9 sequences [either
  wild-type (WT), type 1 mutant (52bp deletion), or type 2 mutant (5bp insertion)]
  were cloned into an MSCV vector harboring GFP fluorescence. Ba/F3 cells were transduced
  with both vectors to obtain four different clones. EV: empty vector. (B) Flow cytometric
  analysis demonstrating the obtainment of desirable dual RFP+GFP+-expressing cells.
  (C) Western blots on the expression of MPL, FLAG, and different forms of CALR proteins
  in various stable cell lines. (D) Western blots on the expression levels of proteins
  involved in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in the indicated cell lines. (E) Time-dependent
  proliferation of various stable cells in the absence of IL-3, as measured by manual
  counting. (F) Quantification of sub-G1 populations in each cell line. The content
  of DNA was analyzed with flow cytometry after Propidium Iodide (PI) staining. *:
