figure_title: Ori upregulated the expression of NRF2/HO-1/NQO-1 and increased the
  phosphorylation of AKT/AMPKα/GSK-3β signaling pathway.
caption: Ori upregulated the expression of NRF2/HO-1/NQO-1 and increased the phosphorylation
  of AKT/AMPKα/GSK-3β signaling pathway. (A–D) RAW246.7 cells were treated using Ori
  for 1, 3, and 6 h, and total protein was collected for western blot analysis of
  the expression of NRF2/HO-1/NQO-1 (n ≥ 3). (E–H) RAW246.7 cells were treated using
  Ori for 1, 3, and 6 h, and total protein was collected for Western blot analysis
  the phosphorylation of AKT/AMPKα/GSK-3β signaling pathway (n ≥ 3). The results shown
  are means ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
