  Extracts on C. elegans: Implications for MAPK Modulation, Germline Development,

caption: O. Cornuta extract induces the upregulation of the MAPK kinase pathway, resulting
  in germline abnormalities and influencing worm survival. Our observation highlights
  that not only does O. cornuta itself lead to the upregulation of the MAPK pathway,
  but the compounds within the O. cornuta extract also play a significant role in
  this process. This collective activation of the MAPK pathway underscores its pivotal
  involvement in influencing germline abnormalities and impacting worm survival. Our
