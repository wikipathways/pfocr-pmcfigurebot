caption: 'miRNAs play a pivotal role in maintaining the delicate balance between cell
  survival and death by modulating the activity of key pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
  MAPK, TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK/STAT. Pro-apoptotic miRNAs (a): Some miRNAs
  act as pro-apoptotic regulators targeting anti-apoptotic genes in signaling pathways,
  promoting programmed cell death. Anti-apoptotic miRNAs (b): Conversely, certain
  miRNAs serve as anti-apoptotic regulators by targeting pro-apoptotic genes, inhibiting
  apoptosis and promoting cell survival. Abbreviations: CKIα—Casein Kinase I alpha;
  GSK-3β—Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; TCF—T Cell Factor; LEF—Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding
  Factor; PDCD4—Programmed Cell Death Protein 4; FADD—Fas-Associated protein with
  Death Domain; PHLDA1—Pleckstrin Homology-like Domain, Family A, Member 1; Smurf2—SMAD-specific
  E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2; IRAK—Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase; TAK1—Transforming
  growth factor Beta-Activated Kinase 1. This figure was sourced from BioRender'
