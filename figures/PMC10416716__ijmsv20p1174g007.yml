figure_title: Interaction between trophoblast cells and T and NK cells.
caption: Interaction between trophoblast cells and T and NK cells. (A) Violin plot
  showing the expression patterns of signaling genes involved in the EGF signaling
  network. Normalized expression levels are shown in the violin plot. Red represents
  the NC group and blue represents the RM group. (B) Circle plot showing the EGF signaling
  pathway network in cells from maternal-fetal interface in NC and RM groups. The
  thicker the line represented, the stronger the interaction weights/strength between
  the two cell types. (C) Comparison of the contributions of ligand-receptor pairs
  in the EGF signaling pathway network between NC and RM groups. (D) Violin plot showing
  the expression patterns of signaling genes involved in the PARs signaling pathway
  network. Normalized expression levels are shown in the violin plot. Red represents
  the NC group and blue represents the RM group. (E) Circle plot showing the PARs
  signaling pathway network in cells from maternal-fetal interface in NC and RM groups.
  The thicker the line represented, the stronger the interaction weights/strength
  between the two cell types. (F) Comparison of the contributions of ligand-receptor
  pairs in the PARs signaling pathway network between NC and RM groups. (G) Violin
  plot showing the expression patterns of the signaling genes involved in the CD96
  signaling network. Normalized expression levels are shown in the violin plot. Red
  represents the NC group and blue represents the RM group. (H) Circle plot showing
  the CD96 signaling pathway network in cells from maternal-fetal interface in NC
  and RM groups. The thicker the line represented, the stronger the interaction weights/strength
  between the two cell types. (I) Comparison of the contributions of ligand-receptor
  pairs in the CD96 signaling pathway network between NC and RM groups
