caption: 'TRQ inhibited cell proliferation by down-regulating the ROS-mediated STAT3
  signaling pathway (A) CCK-8 assay was performed to detect the cell viability after
  cell lines were treated with TRQ, gefitinib, NAC alone or together for 48 h. (B)
  Database and PPI network were used to screen the possible targets between TRQ and
  EGFR-TKIs resistance. (C, D) Western blotting assay was used to detect the STAT3
  protein and its phosphorylation level in lung cancer cell lines after TRQ treatment.
  (E, F) Western blotting was used to detect the STAT3 protein and its phosphorylation
  level after treated with gefitinib, TRQ, NAC alone or together in 2D cell lines.
  Data were shown as means Â± SD of three independent experiments. *P or #P < 0.05,
  **P or ##P < 0.01, ***P or ###P < 0.001. Ctrl, the control group; TRQ, Tanreqing
  injection; Gefi, gefitinib; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PC-9-PIK3CA-M, PC-9-PIK3CA-mutation.'
article_title: Tanreqing injection inhibits stemness and enhances sensitivity of non-small
  cell lung cancer models to gefitinib through ROS/STAT3 signaling pathway.
