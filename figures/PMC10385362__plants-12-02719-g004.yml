caption: Venn diagram that shows the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified
  in four comparison groups of the X genotype (A) and W genotype (B). Additionally,
  KEGG enrichment pathway maps were generated to display the DEGs shared by the four
  comparison groups of the X genotype (C) and W genotype (E), while GO enrichment
  pathway maps were used to illustrate the DEGs shared by the four comparison groups
  of the X genotype (D) and W genotype (F). X represents drought-tolerant genotype
  and W represents drought-sensitive genotype
