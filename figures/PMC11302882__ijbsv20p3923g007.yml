figure_title: tRF-27 promoted the activation of MTORC1.
caption: tRF-27 promoted the activation of MTORC1. A-B. The expression levels of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway proteins were detected in cells with tRF-27 overexpression (tRF-27
  OE) and knockdown tRF-27 (tRF-27 IN) in a trastuzumab-stimulating environment. TRF-27
  did not affect the proteins upstream MTORC1, but significantly promoted MTORC1 activation.
  C-F. Immunofluorescence with G3BP1,G3BP2, LAMP1, Tuberin and RPTOR. When tRF-27
  was overexpressed, the colocalization of G3BP1 and Tuberin with LAMP1 was hindered.
  Knocking down tRF-27 increased the colocalization of G3BP1 and LAMP1. Overexpressing
  tRF-27 also separated G3BP1 from RPTOR. G. Overexpression of tRF-27 promoted phosphorylation
  of Tuberin
