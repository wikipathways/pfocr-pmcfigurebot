caption: The impacts of Hippo signaling pathway dysregulations during ovarian oncogenesis
  were examined. (Aâ€“C) The molecular signatures database (MSigDB) was used to collect
  Hippo signaling pathway signatures, and the mRNA expression profiles of ovarian
  cancer GSE6008 (A), GSE10971 (B), and GSE14407 (C) were studied to determine their
  activation patterns. Compared to other ovarian cancer subtypes, the Z score activation
  pattern shows that Hippo signaling pathways are significantly more abundant in serous
  subtypes. The p-values for each subtype-specific enrichment of the samples were
  determined using the hypergeometric distribution
