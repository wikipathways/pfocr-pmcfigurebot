caption: Comparative analysis of cell communication networks in Ctrl and RA samples.
  (a) Comparison of the number and strength of interactions of cellular communication
  networks of cells in Ctrl and RA PBMCs. (b) Heatmap showing the difference in intensity
  and number of interactions of different cells in different signals in PBMCs of Ctrl
  and RA samples. The top colored bar indicates the sum of the column values shown
  in the afferent pathways heatmap. The colored bar on the right indicates the sum
  of the outgoing signals. (c) The rank of all significant pathways is based on the
  difference in total information flow in the inferred network between the Ctrl and
  RA samples. The total information flow of the signaling network is calculated by
  summing the probability of all communications in the network. The top pathway colored
  in red is more common in the Ctrl samples, and the bottom pathway colored in green
  is more common in the RA samples. (d) Heatmap comparison of changes in afferent
  or efferent pathways associated with each cell population in the Ctrl and RA samples
