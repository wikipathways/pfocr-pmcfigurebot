caption: The genomic organization of MAB_0937c and MAB_0939 genes in mycobacteria.
  (A) The genome comparisons for the MmpL10 protein regions of MAB, M. smegmatis,
  and M. tuberculosis were obtained by reference articles [51] and the genomic database
  at the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide). The same color of arrows shows
  orthologous genes. (B) The insertion sites of MycoMar transposon are shown for MAB_0937c
  and MAB_3909 genes. MAB mutants were sequenced using ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR),
  as previously detailed [13]. (C) The schematic representation of the biosynthetic
  pathway of diacyltrehalose/polyacyltrehalose in mycobacteria. DAT is synthesized
  in the cytoplasm from the esterification of a straight-chain fatty acid by the PapA3
  acyltransferase to the two positions and the three positions of trehalose [54].
  The MmpL10 is involved in the transport of DAT across the cell membrane, where it
  then undergoes transesterification into PAT on the cell surface. The genes involved
  in this biosynthesis pathway are clustered together in specific genomic regions
  and are conserved across mycobacteria [51]
