caption: 'The expression of mitogen‐activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) in the tumor
  tissue of patients with clinical non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (a) The microarray
  of NSCLC tissues obtained from relevant patients was analyzed by multiplex immunofluorescence
  staining of CD34 and MAPK4. MAPK4 staining is shown in red, CD34 staining is shown
  in green, and 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI) staining is shown in blue. Carcinoma
  tissues (1, 3, 5…17): 92 samples; paracarcinoma tissues (2, 4, 6…18): 88 samples.
  (b) The expression of MAPK4 in carcinoma and paracarcinoma clinical samples from patients
  with NSCLC were analyzed, and the H‐scores were calculated. (c) Comparison of MAPK4
  expression in CD34‐positive cells between cancer and adjacent tissues. (d) The 5‐year
  overall survival rate in the four groups was determined through Kaplan–Meier analysis.'
