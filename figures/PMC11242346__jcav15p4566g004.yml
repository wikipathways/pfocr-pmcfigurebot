caption: KEGG pathway analysis of genes co-expressed with OTUB1 in GBM. (A) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of genes co-expressed with OTUB1 in GBM. (B) The correlation
  of genes co-expressed with OTUB1 and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. (C-D) Expression
  of JAK, p-JAK2, STAT1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT1 in U87 cells with OTUB1 overexpression
  or silencing using Western blot. ns p>0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. GBM, glioblastoma;
  GSEA, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; Janus kinase, JAK; p-JAK, phosphorylated JAK;
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; phosphorylated, p-STAT
