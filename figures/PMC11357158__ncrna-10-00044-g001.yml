figure_title: The biological pathways and interactions of three ncRNAs.
caption: The biological pathways and interactions of three ncRNAs. MiRNAs are produced
  from pri-miRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II from independent genes or introns
  of protein genes. The pri-miRNAs are processed by a complex involving Drosha and
  DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8) to create pre-miRNAs, which are then
  exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5. In the cytoplasm, Dicer cleaves the pre-miRNA
  to form a miRNA duplex, with one strand being degraded and the other becoming the
  mature miRNA. The mature miRNA, along with Argonaute2 (AGO2) and glycine-tryptophan
  repeat-containing protein of 182 KDa (GW182), binds to the 3′-untranslated region
  (3′-UTR) of targeted mRNA to inhibit its translation. LncRNAs are transcribed by
  RNA polymerase II and have a structure similar to mRNA. They can be transported
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1). Some lncRNAs
  act as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), binding to miRNAs to affect gene expression.
  LncRNAs can also interact with RBPs to stabilize and promote mRNA translation. CircRNAs
  are produced from pre-mRNA through backsplicing and can regulate gene expression
  by acting as ceRNAs to inhibit miRNA and increase expression of targeted genes
