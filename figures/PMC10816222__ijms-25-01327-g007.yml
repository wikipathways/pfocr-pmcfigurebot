figure_title: The expression levels of drought-related genes in 6 different pathways
  were analyzed in Arabidopsis.
caption: 'The expression levels of drought-related genes in 6 different pathways were
  analyzed in Arabidopsis. The expression levels of WT lines were normalized. (A)
  Changes in NCED1 gene expression before and after drought stress in WT lines and
  OE lines. (B) Changes in AtARRE gene expression before and after drought stress
  in WT lines and OE lines. (C) Changes in SnRK2.3 gene expression before and after
  drought stress in WT lines and OE lines. (D) Changes in F3’H gene expression before
  and after drought stress in WT lines and OE lines. (E) Changes in WSD1 gene expression
  before and after drought stress in WT lines and OE lines. (F) Changes in USL1 gene
  expression before and after drought stress in WT lines and OE lines. Using Student’s
  t-test, asterisks indicate significant differences: non-significant (ns) and p <
  0.01 (**). Data are shown as mean ± SD from three independent experiments'
