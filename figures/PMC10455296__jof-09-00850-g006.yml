figure_title: Biosynthesis of carotenoids in Fusarium species.
caption: 'Biosynthesis of carotenoids in Fusarium species. (A) Comparison of carBGCs
  from different Fusarium species: homologous genes are connected by a band of the
  same color, and the identity value between the two homologous proteins is shown
  below the previous gene. (B) Biosynthetic pathways of carotenoids: CarRA indicates
  bifunctional phytoene synthase/carotene cyclase; CarB indicates phytotene desaturase;
  CarT indicates cleaving oxygenase; CarD indicates aldehyde dehydrogenase; and CarX
  indicates oxygenase'
