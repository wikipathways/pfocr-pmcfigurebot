figure_title: Anticancer properties of glycyrrhizinic acid in cervical cancer models.
caption: Anticancer properties of glycyrrhizinic acid in cervical cancer models. Gly
  inhibits the Notch signalling pathway, leading to reduced expression of Clicin D1,
  HES1, Bcl2, C-MYC, etc., and to an increase in the expression of Bad, Bax, p21,
  etc. As a result, Gly prevents the proliferation of cervical cancer cells, induces
  their apoptosis, and prevents epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition and cell migration.
  The proapototic action of Gly is mediated by both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.
  Gly also reduces the levels of the viral oncoproteins HPV-E6/E7, leading to an increase
  in p53. On the other hand, Gly directly inactivates HMGB1, thus preventing the increase
  in Treg cells and a decrease in pDCs in the tumour microenvironment, preventing
  evasion to the control of the immune system
