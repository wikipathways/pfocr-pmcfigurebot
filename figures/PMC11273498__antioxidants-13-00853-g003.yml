caption: Metabolic processes of FA in bacteria or fungi. (A) Dihydroxylation; (B)
  restoration; (C) demethylation; (D) decarboxylation; (E) deacetylation. Fcs (this
  gene encodes feruloyl-CoA synthetase), ech (this gene encodes the enzyme enoyl-CoA
  hydratase/aldolase), and vdh (an enzyme that encodes vanilla dehydrogenase) refer
  to key genes in the coenzyme A-dependent Î²-free oxidation pathway. VanAB is a demethylase
  (the gene-encoding vanillic acid O-demethylase). The contents marked in purple are
  key genes in the metabolic pathway
