caption: Schematic of the urea cycle and polyamine synthesis. Arginine acquired from
  the culture medium or from protein degradation can be converted to ornithine by
  parasite or human arginase. Ornithine feeds the polyamine synthesis pathway. Relative
  abundances of putrescine, spermine, spermidine, and MTA are higher in ΔFM parasites.
  ARSL catalyzes the conversion of argininosuccinate to arginine, generating fumarate
  as a byproduct. In human cells, ARSL operates in the reverse direction in the presence
  of excess fumarate. Rectangles under the urea cycle enzymes indicate if a homolog
  is present (green), predicted (yellow), or absent (white) in Plasmodium falciparum
  (P) and in the human RBC (H). ARSL, argininosuccinate lyase; ARSS, argininosuccinate
  synthetase; dcSAM, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine; ΔFM, double knockout mutant
  of FH and MQO; MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide
  synthase; OTC, ornithine transcarbamylase; RBC, red blood cell.
