caption: Schematic overview of the current knowledge of regulatory pathways potentially
  involved in the control of symbiosis by photosynthesis. On the one hand, sucrose
  resulting from photosynthesis is exported to the roots and the nodules. The fraction
  of sugars metabolized via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) generates
  reducing power (via the NADP/NADPH ratio), controlling the cellular redox state
  (ROS-NO). Redox state is involved in the regulation of many aspects of the establishment
  and the functioning of symbiosis. In the root, the redox state and the OPPP are
  also implicated in the regulation of NO3− transporters. On the other hand, in the
  leaves, the b-ZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTHYL 5 (HY5) is activated
  by light and regulates the assimilation and export of carbon to the root system.
  HY5 may translocate from shoots to roots via the phloem. In roots, HY5 together
  with the nuclear factor HIGH NITROGEN INSENSITIVE 9 (HNI9) activates the ROS detoxification
  program in connection with the cellular redox state and regulates downstream NO3−
  transporters and nodule organogenesis (in soybean). Ca/b, chlorophyll a/b binding
  complex; PS, photosystem; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; NO, nitric oxide; OPPP, oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway; PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; phosphoglycerate; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; Ru5P, ribose-5-phosphate; RubP, ribulose-5-phosphate.
