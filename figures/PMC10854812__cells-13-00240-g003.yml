caption: Model for the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs) from both tumor and
  normal cells. (A) Development of CSCs from cancer cells is mediated by the activation
  of aberrant signaling pathways via driver mutation-dependent mechanisms and transcriptional
  activation of self-renewal genes. Cancer cells become programmed to divide into
  cancer progenitor cells and CSCs. Cancer progenitor cells are genetically programmed
  to divide into one differentiated cell and one CSC. Once the dedifferentiation process
  of the differentiated cell has been completed, it can be transformed into a CSC
  that ultimately undergoes abnormal asymmetric cell division to produce genetically
  divergent subpopulations including CSCs and non-CSCs. (B) The development of CSCs
  from the activation of self-renewal genes normal stem/progenitor cells via multiple
  genetic mutations and dedifferentiation-dependent mechanisms. Like cancer cell-derived
  CSCs, CSCs derived from normal stem/progenitor cells undergo abnormal asymmetric
  cell division to produce two genetically divergent subpopulations including CSC
  and non-CSC
