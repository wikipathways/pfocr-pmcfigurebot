caption: Schematic representation of TLR2 dimers and their signaling pathway. Like
  other TLRs, TLR2 forms homo- or heterodimers that allow for activation and signaling
  upon ligand binding. TLR2 islocalized in the outer cell membrane, and mainly dimerizes
  with TLR1 and TLR6. TLR2 uses the canonical MyD88 pathway to transduce a signal
  that, through the IRAK–TRAF6 complex, induces the activation of NF-κB and MAPK.
  NF-κB is responsible for the transcription of several pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  The MAPK pathway induces the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, promoting cancer
  cell invasion and metastasis. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 22 December
