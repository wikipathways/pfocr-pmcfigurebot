figure_title: The binding of the mature BDNF isoform (m-BDNF) to the tyrosine kinase
  B (TrkB) receptor leads to dimerization and phosphorylations in the intracellular
  Trk domains, thereby initiating the cytoplasmic signaling pathways mediated by activation
  of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK), and phospholipase C (PLC).
caption: The binding of the mature BDNF isoform (m-BDNF) to the tyrosine kinase B
  (TrkB) receptor leads to dimerization and phosphorylations in the intracellular
  Trk domains, thereby initiating the cytoplasmic signaling pathways mediated by activation
  of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK), and phospholipase C (PLC). Ultimately, the activation of these pathways
  leads to dendritic growth and branching, as well as regulation of apoptosis and
  synaptic plasticity. The binding of the pro-neurotrophin isoform of BDNF (pro-BDNF)
  to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) leads to the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal
  kinases (JNK) signaling pathway, which promotes apoptosis, and the RhoA (Ras homolog
  gene family member) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB) signaling pathways, which
  cause neuronal growth and neuronal survival. Akt, protein kinase B; BDNF, brain-derived
