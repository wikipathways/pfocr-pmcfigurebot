figure_title: Findings in VDAART validation cohort.
caption: Findings in VDAART validation cohort. (A) Forest plot showing association
  between PC1 and PC2 scores from a maternal gestation weeks 32 to 38 PCA model based
  on 45 metabolites selected from COPSAC2010 findings. Each dot represents relative
  risk per unit of component score, while the error bar represents 95% CI of relative
  risk. Different colors represent types of clinical end points. Linear regression
  models were used between the metabolites and lung function end points. Logistic
  regression models were used for asthma wheezing by age 3y and asthma at age 3y,
  while quasi-Poisson regression models were used for number of infection episodes
  during age 3 months and 3 years. (B) Pathway enrichment analysis based on metabolites
  with VIP scores >2. The y-axis indicates the metabolic sub-pathway name, while the
  x-axis indicates logarithm of the enriched factor in each pathway. The bubble size
  and color indicate the P value. Sphingomyelin pathway was the enriched metabolic
  pathway showing strongest significance with vitamin D level at gestation weeks 32
  to 38. exc, Excluding; Epi.No., number of episodes; IOS R5, impulse oscillometry
