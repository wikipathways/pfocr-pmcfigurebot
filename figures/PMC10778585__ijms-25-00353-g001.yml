  in cells.
caption: The proteomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 modulates FHL2 expression
  in cells. Caco2 cells were infected with the WT strain at 0.01 MOI, and the infected
  cells were collected at 0, 12, and 24 h post-infection (hpi), followed by lysate
  preparation for quantitative proteomic analysis. (A) The histogram illustrates differential
  proteins at 12 hpi compared to 0 hpi. Under the condition of Padj ≤ 0.05, 2977 proteins
  were screened, with 139 proteins up-regulated and 60 proteins down-regulated (Table
  S1). (B) KEGG analysis of differentially expressed proteins, highlighting the significant
  enrichment of the first 14 pathways in differentially expressed proteins (p < 0.05).
  (C) Venn diagram depicting proteins related to the P53 signaling pathway and PPAR
  signaling pathway selected from the differential proteins (Table S4). (D) Graph
  showing the change trend in FHL2 LFQ intensity in Caco2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2.
  (E) Western blot analysis of FHL2 protein levels in Caco2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2
  at 0.01 MOI at 12 hpi, 24 hpi, and 36 hpi. (F) RT-qPCR results illustrating the
  mRNA levels of FHL2 in Caco2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 0.01 MOI at 12 hpi,
  24 hpi, and 36 hpi. (G) Western blot analysis of FHL2 expression levels in Caco2
  cells transfected with SARS-CoV-2 N protein expression plasmids for 24 h. Three
  biological replicates were performed for each sample. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001
