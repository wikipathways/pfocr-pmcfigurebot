caption: Network connectivity pathway map of ACE2’s downstream effects of simulated
  SARS-CoV-2 infection on predicted activity of SNCA and PD. COVID-19-induced inhibition
  via downregulation of IFNG inhibits ACE2, leading to activation of IL1B and AGT
  and inhibition of CCL5, causing an overall activation of SNCA
