caption: Anti-cancer mechanisms of five agents (1) resveratrol induces growth inhibition
  and apoptosis in colon cancer DLD-1 cells by reducing miRNA-96 expression through
  MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway activation. (2) Picrasidine induces apoptosis and
  G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in colon cancer cells by upregulating miR-22, which targets
  the mRNA 3′-untranslated region of ERBB3 and MECOM and the Wnt/β-catenin and MEK/ERK
  pathways. (3) Rosemary extract prevents colon cancer cell metastasis and dysplasia
  via GCNT3, the target of miR-15b. (4) UA induces apoptosis by regulating Bax and
  Bcl-2 and upregulating miR-4500 expression in CRC cells through the p53 pathway,
  inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation. (5) Curcumin is involved in NF-κB inflammatory
  process and regulates the Akt/mTOR pathway by downregulating EGFR and oncogenic
  miR-21 and upregulating mir-200 family translation, promoting apoptosis
