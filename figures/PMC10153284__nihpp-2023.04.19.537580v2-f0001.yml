figure_title: CD8+ T cell-specific Panx1 is required for T cell activation and effector
  differentiation
caption: (a) Panx1 mRNA expression from RNA-seq samples in the indicated subsets of
  LCMV-gp33 transgenic P14 CD8+ T cells. (b) Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) analysis
  of effector P14 cells showing UMAP cluster distribution (left) and expression of
  Panx1 mRNA in each cluster (right). (c) Western Blot analysis of Panx1 expression
  in WT (CD4-Cre) or Panx1-KO (CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl) CD8+ T cells at 0h or 72h after
  activation with anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2. (d) WT (CD4-Cre) or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl mice
  were infected with LCMV-Arm. Numbers of total (left) and TE, MP (right) spleen gp33+
  CD8+ T cells at day 7 post-infection are shown. (e-g) A 1:1 mix of bone marrow cells
  from CD4-Cre (WT; CD45.1+) and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl (Panx1-KO; CD45.2+) mice was transferred
  into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice (CD45.1/2+). After two months, BM chimeric
  mice were infected with LCMV-Arm. The red dotted lines show the Panx1-KO:WT ratios
  after two months of reconstitution. (e) Graphical scheme. (f) Representative flow
  cytometry plots showing WT and Panx1-KO total, TE and MP spleen gp33+ CD8+ T cells
  at day 7 post-infection. (g) Panx1-KO/WT ratios of total (left) and of naïve, TE
  and MP spleen gp33+ CD8+ T cells (right) at day 7 post-infection. (h) Heatmaps showing
  the expression of TCR signaling pathway genes from RNA-seq data of activated WT
  and Panx1-KO CD8+ T cells. (i) CD4-Cre or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl mice were infected
  with LCMV-Arm and evaluated at 3 days after infection. Representative histograms
  (left) and average percentages (right) of Ki-67+ gp33+ CD8+ T cells are shown. (j-k)
  CD4-Cre (WT; CD45.1/2+) and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl (Panx1-KO; CD45.2+) P14 cells were
  labeled with Cell Trace Violet and co-transferred into LCMV-infected recipient C57BL/6
  (CD45.1+) mice. (j) Histograms showing Cell Trace Violet dilution (left) and graphs
  showing average gMFI values (right) are shown. (k) Representative flow cytometry
  plots showing expression of CD44 and CD69 are shown in the left. In the right, average
  percentages of CD44+CD69+ cells (above) and of CD62L+ cells (below) are shown. (l-q)
  WT (CD4-Cre) or Panx1-KO (CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl) CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro
  (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2, and in some cases PMA/Ionomycin) for up to 72h. In some experiments
  (o), WT Nur77-GFP CD8+ T cells were activated in the presence of vehicle (PBS; Control)
  or Trovafloxacin (Panx1 inhibitor; Panx1i). (l) Representative flow cytometry plots
  showing expression of CD69 and dilution of Cell Trace Violet at 24h, 48h and 72h
  after activation. (m) Percentages of Cell Trace Violet (CTV) divided cells (top
  left), average gMFI values for CD44 (top right), and percentages of CD69+ (bottom
  left) and CD25+ (bottom right) cells at 24h, 48h and 72h after activation. (n) Representative
  histograms showing expression of IFNγ (top) and average percentages of IFNγ+ CD8+
  T cells (bottom) at 72h after activation. (o) Representative histograms showing
  Nur77-GFP expression in control of Panx1i-treated cells (above), and average percentages
  of Nur77-GFP+ CD8+ T cells (below) at 3h after activation are shown. (p) Average
  percentages of CD44+ (left) and CD69+ (right) cells at 3h after activation with
  either anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/Ionomycin are shown. (q) CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl
  mice were infected with LCMV-Arm; at day 7 after infection, the percentages of FMK/FLICA+
  and PI+ cells were assessed in gp33+ CD8+ T cells. In the left, representative flow
  cytometry plots are shown; in the right, average percentages of FMK/FLICA+ cells
  are depicted. (c) Data representative of 2 independent experiments, n=4–5 per group.
  (d-j, q) Data from 2–3 independent experiments, n=5–12 per experimental group. (k)
  Each replicate is a pool of activated CD8+ T cells from three mice; n=3 replicates
  per experimental group. (l-p) Data from four independent experiments, n=7–11 per
  experimental group per time point. ns – not significant (p>0.05), *p<0.05, **p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001, Unpaired t-test (d, j-k, n-o), One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  post-test (d, g, i, k, p-q), Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-test (g, m)
