caption: Representative image illustrating the molecular pathogenesis of NF1. NF1
  codes for neurofibromin, which is a crucial Ras-GTPase-activating protein. Loss
  of NF1 expression leads to Ras hyperactivation, which causes the subsequent activation
  of the Raf/MEK/ERK and the AKT/mTOR pathways. NF1 plays a role also in modulating
  the ATP-cAMP signalling pathway. The convergence of these pathway activations ultimately
  leads to aberrant cell growth and uncontrolled proliferation
