caption: Trajectory analysis of PT cells after injury (failed repair PT, successful
  repair PT, and injured PT), and oxidative stress characteristics of the failed repaired
  PT cell subset. (A) Monocle2 pseudotime trajectory of proximal tubular cells, which
  were colored based on the pseudotime. (B) Monocle2 pseudotime trajectory of proximal
  tubular cells, which were colored based on cluster identity. (C) Monocle2 pseudotime
  trajectory of proximal tubular cells, which were colored based on the cell state.
  (D–F) UMAP rendering of signaling pathways. (D) Note that TNF-α signaling via the
  NF-κB pathway was enriched in both injured PT cells and failed repair PT cells.
  (E) Note that the inflammatory response pathways were enriched in injured PT cells
  and failed repair PT cells. (F) Note that the DNA repair pathway was enriched in
  the failed repair PT cells. (G) Pseudotemporal gene-expression profiles of some
  DEGs in PT cell subsets, excluding the ribosomal and mitochondrial genes. Right
  bar diagrams display the enriched KEGG terms of the three gene modules. (H) The
  heatmap shows that transcription factors (TFs) that are significantly associated
  with the development of different PT cell subsets. The number in the brackets behind
  the genes represents the target gene number regulated by the transcription factors
