caption: Role of ferroptosis in tumor immunity. Immunotherapy-activated CD8+ T cells
  release IFN-γ, which transcriptionally inhibits SLC7A11 and SLC3A2 by activating
  JAK1-STAT1 signaling. IFN-γ also induces ACSL4 expression and promotes the generation
  of lipid peroxidation substrate PUFA-PLs. Immunotherapy-induced release of TGFβ1
  transcriptionally represses SLC7A11 through the SMAD-involved pathway. Immunotherapy
  inhibits SLC7A11 synergistically with radiotherapy-activated ATM. Immunotherapy
  can also synergize with FINs to promote lipid peroxidation. DAMPs released by ferroptotic
  cells enhance antitumor immune responses by reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment.
  Lipid metabolites activate macrophages immune responses and adaptive immunity-driven
  cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the release of HMGB1 during ferroptosis leads
  to the up-regulation of TNFα in macrophages and sustains the immune response. On
  the other hand, ferroptotic cells can inhibit antitumor immunity by releasing KRAS
  (G12D), which triggers M2 macrophage polarization. 8-OHG released by ferroptotic
  cells activates STING signaling in macrophages, leading to an inflammatory tumor
  microenvironment and causing tumorigenesis. TNFα tumor necrosis factor-alpha, DAMPs
