figure_title: Molecular analysis of brain tissue of patient with RE.
caption: Molecular analysis of brain tissue of patient with RE. (A) Heatmap from RT
  2 Profiler™ PCR Array human cell cycle pathway genes. Data are representative of
  log2 fold change difference from a control group (n = 5) and a Rasmussen patient.
  (B) Volcano plot for control group versus Rasmussen patient showing significantly
  down-regulated genes which passed the −1.3 (p < 0.05) threshold for log2 fold change
  difference. p-values are calculated based on a Student’s t-test of the mean 2 −ΔCT
  values for each gene in the control group versus the Rasmussen patient. (C) Log2
  fold change from top five down-regulated genes. (D) Protein levels from Luminex
  immunoassay
