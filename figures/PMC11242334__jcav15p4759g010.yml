caption: TLE4's suppression of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in PTC cells. A. Quantitative
  PCR (qPCR) analysis showing significant downregulation of JAK2 and STAT3 mRNA levels
  in PTC cells overexpressing TLE4. B. Western blot analysis confirming the reduced
  protein expression of JAK2 and STAT3 in TLE4-overexpressed cells. C. Cell viability
  assays demonstrating decreased cell growth following treatment with the JAK2/STAT3
  inhibitor AG490 in PTC cell lines. D. & E. The inhibitory effects of TLE4 on cell
  migration and invasion are paralleled by the application of AG490
