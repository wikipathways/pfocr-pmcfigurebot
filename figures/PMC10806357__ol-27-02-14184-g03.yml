caption: Univariate survival analysis of the association between DKK1 expression and
  survival time in 12 tumor types. (A) Forest plot showing the relationship between
  DKK1 expression and OS. KM curves of high and low DKK1 expression in (B) ESCA, (C)
  HNSC and (D) STAD reveal a significant association with OS. (E) Forest plot showing
  the relationship between DKK1 expression and DSS. KM curves of high and low DKK1
  expression in (F) HNSC and (G) STAD show a significant association with DSS. DKK1,
  Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor 1; OS, overall survival; DSS, disease-specific
  survival; KM, Kaplan-Meier; BLCA, bladder urothelial carcinoma; CHOL, cholangiocarcinoma;
  COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; ESCA, esophageal carcinoma; HNSC, head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma; KICH, kidney chromophobe; KIRP, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma;
  LIHC, liver hepatocellular carcinoma; LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; PRAD,
  prostate adenocarcinoma; STAD, stomach adenocarcinoma; THCA, thyroid carcinoma;
  HR, hazard ratio
