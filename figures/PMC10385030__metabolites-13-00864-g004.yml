caption: Mapping of the metabolic pathway and dynamic changes in the representative
  different key metabolites in two grades of high-quality DCT. Data are shown in scatter
  box plot as mean ± SD using relative abundance, as calculated by normalization to
  total ion intensity (×105). The orange and blue boxes represent metabolite intensities
  in BDCT and SDCT, respectively. * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.001, ***
  represents p < 0.0005, **** suggests p < 0.0001. Statistical significance was determined
  by the Mann–Whitney U test
