caption: GOrilla reveals the GO terms in the process gene ontology domains, enriched
  with genes differentially expressed in 18Aβ when compared to 3Vh, the image shows
  the enlargement of the picture provide as Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material.
  The pathway analysis was conducted on 1605 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05).
  Yellow squares represent the GO terms with 10−3 < p < 10−5, and orange squares represent
  10−5 < p < 10−7
