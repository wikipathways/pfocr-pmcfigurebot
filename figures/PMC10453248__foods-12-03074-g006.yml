figure_title: TPE modulated the serum metabonomic in mice fed HFD.
caption: TPE modulated the serum metabonomic in mice fed HFD. Serum metabonomic profiling
  by UHPLC-MS/MS (ESI+). (A) PLS-DA score plot of serum metabolic profiles of the
  ND, HFD, and HFD + HTP groups; (B) OPLS-DA score plot of serum metabolic profiles
  of the HFD and HFD + HTP groups. Serum metabonomic profiling by UHPLC-MS/MS (ESIâˆ’).
  (C) PLS-DA score plot of serum metabolic profiles of the ND, HFD, and HFD + HTP
  groups; (D) OPLS-DA score plot of serum metabolic profiles of the HFD and HFD +
  HTP groups. (E) Heatmap of relative abundance of significant different metabolites
  (VIP > 1.0, and p < 0.05) in the HFD and HFD + HTP groups. (F) Summary of metabolic
  pathway analysis with MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (each point represents one metabolic pathway;
  the size of dot and shades of color are positive correlations with the impact of
  the metabolic pathway)
