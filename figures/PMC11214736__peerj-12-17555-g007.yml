figure_title: The effects of PLAUR on ccRCC cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and
  EMT were analyzed
caption: (A) The apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry with the Annexin V-FITC/PI
  flow double staining kit, and the population of cells positive for Annexin V was
  designated as undergoing apoptosis. PLAUR knockdown promoted cell apoptosis in ccRCC
  cells. (B) The effect of PLAUR knockdown on the cell cycle in 786-O and ACHN cells
  was analyzed, ccRCC cells were regulated and blocked in G2 phase. (C) The protein
  levels of vimentin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and MMP9 in 786-O and ACHN cells following
  PLAUR knockdown were assessed using the Western blot. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, ***
  P < 0.001.
