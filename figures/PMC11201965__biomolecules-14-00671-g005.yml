figure_title: MenSCs inhibited CBS expression to improve GSIS and glycolysis in islet
  cells.
caption: MenSCs inhibited CBS expression to improve GSIS and glycolysis in islet cells.
  (A) Insulin secretion of islet cells under normal, TAC, AOAA, and TACM treatments
  (n = 6) was observed at 20× magnification with a scale ruler of 100 μm. (B,C) GSIS
  of islet cells under normal, TAC, AOAA, and TACM conditions (n = 6). (D) GSEA of
  the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway after beta-TC-6 was treated with TAC and
  TACM. (E–K) Evaluation of glycolysis-related genes (RNA expression of GLUT1, GLUT2,
  HK4, PFKM, PKM, and PFKFB2) in MIN6 and β-TC-6 cells in TAC, CBS knockdown, and
  TACM treatment (n = 3). (L,M) Protein expression of Aldob, GLUT1, GLUT2, HK4, PKM,
  and PFK in MIN6 and β-TC-6 cells in TAC, CBS knockdown, and TACM conditions. Original
  images can be found in Supplementary Materials. (N–S) Detection of HK4, PK, and
  PFKM expression in the supernatant of one million MIN6 and one million β-TC-6 cells
  after treatment with TAC, CBS knockdown, or TACM for 24 h using ELISA (n = 6). Statistical
  analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance. Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001; “ns”
  denotes not statistically significant)
