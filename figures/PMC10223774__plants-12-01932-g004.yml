figure_title: Expression profiles of genes in ABC transporters, the phosphatidylinositol
  signaling system, ROS and the Ca2+ signaling pathway.
caption: 'Expression profiles of genes in ABC transporters, the phosphatidylinositol
  signaling system, ROS and the Ca2+ signaling pathway. (A) Simplified illustration
  of most relevant molecule discovered to be related to LSI. (B) Comparison of expression
  patterns of vital genes related to phosphatidylinositol signaling system, ROS and
  Ca2+ signaling pathway in self- and nonpollinated ovaries. yellow and blue represent
  relative decreases and increases in expression, respectively (log2 fold change).
  The annotation of these genes is displayed in Supplementary Table S2. ACA: Calcium-transporting
  ATPase; CAMBP25: calmodulin-binding protein 25; FER: receptor-like protein kinase
  FERONIA; GSTF: glutathione S-transferase; RBOHA: respiratory burst oxidase protein
  like; DGK: diacylglycerol kinase 1-like isoform X2; FAB1B: 1-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
  5-kinase FAB1B-like isoform X1; IPK: inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase; PIP5K6:
  phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase 6-like; PLC6: phosphoinositide phospholipase
  C 6-like; VIP: nositol hexakisphosphate and diphosphoinositol-pentakisphosphate
  kinase VIP2-like. (C) Comparison of the expression profiles of important genes related
  to the ABC transporter pathway in self- and nonpollinated ovaries of Camellia oleifera.
  green and blue indicate relative decreases and increases in expression (log2 fold
  change). A list of these genesâ€™ annotations may be found in Supplementary Table
