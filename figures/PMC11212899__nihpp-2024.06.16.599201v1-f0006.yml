figure_title: Probing the leading genes of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway for sex
  differences.
caption: 'Probing the leading genes of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway for sex differences.
  Panel a shows the top 500 edges of the differential network Afemale-Amale centered
  on the n2v2r leading genes of the JAK/STAT pathway as returned by GSEApy, shown
  here with larger fonts. Red edges mean greater co-expression in females, and blue
  edges greater in males. The size of the nodes is the absolute degree difference.
  Nodes are colored according to the adjusted p-value from differential gene expression
  analysis with DESeq2: white is not significant, yellow to red is significant between
  0.1 and 0. Panel b shows significant sex-biased drug responses (lower more sensitive)
  by inhibiting JAK/STAT genes in LUAD cell lines that are not differential in node
  degree and gene expression. The EP300 is from the GDSC repository, the rest from
  PRISM'
