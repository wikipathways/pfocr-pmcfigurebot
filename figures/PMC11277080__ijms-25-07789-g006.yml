figure_title: Biochemical and metabolic analysis of the myotubes derived from control
  and p38αAF mice.
caption: 'Biochemical and metabolic analysis of the myotubes derived from control
  and p38αAF mice. (A) p38 MAPK phosphorylation: Myotubes were grown for 24 h in the
  absence or presence of 0.4 mM of palmitate. Insulin (10 μg/mL) was added 30 min
  before the proteins were extracted and analyzed by Western blotting using the designated
  antibodies. (B) Insulin signaling pathway: The same protein samples as in (A) were
  analyzed by Western blotting using the designated antibodies. (C) Metabolism of
  the (U-13C6) glucose in myotubes: (U-13C6) glucose was introduced to the myotube
  media with or without 0.4 mM of palmitate for 24 h. The relative levels of glucose
  6-phosphate (+6), fructose 6-phosphate (+6), and ribose phosphate (+5) isotopologues
  are presented. The peak area was normalized to protein concentration. (D) Medium
  acidification (ECAR) of myotubes in a “Seahorse” analysis: Myotubes were grown in
  glucose, or glucose and palmitate, for 24 h before analysis. (E) Metabolism of the
  (U-13C6) glucose in myotubes: The relative levels of the isotopologues of citrate
  are presented. The peak areas were normalized to protein concentration. (F) Mitochondrial
  enzymes: The same protein samples as in (A) were analyzed by Western blotting. The
  histograms present the relative expression and phosphorylation of PDH (Ser293),
  and the expression of citrate synthase. Data represent the means ± SEM. The Wilcoxon
  test and significance probabilities between treatments are designated as follows:
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 (C,E). One-way ANOVA was followed by
  Tukey post-tests (D). The p values for group differences are designated as follows:
  * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001'
