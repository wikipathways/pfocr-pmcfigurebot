figure_title: The effect of bhlh1, bhlh2, and bhlh1bhlh2 knock-out on properties related
  to drought response.
caption: The effect of bhlh1, bhlh2, and bhlh1bhlh2 knock-out on properties related
  to drought response. Properties in panels a and b were in plants subjected to mannitol
  osmotic stress; properties in panels c to g were measured on leaves of pot-grown
  plants that were subjected to drought by withholding water for 7 days. (a) germination
  and growth of bhlh1, bhlh2, and bhlh1bhlh2 in control and mannitol medium; (b) germination
  rate of bhlh1, bhlh2, and bhlh1bhlh2 under mannitol treatment; (c) relative water
  content of bhlh1, bhlh2, and bhlh1bhlh2; (d) H2O2 content; (e) MDA content; (f)
  expression of genes in the JA signaling pathway; and (g) gene expression of MYB
  transcription factors. The superscript letters in the table represent the differences
  between different genotypes, and different letters indicate significant differences
