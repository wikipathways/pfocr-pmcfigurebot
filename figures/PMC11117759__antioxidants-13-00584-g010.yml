caption: 'Integrative scheme. Cadmium (Cd) ingresses into the mitochondria and induces
  toxicity and alterations in mitochondrial function, such as the reduction of mitochondrial
  membrane potential (ΔΨm), mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and the increase of
  mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may be attributable to the reduction
  of mitochondrial mass. Conversely, sulforaphane (SFN) can prevent mitochondrial
  alterations by increasing mitochondrial mass through the regulation of the IIS pathway.
  Furthermore, the Cd response gene (CDR-1) could be implicated in Cd protection.
  Ultimately, the effect of SFN on mitochondrial alterations is evidenced by enhanced
  health in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). AGE-1: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase gene protein, CdCl2: cadmium chloride, DAF-16: forkhead box O (FoxO) orthologous
  gene, DAF-2: receptor tyrosine kinase (IGFR) homologous gene protein, P: phosphate
