figure_title: Effect of GPX3 on the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.
caption: Effect of GPX3 on the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. (a) Using Sangerbox 3.0
  tool, we performed GSEA enrichment analysis for GPX3. The results show that GPX3
  is related to mTOR signaling pathway. (b) Specifc mechanism of GPX3 regulation of
  pyrimidine metabolism through AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (picture design by Figdraw).
  (c) The correlation between GPX3 and the expression level of AMPKa1 and mTOR was
  analyzed through TIMER2.0 online database. (d) The effect of GPX3 expression on
  AMPKa1 and mTOR expression in SGC-7901 cells was detected by western blot analysis.
  (e) Laser confocal microscopy was used to show the diference of ROS content between
  the NC-GPX3 group and the OE-GPX3 group. (f) The ROS changes in the NC-GPX3 and
  OE-GPX3 group were quantitatively detected by fuorescent enzyme labeling (∗∗∗∗P
  < 0.0001)
