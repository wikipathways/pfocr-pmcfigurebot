caption: Melatonin can upregulate the expression of the MT2 receptor and activate
  the Nrf2 signaling pathway. (A-D) Representative blots and quantification of the
  protein expression levels of MT2, Nrf2 and Keap1 were assessed in each experimental
  group. (E and F) mRNA levels of Nrf2 and Keap1 were measured in the spinal cord
  tissue of each group at 7 days post-injury. *Pâ‰¤0.05. Nrf2, nuclear factor-erythroid
