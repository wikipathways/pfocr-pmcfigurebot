caption: Impact of sleep deprivation on the metabolome. (A) PLS-DA discriminant analysis
  of the metabolome in blood serum from CTRL and SD females. (B) Volcano map of metabolite
  changes caused by SD. (C) KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. (D) Heatmap
  of metabolites in niacinamide (NAM) metabolic pathways. (E-F) Comparison of the
  relative abundance of NAM and 1-Methylnicotinamide in the metabolome of CTRL and
  SD females. (G) Spearman correlation analysis between NAM and different bacterial
  genera. The red font represents the bacteria genera with significant differences
  shown between CTRL and SD groups.
