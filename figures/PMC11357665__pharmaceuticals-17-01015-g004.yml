figure_title: CA and CDCA ameliorated lipid deposition through the TGR5/AMPK signaling
  pathway.
caption: 'CA and CDCA ameliorated lipid deposition through the TGR5/AMPK signaling
  pathway. HepG2 cells were pre-incubated with 50 μM CA and CDCA for 30 min, and then
  treated without or with 0.2 mM of PA and 0.4 mM of OA for 24 h. (a–d) The content
  of GLU, TC, TG and glycogen. (e) Representative photographs of Oil Red O staining.
  (Scale bar = 25 μm). (f) The mRNA levels of G6Pase, PEPCK, FAS, and SREBP1. (g)
  The relative mRNA levels of TGR5. (h–j) Representative blots and quantification
  of p-AMPK/AMPK and TGR5. Data are represented as mean ± SD (n = 3–6). * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. Ctrl; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001 vs.
  Model. Ctrl, control; CA, cholic acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; GLU, glucose;
  TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglycerides; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; PEPCK,
  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; SREBP1, sterol regulatory
  element-binding protein 1; TGR5, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5; AMPK, adenosine
  monophosphate-activated protein kinase; p-AMPK, phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-actived
  protein kinase'
