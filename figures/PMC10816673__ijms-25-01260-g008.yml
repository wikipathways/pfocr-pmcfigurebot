figure_title: Top 20 KEGG enrichment pathways of DEGs in the comparisons of CKs vs.
caption: 'Top 20 KEGG enrichment pathways of DEGs in the comparisons of CKs vs. Cds
  and CKr vs. Cdr. (a,b): upregulated and downregulated DEGs in CKs vs. Cds. (c,d):
  upregulated and downregulated DEGs in CKr vs. Cdr. The x-axis represents the ratio
  of the number of enriched single genes (sample number) (based on the rich factor)
  to the number of annotated single genes (background number) in the path, and the
  y-axis represents the name of the pathway'
