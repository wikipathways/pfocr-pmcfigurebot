figure_title: 'TERT signaling upon mutation (marked with green), p53 signaling pathway
  (marked with blue), and Wnt-catenin pathway (marked with red) are the typical signaling
  pathways in HCC development. They influence carcinogenesis and development of hepatocellular
  carcinoma by interacting with some common oncogenes and tumor suppressors. These
  tasks involved: proliferation, immortalization, genomic stability, cell differentiation,
  and survival. The ctDNA mutation genes play essential roles in these pathways'
