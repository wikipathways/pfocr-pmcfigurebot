caption: 'Effects of KD (i.e., consuming more fat and protein instead of carbohydrates)
  on the incidence and progression of hepatic conditions, compared to HFD and Chow.
  (A) Images taken from the liver sections (with scale bar = 100 μm), which are stained
  with H&D, cleaved caspase 3, and Gom and mass (for fibrosis). As shown, marked hepatic
  inflammation, ballooning of hepatocytes, and fibrosis are visible in mice fed with
  KD, compared to other treatments. Further, apoptotic hepatocytes can be found in
  KD-fed mice, suggestive of “caspase 3” activation in hepatocytes. (B) Lipid profile
  (i.e., distribution of lipid species in the pool of upregulated lipids, compared
  to the total pool). Under various treatments (i.e., KD vs. HFD vs. Chow), it can
  be seen that triglycerides (TGs) are overrepresented (compared to other species),
  suggestive of marked effect of KD on TGs. (C) Liver sections (stained with oil red
  O or H&S) (scale bar = 100 μm). As depicted, KD can potentially trigger IL-6 and
  JNK signaling pathway, which both are linked with glucose intolerance and HS. (KD:
  ketogenic diet; HFD: high-fat diet, IgG: immunoglobulin G; IL-6Ab: interleukin 6
  antibody) [84]. This content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons
