caption: The activation signal within iNKT cells is attenuated in GATA-3 FFcre mice.
  (A) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results revealed the downregulation of genes
  associated with the T cell receptor signaling pathway in GATA-3 FFcre iNKT cells.
  (B) The enrichment map illustrates the significantly suppressed functions in FFcre
  compared to FF iNKT cells. Nodes represent GO gene sets, while edges indicate shared
  genes between GO gene sets. Node size corresponds to the number of perturbed genes
  within a given gene set. (C) Total thymic iNKT cells from GATA-3 FF and FFcre mice
  exhibit differential expression of TCR (T cell receptor) and CD5. (D) The volcano
  plot highlights genes involved in the T cell receptor signaling pathway that show
  differential expression between GATA-3 FF and FFcre iNKT cells
