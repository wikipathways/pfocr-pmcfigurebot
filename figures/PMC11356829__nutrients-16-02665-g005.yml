figure_title: NAM regulates DC activation through a PARP-dependent NF-κB signaling
  pathway.
caption: 'NAM regulates DC activation through a PARP-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A) RNA expression levels of NAM salvage pathway-related genes in LPS-stimulated
  activated DCs (GSE235310). (B) Schematic illustration of the regulation between
  NAM, PARP, and NF-κB. (C) mRNA expression of Parp3, Parp9, Parp10 and Parp11 in
  vehicle- or LPS-stimulated BMDCs (n = 3). (D) mRNA expression of Cd80 and Cd86 in
  vehicle-, NAM- or PARP inhibitor (Venadaparib)-treated BMDCs after stimulation with
  LPS (n = 3). (Control: without LPS stimulation). (E) mRNA expression of Tnf and
  Il1b in vehicle-, NAM- or Venadaparib-treated BMDCs after stimulation with LPS (n
  = 3). (Control: without LPS stimulation). (F,G) Representative flow overlay histograms
  (F) and statistical analysis (G) of BMDCs treated as indicated and stimulated by
  LPS (n = 3). (H) Fold change for the inhibitory ability of NAM in vehicle- or Venadaparib-treated
  BMDCs (n = 3). Data are presented as means ± SD. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ****
  p < 0.0001. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test'
