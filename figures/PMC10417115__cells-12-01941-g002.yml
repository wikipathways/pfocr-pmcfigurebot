caption: miRNA binding sites at the rs8720 and rs12587 variants of the KRAS gene and
  their function in tumor regulation. (*) miRNA has been experimentally validated;
  it was observed that hsa-miR-4328 regulates genes involved in various cellular signaling
  pathways, such as EFGR, RET/PTC, KRAS, C-JUN, AP1/SP1 in the MAPK pathway and the
  genes ET1 and PTEN in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
