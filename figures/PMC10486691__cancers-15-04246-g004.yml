figure_title: Activation of signaling pathways by EN variants and their potential
  mechanisms in oncogenic transformation.
caption: 'Activation of signaling pathways by EN variants and their potential mechanisms
  in oncogenic transformation. (A) Activation of the ERK pathway, assessed using a
  transcription factor ELK1-responsive luciferase reporter. (B) Western blot quantification
  of ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) phosphorylation levels, 24 h post-induction in generated stable
  cell line lysates, revealing the intensity of ERK phosphorylation across different
  EN variants. (C) Activation of the STAT1 signaling pathway determined using a luciferase
  assay with a STAT1-responsive element. (D) Activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway
  assessed using a luciferase reporter assay with a STAT3-responsive element, indicating
  the potential role of EN variants in STAT3-mediated cellular processes. (E) Assessment
  of the JNK pathway activation by EN variants, using an AP-1-responsive luciferase
  reporter assay. (F) Mass cytometry-derived mean values of phosphorylation activation
  sites of ribosomal protein S6 (S235/S236), STAT1 (Y701), STAT3 (Y705) and STAT5
  (Y694) detected at the single-cell level in stable cell lines, normalized to a control.
  The data show the relative intensity of signaling events initiated by each EN variant.
  The EN2 cell line without tetracycline induction was employed as the reference control
  for the normalization of stable cell line experiments. Luciferase assay column graphs
  individual measurements are shown as black dots and the level of statistical significance
  of the EN variant values compared to NTRK3 values, is denoted by asterisk-symbols:
  * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.005), *** (p < 0.0005), **** (p < 0.00005) or “ns” for not
  significant (p > 0.05). See Supplementary Materials for original Western Blots'
