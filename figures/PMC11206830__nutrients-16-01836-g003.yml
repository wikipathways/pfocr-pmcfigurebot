caption: Moderate-Intensity Exercise Enhances Mitochondrial Biogenesis Independently
  from AMPK/PGC-1α Signaling Pathway. Representative immunoblots of NRF-1 and TFAM
  (a), p-AMPKα (Thr172) and total AMPKα (b), and PGC-1α (c). (d) Densitometry analysis
  of NRF-1; * p < 0.05, Ln + Sed vs. HFS + Ex. (e) Densitometry analysis of TFAM;
  * p < 0.05, HFS + Sed vs. HFS + Ex. (f) Densitometry analysis of p-AMPK (Thr172)
  over total AMPK; *** p < 0.001, Ln + Sed vs. Ln + Ex. (g) Densitometry analysis
  of PGC-1α; no statistical significance was found. Data shown as means ± SEM, n =
  3 per group
