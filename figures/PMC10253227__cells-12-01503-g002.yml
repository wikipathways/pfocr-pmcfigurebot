caption: Functional analysis of screen results highlights the Hippo signaling pathway
  as synthetic viable with ATM dysfunction. (A) KEGG pathway analysis of the 30 genes
  with the highest logFC values. Top 3 results are shown in the graph. (B) Protein–protein
  interaction network of top 30 genes, produced by the STRING database. Interaction
  confidence is indicated by line thickness; disconnected nodes are not shown. Node
  colors were determined by k-means clustering algorithm; dotted lines represent edges
  between clusters. (C) Bar plot demonstrating the relative rank of Hippo pathway-related
  genes and regulators between control and ATMi screen. Genes in each screen were
  ranked according to their logFC. Y axis is represented by logarithmic scale. Genes
  with higher growth effect in the ATMi screen are in dark blue; genes with greater
  effect in the control screen are in bright blue. p = 0.05 in hypergeometric test
