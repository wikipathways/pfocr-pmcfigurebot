caption: Inhibition of EGFR expression and downstream signaling by 35d through hsp70-mediated
  lysosomal degradation in EGFR-mutant LUAD tumors with TKI resistance. A and B, EGFR
  and HSP70 expression in GR6, GR8, and GR10 cells treated with 35d for 24 h were
  determined by Western blot analysis (A). B, quantitation of EGFR and HSP70 expression
  in GR6, GR8, and GR10 cells from (A). Results are expressed relative to total protein.
  Comparisons between each treatment group with its untreated control group were analyzed
  using Student’s t test followed by the Bonferroni correction for three comparisons.
  ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01. C, EGFR expression in H1650, H1975, and HEK293 cells treated
  with 35d for 24 h were determined by Western blot analysis. D, GSEA of RNA-seq data
  as described in A using KOBAYASHI EGFR signaling DN and UP pathway gene sets. E,
  Western blot showing EGFR expression in GR6 and GR10 cells treated with 35d (2 μM)
  and hsp70 inhibitor ver-155008 (ver) and pifithrin (pif) at the indicated concentrations
  (μM) for 24 h. F, fold changes in EGFR, BAG3, HSPBP1, SQSTM1, and STUB1 mRNA levels
  in GR6 cells treated with 35d in RNA-seq data as described in A. G, Western blot
  showing EGFR expression in GR6 and GR10 cells treated with 35d (2 μM) and lysosome
  inhibitors hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), bafilomycinA (bafA) and proteasome inhibitors
  MG132, ixazomib (ixa) at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. H, protein expression
  of EGFR, hsp70, bag3, and p62 analyzed at the indicated time points in GR6 and GR10 cells
  treated with 35d (2 μM). Relative protein levels are indicated below the blot. Total
  protein was used as the loading control. Molecular weight markers are noted next
  to all immunoblots. Quantitation data are from three independent experiments and
  presented as mean ± SD (B). I, model depicting EGFR protein degradation in response
  to 35d treatment. EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; GR, gef-resistant; GSEA,
  gene set enrichment analysis; HSP, heat shock protein; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma;
  TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
