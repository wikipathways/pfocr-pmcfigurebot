caption: 'Schematic representation of the role of the Notch pathway in cell-fate decisions
  in the somite. Myogenic and vascular endothelial cells are derived from the dermomyotome
  comprising bipotent mesodermal myogenic progenitor cells (MPC) that express the
  transcription factors pax3+/pax7+ and foxc2. The myogenicâ€“endothelial cell fate
  of MPC cells is regulated by the Notch signaling pathway via control of the pax3:
  foxc2 genetic equilibrium. From Mayeuf-Louchart et al., 2014 [17]'
