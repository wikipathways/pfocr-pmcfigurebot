figure_title: Functional characterization of prioritized AD keratinocyte-linked gene
  candidates
caption: 1st panel, Keratinocyte subtype differential expression (x axis) by gene
  (y axis). Differential expression values correspond to expression log fold change
  (FC) between keratinocyte and non-keratinocyte cells, mean-averaged across body
  sites, and whiskers represent the standard deviation of the mean. 2nd panel, Differential
  expression (x axis) of gene (y axis) as a function of epidermal raft differentiation.
  Differential expression values correspond to log expression fold change as a function
  of differentiation timepoints (Methods), and whiskers represent the 95% confidence
  interval of the value. 3rd panel, Differential expression of pathway (x axis) proxy
  genes by candidate gene (y axis). Differential expression values correspond to the
  standardized mean difference (SMD) of the expression of genes that are proxies of
  IL-22 and IL-13 pathways between the presence or absence of siRNA targeting corresponding
  gene candidate. Whiskers represent the 95% confidence interval of the value. SMD
  values were derived from across-proxy-genes per-pathway meta-analysis (Methods).
  4th panel, Keratinocyte eQTL effect size (x axis) by candidate gene (y axis), stratified
  by keratinocyte stimulus. Effects are mapped to AD risk alleles of the corresponding
  GWAS locus lead variants. Whiskers represent the 95% confidence interval of the
  value. CEBPA effect size is not shown due to insufficient AD risk allele frequency
