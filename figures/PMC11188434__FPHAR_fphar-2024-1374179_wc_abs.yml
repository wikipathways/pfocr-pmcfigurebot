  cytokines.
caption: GUP can effectively inhibit the activation of cGAS-STING pathway induced
  by multiple stimuli and reduce the expression of type I interferon and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Meanwhile GUP also has a good therapeutic effect on sepsis contributed
  to cecum ligation and puncture
