  landscape of metal transport by Nramps
caption: (A) After Mn2+ enters through the outer vestibule between TM6a and TM10 in
  the outward-open state, a bulk conformation change closes the outer gate. The occluded
  conformation arises though rearrangements of TM6a and TM10 facilitated by formation
  of the T228 and Q378 networks, respectively. The inner gate partially opens in the
  occluded state as the R244 network breaks and TM5 moves. To achieve the inward-open
  conformation, disruption of the Q89 network frees TM1a to swing up to fully open
  the inner vestibule for Mn2+ release into the cytosol. (B) Our data indicate that
  the most stable Mn2+-bound state is the occluded state, and the three main states
  are readily accessible to facilitate transport. In contrast, Cd2+ binding stabilizes
  the inward-open state.
