caption: 'Graphical representation of the effect of the different CBN concentrations
  (5 µM, 10 µM, 20 µM, and 50 µM) on the expression of cell cycle genes after 24 h
  of incubation: (a) Line plot with confidence intervals representing the overall
  effect of the different CBN concentrations on cell cycle pathway genes. The blue
  solid line represents the fold change absolute values’ mean for each concentration,
  while the shaded light blue area around the mean line indicates the 95% confidence
  intervals. Treatment with 20 µM CBN had the highest mean fold change of absolute
  values. (b) Violin plot shows the shape of the distribution of the cell cycle genes’
  fold changes for each tested CBN concentration. Treatment with 20 µM CBN was characterized
  by DEGs with more extreme fold changes than seen with other concentrations'
