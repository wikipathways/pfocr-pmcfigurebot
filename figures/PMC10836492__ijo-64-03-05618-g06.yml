  and H1299 cells.
caption: Knocking down SLCO4A1 inhibits migration and invasion abilities of A549 and
  H1299 cells. (A) The correlation between SLCO4A1 and EMT in angiogenesis pathways.
  (B) Migration assay demonstrated that knockdown of SLCO4A1 inhibits migration ability
  of A549 and H1299 cells. (C) Invasion assay demonstrated that knockdown of SLCO4A1
  inhibits invasion ability of A549 and H1299 cells. (D and E) Wound healing assay
  demonstrated that knocking down SLCO4A1 inhibits migration ability of (D) A549 cells
  and. (E) H1299 cells. (F) Knockdown of SLCO4A1 affects the expression of E-cadherin
  and Vimentin in A549 and H1299 cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. SLCO4A1,
  solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1; si-, small interfering;
  NC, negative control
