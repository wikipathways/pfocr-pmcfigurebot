  1 signalling pathway-associated genes in blood samples from patients with IA and
  controls.
caption: Correlations between macrophage activity and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 signalling
  pathway-associated genes in blood samples from patients with IA and controls. (A)
  Differences in the gene expression levels between healthy controls and patients
  with IA. The colour scale from blue to red represents the process of downregulation
  to upregulation as number of standard deviations from mean expression. (B) Correlations
  of gene expression levels in blood samples from patients with IA and controls. The
  correlation coefficient ranges from -1 (red colour) to +1 (blue colour). The red
  colour represents negative correlations. The blue colour represents positive correlations.
  Larger circles indicate greater correlation. IA, invasive aspergillosis
