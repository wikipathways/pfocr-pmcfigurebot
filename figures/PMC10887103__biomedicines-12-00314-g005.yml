caption: The defective PI3K/Akt pathway in T2DM results in insulin resistance and
  the activation of the pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic inhibition of eNOS and glycogen
  production. Insulin resistance and hyperglycemia hyperactivate the glucocorticoids
  and catecholamines. Glucocorticoids and catecholamines further aggravate T2DM by
  inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway, as indicated by the dotted inhibitory lines, thus
  potentiating insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Glucocorticoids decrease GTP
  cyclohydrolase 1, which is required for NO generation from eNOS; increase ET-1 adhesion
  molecules; and activate NF-kβ, thus resulting in hypertension, endothelial dysfunction,
  and inflammation. These increase the risk of MI. Catecholamines result in Ca2+ overload
  by increasing the phosphorylation of PLN, activating SERCA calcium release, and
  causing leakage of RyR2 and DHPR2 receptors. Ca2+ overload results in mitochondrial
  ROS, contractile dysfunction, and arrhythmias, and these are reported to cause MI.
  Catecholamines also stimulate the release of renin and the activation of RAAS. Hyperactivation
  of the RAAS causes hypertension and increases the risk of MI. The effect of insulin
  resistance and hyperglycemia on opioids is not apparent, but studies have reported
  that opioids are elevated in hyperglycemia. The green arrows indicate that opioids
  activate insulin’s PI3K/Akt pathway, GLUT4 receptor translocation to the membrane,
  and reduced blood glucose. Opioids also inhibit adenylyl cyclase and cAMP, thus
  inhibiting the PKA pathway and its downstream effects. Black ↓ indicates an activation
  or stimulation in the pathway. Red ↓ indicates a decrease. Red ↑ indicates a increase.
  A black solid ┴ indicates an inhibition. X indicates defects in the insulin signaling
  pathway in T2DM. Black dashed lines ending with ┴ show inhibition due to the HPA-axis
  pathway. Brown dashed lines ending with ┴ indicate inhibition due to opioid activation.
  Green arrows illustrate that opioids reduce blood glucose by activating the PI3K/Akt
  pathway
