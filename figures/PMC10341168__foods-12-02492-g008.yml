figure_title: The function of ginsenoside Rh4 on bile acids and FXR signaling pathways.
caption: The function of ginsenoside Rh4 on bile acids and FXR signaling pathways.
  (A) Effects of Rh4 on BAs in mouse liver. (B) ELISA determination of total bile
  acids. (C,D) Western blotting analysis of bile acid receptor FXR and other related
  receptor proteins in vivo. (E) Effects of Rh4 on fecal bile acids. (F) Heatmap of
  the association of fecal bile acids and gut microbiota. (G,H) Western blotting analysis
  of FXR and FGF15 in vivo. The results are the mean ± SD of three standalone experiments.
  All experimental groups were compared with the model group. (* p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, *** p < 0.001). “ns” means that the data results are not significantly different
