caption: The proposed cellular signal transduction pathway of TCBPA-induced cell inflammation
  in Jurkat cells. All genes in the figure were detected in this study. Red indicates
  a significant upregulation, green indicates no obvious change and blue indicates
  a significant downregulation, compared with 0.1% DMSO
