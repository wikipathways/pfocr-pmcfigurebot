caption: 'NRF2 cooperated with TOPBP1 to activate the ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway.
  A Western blotting of p-ATR, TOPBP1, NRF2, ETAA1, and p-CHK1 in A549 cells transfected
  with siNRF2, siTOPBP1, or siETAA1 and then exposed to 8 Gy γ-rays for 8 h. B Western
  blotting of p-ATR, ATR, TOPBP1, HA-NRF2, p-CHK1, and CHK1 in H1299R cells transfected
  with siTOPBP1 and HA-NRF2 and treated with 60 nM CPT for 6 h. C Western blotting
  of p-ATR, ATR, NRF2, Flag-TOPBP1, p-CHK1, and CHK1 in A549 cells transfected with
  siNRF2 and Flag-TOPBP1 and treated with 60 nM CPT for 6 h. D Western blotting of
  TOPBP1 and NRF2 in chromatin and soluble extracts of A549R cells transfected with
  siNRF2 and then exposed to 4 or 8 Gy 137Cs γ-rays for 4 h. E Immunofluorescence
  analysis of TOPBP1 (red) in the DNA damage site (γ-H2AX: green) of A549 and A549-NRF2KO
  cells caused by transfection with Cas/sgHPRT. Scale bar: 10 μm. F Statistics of
  TopBP1 foci intensity. The data are presented as means ± S.E.M. (n > 3). ***P <
  0.001. G Immunofluorescence analysis of TOPBP1 (red) at the site of DNA damage (γ-H2AX:
  green) in A549 cells and A549-NRF2KO cells caused by laser microdissection. Scale
  bar: 100 μm. H Soluble and chromatin extracts of H1299R cells exposed to 8 Gy 137Cs
  γ-rays were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-NRF2 antibody or control
  immunoglobulin G. Western blotting of TOPBP1, ATRIP, and NRF2 in soluble and chromatin
  immunoprecipitated extracts. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean
  (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ns: no significance)'
