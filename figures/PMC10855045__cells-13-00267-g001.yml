caption: Cellular and molecular pathogenesis of GCA. Cells of the innate and adaptive
  immune system and the vascular wall contribute to the pathogenesis of GCA. Adventitious
  dendritic cells are activated by unknown molecules of microbial and/or cellular
  origin. Dendritic cells in GCA are typically defective in the expression of the
  immunosuppressive surface molecule PD-L1, as indicated in the figure by the red
  cross. Dendritic cells produce IL-12, which promotes the differentiation of Th1
  cells, and Il-6 and IL-23, which contribute to the differentiation and stabilization
  of the phenotype of Th17 cells. T lymphocytes are activated by both dendritic cells
  and B lymphocytes through the presentation of a putative antigen. Th1 cells produce
  IFN-γ and GM-CSF, while Th17 cells produce IL-17. These cytokines activate M1 and
  M1 macrophages, which in turn produce MMP-9, IL1-β, and ROS, contributing to media
  destruction. Some macrophages, unable to kill the phagocytosed material, transform
  into giant cells. CD4+ and CD8+ Treg cells participate in the inflammatory reaction,
  being deficient in their immunosuppressive function, as indicated by the stop symbol.
  CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils producing proinflammatory cytokines and NETs
  play an additional role in the pathogenesis of GCA. At the vascular level, damaged
  VSMCs produce VEGF, PDGF, endothelin-1, and MMP-2, which promote their differentiation
  into myofibroblasts. These cells cause thickening of the intima and subsequent vascular
  stenosis. Many cytokines recognize JAK-associated receptors and amplify the inflammatory
  cascade through the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. T and B cells
  aggregate to form tertiary follicular structures (ATLO), whereas T cells and macrophages
  are the main components of granulomas. The light-yellow boxes show the main drugs
  available to date that inhibit the various factors involved in the pathogenesis
  of GCA, as indicated by the thin arrows. Of these, only tocilizumab has been officially
  approved for the treatment of this vasculitis
