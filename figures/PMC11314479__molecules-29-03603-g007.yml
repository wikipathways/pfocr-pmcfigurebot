caption: Rescue effects of the PI3K/AKT pathway activator, 740 Y−P. (A) Changes in
  the expression levels of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-associated proteins, as well as MMP−2
  and MMP−9, were assessed in FaDu and Detroit 562 cells after treatment with fucoxanthin
  for 48 h (Fx; 6 μg/mL) and 740 Y−P (50 μg/mL). The proliferation and metastasis
  of (B) FaDu and (C) Detroit 562 cells, after 48 h of treatment with Fx (6 μg/mL)
  and 740 Y−P (50 μg/mL), were evaluated with EdU and Transwell assays. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01
