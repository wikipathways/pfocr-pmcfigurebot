caption: Growth of ura6 mutants in media containing toxic fluorinated pyrimidine analogs.
  A) Summary comparison of qualitative growth phenotypes across WT, ura3, and ura6
  mutants in YPD, SC-ura, 5-FOA, SC-ura +5-FOA. “+” indicates growth, and “−” indicates
  lack of growth. B) URA6 lies at the junction of the pyrimidine synthesis and salvage
  pathways. The fluorinated drugs 5-FC and 5-FU are incorporated into the pyrimidine
  salvage pathway. 5-FOA is incorporated into the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. The
  production of 5-FdUMP and 5-FUTP from the fluorinated prodrugs leads to toxicity.
  C) Growth curves for three biological replicates of ura6 mutants and wild-type in
  MM, MM+5-FOA, MM+5FC, MM+5FU measured at 30°C. D) Area under the growth curve (AUC)
  measurements for growth for ura6 mutants and wild-type strains grown in MM, MM+5-FOA,
  MM+5FC, MM+5FU measured at 30°C. E) Growth curves for three biological replicates
  of individual ura6 mutants and wild type strains grown in MM at 30°C and 37°C
