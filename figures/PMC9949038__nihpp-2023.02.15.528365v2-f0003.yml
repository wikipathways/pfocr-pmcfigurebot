figure_title: Increased intratumoral heterogeneity in Cracd KO SCLC tumors
caption: 'A, UMAPs of the scRNA-seq datasets of RPR2 and CRPR2 SCLC tumors.B, UMAPs
  of subsets of cells from the global level (left) to SCLC tumor epithelial cells
  (right). Each dot represents a single cell, colored by cell type. Tumor epithelial
  cells (RPR2 and CRPR2) were replotted into another UMAP (right).C, UMAPs of cell
  types within RPR2 (left) and CRPR2 cell subsets (right). The top two genes that
  were highly expressed in each cluster were used for cell cluster annotation of the
  UMAPs.D, Comparison of proportions of different cell types between the RPR2 and
  CRPR2 datasets.E, CytoTRACE scores of RPR2 and CRPR2 datasets were analyzed and
  plotted.F, Boxplots of the cell differentiation potential of each cell cluster based
  on the CytoTRACE score analysis; diff.: cell differentiation; **: P < 0.01; ***:
  P < 0.001.G, GSEA of gene sets associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  pathway and hypoxia pathway in cluster 4 in CRPR2 datasets compared to in RPR2 scRNA-seq
  datasets; NES, normalized enrichment score.H, Feature plots displaying the expression
  of epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker Vim and Fn1, hypoxia marker Hif1a.I,
  Violin (left) and feature (right) plots visualizing Ascl1 and Calca expression between
  RPR2 and CRPR2 datasets'
