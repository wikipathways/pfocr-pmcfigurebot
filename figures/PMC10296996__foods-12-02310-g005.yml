figure_title: Effects of DOP treatment on TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.
caption: Effects of DOP treatment on TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Effect of DOP on
  plasma LPS level (A). The Western blotting results of TLR4, IKKβ, IκBα, p-IκBα,
  and NF-κB p65 in different groups (B1). Grayscale analysis of TLR4 (B2), IKKβ (B3),
  p-IκBα/IκBα (B4), and NF-κB p65 (B5), which were normalized by β-actin. Effect of
  DOP on plasma TNF-α and IL-6 level (C,D). Values are shown as the mean ± SEM. Comparisons
  between groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test.
  A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 vs. mice in the MD group
