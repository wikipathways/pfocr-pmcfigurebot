figure_title: FLT4 knockdown inhibits Notch signaling and expression
caption: (A) qRT-PCR analysis for members of the Notch signaling pathway and other
  putative signaling pathways associated with VEGFR3 in cultured human dermal lymphatic
  endothelial cells.(B) Western blot for VEGFR3, pVEGFR2, VEGFR2, cleaved NOTCH1,
  cleaved NOTCH4, VE-cadherin, and DLL4 to assess activation of these signaling pathways.(C)
  Quantification of the western blot data in (B). **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p
  < 0.0001; ns, non-significant. Student’s unpaired t test. All data are presented
  as mean ± SEM. All experiments were performed n = 3–4 times
