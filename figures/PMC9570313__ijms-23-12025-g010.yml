caption: A Schematic Diagram Developed from the Integration of Differentially Expressed
  Genes (DEGs) and Differentially Accumulated Metabolites (DAMs) in the Phenylpropanoid
  Pathway in Leaves. Three biological control leaf samples (CK-Y1, CK-Y2, and CK-Y3)
  and three biological treated leaf samples (C-Y1, C-Y2, and C-Y3) are coded by three
  squares or rectangles in the order of CK-Y1, CK-Y2, CK-Y3, C-Y1, C-Y2, and C-Y3.
  The six squares or rectangles were used to create heatmaps. The expression levels
  of genes and accumulation levels of metabolites in C-Y1, C-Y2, C-Y3, C-Y1, C-Y2,
  and C-Y3 are coded by colored heatmaps of the six squares or rectangles. PAL, 4CL,
  CCR, CYP98A, and CAD coded with a red color on each arrow mean that their gene expression
  levels are upregulated in the treated leaves. HCT coded by a light blue means that
  its gene expression is reduced. Six metabolite names, which are coded with a red
  color at end of arrows and included together in a heatmap contained in a dashed
  box, mean that their levels are increased in the treated leaves.
