caption: 'Pathways of four central precursors of the TCA cycle intermediates synthesized:
  group (I) includes pathways of glyoxylate formation (some of the reactions of the
  glyoxylate cycle (reactions 1–3, 14, 10–13; here and below the color of the text
  corresponds to the color of reactions on figure); pathways involving Rubisco oxygenase
  activity (reactions 15, 16, and 17 or 18–19 or 20) and the glyoxylate formation
  pathway from glycine formed at one stage of the reductive glycine pathway (reactions
  75,79–82,85); group (II) includes pathways of propionyl-CoA and glyoxylate simultaneous
  formation (Part of methylaspartate cycle reactions (reactions 57–59, 56, 67–68),
  some citramalate cycle reactions (reactions52, 53b, 54b, 55, 56, 67–68) and the
  ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (reactions 60, 61a-62a or 61b-62b, 63–68); group (III)
  includes pathways of propionyl-CoA synthesis (some of the reactions of 3-hydroxypropionate
  and of 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycles (reactions 69, 70 or 70a–70b,
  71–74); group (IV) includes with PA/PEP formation pathways. This group consists
  of subgroups A, B, and C. Subgroup A combines two pathways of PA formation from
  exogenous acetate and CO2: the first pathway involves PA formation through pyruvate
  oxidoreductase (reactions 77); the second pathway involves PA formation involving
  reversible formate dehydrogenase and reversible formate-C-acetyltransferase (reactions 75,
  76); Subgroup B includes the pathway of PA/PEP formation from stored carbohydrates
  (glycogen): the Entner–Doudoroff pathway (reactions 45–48) and the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas
  pathway (reactions 40, 39, 27/78, 26, 25, 24, 23, 51, 50, 49); reactions of glycogen
  decomposition to β-d-fructose-6-phosphate (reactions 37–38, 39 (or 40a, 41–43, or
  43–44)) and to β-d-Glucose-6-phosphate (reactions 37, 38, 40a, 41–42 (or 43)). Subgroup
  C includes the PA/PEP formation pathway from CO2: the PA/PEP formation pathway (through
  serine) from glycine synthesized in the reductive glycine pathway (reaction 75,79–84);
  and PEP/PA formation from the CBB cycle intermediates (reactions 21–32, 51, 50,
  49). The scheme is based on the KEGG Pathway database and pertinent literature analyzed.
  The functional numbers of enzymes and the description of each function according
  to KEGG Orthology are presented in the tables under the same number as the catalyzed
  reaction illustrated in this figure.'
