caption: Prediction of the differential function of bacterial communities between
  DINO (blue haze) and N−DINO (orange) groups in KEGG categories at level 1 (a) and
  level 2 (b). Gene functions were predicted from 16S rRNA gene−based microbial compositions
  using the PICRUSt algorithm to make inferences from KEGG annotated databases. Relative
  signal intensity was normalized by the number of the genes for each indicated metabolic
  pathway. *, **, *** indicate the difference is at a significant level with p < 0.05,
  p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively.
