caption: 'Gut microbial derived 12,13-diHOME exposure in context of airway allergen
  stimulation induces pathways related to inflammatory polarization and epigenetic
  modifications. (a) Principal components analysis of the normalized expression for
  all genes between mice treated with and without the combinatorial 3 epoxide hydrolase
  (3EH)-expressing E. coli and cockroach antigen (CRA) distinguishes the four treatment
  groups: no treatment (vehicle; red), 3EH alone (green), CRA alone (blue), and the
  combination of 3EH + CRA (purple). PC1 and PC2 were significantly associated with
  the four 3EH and CRA treatment groups (ANOVA, p = 4.9 × 10−5 and 5.8 × 10−4, respectively).
  (b) Five upregulated GSEA pathways after treatment with combinatorial 3EH + CRA
  compared with vehicle-group. (c) IL-1 signaling pathway. (d) One-carbon metabolism
  pathway. Genes in orange and blue show relatively higher and lower expression in
  mice treated with 3EH + CRA combinatorial group, respectively. NES, normalized enrichment
