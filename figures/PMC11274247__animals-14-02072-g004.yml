caption: Effects of TGF-β1 treatment on the expression levels of TGF-β/BMP signaling
  pathway-related proteins and proliferation in yak PASMCs. (A–E) Western blot analysis
  of the expression levels of TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway-related proteins after treatment
  with various concentrations of TGFβ1 (2.5, 5, 10 ng/mL), with a densitometric analysis
  performed using ImageJ. (F,G) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of
  PCNA after treatment with various concentrations of TGFβ1 (2.5, 5, 10 ng/mL), with
  a densitometric analysis performed using ImageJ. ** p < 0.01, ns indicates insignificant
  differences
