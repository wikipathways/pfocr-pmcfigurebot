caption: 'ADE in complement receptor-expressing cells: the virus-antibody complex
  activates the complement system first by interaction with C1q, followed by activation
  of C2a and C4b, and finally the production of the C3 convertase, which is the conversion
  point of all three complement pathways, viz., classical, lectin, and alternative
  complement activation pathways. The hydrolysis of the C3 produces C3b, interacts
  with the virus, and complements the receptor on the cell. Finally, the figure shows
  the lysis of the cell and enhanced disease pathology'
