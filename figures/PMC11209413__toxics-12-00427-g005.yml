caption: The expression levels of the calcium signaling pathway genes in zebrafish
  larvae exposed to esketamine at 72 hpf. (A) ryr2a, (B) ryr2b, (C) atp2a2a, (D) atp2a2b,
  (E) slc8a3, (F) slc8a4a, and (G) cacna1aa. The expression values of these genes
  were normalized using gapdh. The evaluation of the data was carried out using Tukey’s
  multiple comparisons test, and the findings are represented as the mean ± SEM (n
  = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001
