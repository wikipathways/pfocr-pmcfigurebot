figure_title: TMEM97 stimulation of ERα activation and tamoxifen resistance can be
  blocked by mTOR signaling inhibitor.
caption: TMEM97 stimulation of ERα activation and tamoxifen resistance can be blocked
  by mTOR signaling inhibitor. (A). Immunoblot detection of p-ERα S167 in MCF7-PCDH/TMEM97
  cells with or without 10 µM E2 treatment for 5 h. Cells were first cultured in phenol
  red-free medium supplied with 0.5% CS-FBS for 24 h and then proceeded to treatment.
  (B). Responsiveness to tamoxifen treatment of PCDH and TMEM97. Cells were serum
  and estrogen deprived for 24 h prior to 4 days of culture in E2 10 µM and increasing
  concentrations of OH-Tam as indicated. (C). Immunoblot for phosphorylation of mTOR/S6K1
  signaling pathway (left) and phosphorylation of other different signaling pathways
  in MCF7-PCDH and MCF7-TMEM97 cells. (D). Effects of mTOR inhibitor rapamycin on
  PCDH and TMEM97 cell. Cells were cultured in phenol red-free medium supplied with
  0.5% CS-FBS for 24 h then treated with rapamycin for 5 h with indicated concentrations
  and examined for p-ERα (S167) and p-S6K1 (T389) by immunoplot. The results represent
  the mean ± S.D. of each experiment performed in quadruplicate. ***, p < 0.001 by
  two-tailed paired Student’s T test. The original Western blots file can be found
