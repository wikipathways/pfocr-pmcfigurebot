figure_title: 'Metabolism plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes. This
  schematic shows the essential role of metabolism in regulating various cellular
  processes. It highlights key metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, DNA synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, glutamine metabolism, and ion regulation.
  These pathways are critical for the proper functioning and maintenance of cells.
  Understanding the intricate connections and regulation of these metabolic processes
  is crucial for studying cellular physiology and developing innovative approaches
  for therapeutic interventions. ATP: adenosine triphosphate, ROS: reactive oxygen
