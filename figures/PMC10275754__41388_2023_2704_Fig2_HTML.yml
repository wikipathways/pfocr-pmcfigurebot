figure_title: Transcriptome-wide m6A landscape under hypoxic conditions
caption: A The top enriched motifs within m6A peaks in PANC-1 cells under either normoxic
  (20% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. B Pie charts showing the m6A peak distribution
  in different RNA regions (CDS, 5′UTR, 3′UTR and stop codon) in PANC-1 cells under
  normoxia or hypoxia. C MAplot showing the numbers of m6A peaks under hypoxic (1%
  O2) or normoxic (20% O2) conditions. D GO enrichment map of differentially expressed
  m6A-containing genes between hypoxic and normoxic PANC-1 cells. E KEGG pathway analysis
  of m6A-hypo or m6A-hyper genes in response to hypoxia (1% O2).
article_title: m6A methylation regulates hypoxia-induced pancreatic cancer glycolytic
  metabolism through ALKBH5-HDAC4-HIF1α positive feedback loop.
