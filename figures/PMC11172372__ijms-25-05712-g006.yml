  pathway.
caption: MiR-30b-5p-negative regulation of the CRFB5-mediated JAK/STAT signal pathway.
  (A) Following the co-transfection of EPC cells with the expression plasmid pCDNA3.1-CRFB5
  and either the STAT1 or IRSE luciferin reporter plasmid, along with miR-30b-5p or
  NC at 48 h, cells were activated with poly (I:C) for 6 h, and luciferase activity
  was measured. (B) Silver carp HKCs were transfected with miR-30b-5p or NC and miR-30b-5p-i
  or NC-i for 48 h. Cells were then activated with poly (I:C) for 6 h, and Western
  blotting was performed to determine the levels of phosphorylated TYK2 (P-TYK2) and
  CRFB5 protein expression. (C) Model schematic of the regulatory role of miR-30b-5p
  in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway via targeting CRFB5. Data are presented as means
  Â± SD (n = 3). Significance is shown as *, p < 0.05 **, p < 0.01 in comparison to
  the controls
