figure_title: FUT6 inhibits EMT and the activation of the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway
  in ESCA cells.
caption: 'FUT6 inhibits EMT and the activation of the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway in
  ESCA cells. (A) Western blotting of the expression levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin,
  Vimentin proteins in TE-1 and OE-19 cells, transfected with oe-FUT6 or sh-FUT6#2,
  respectively. (B) Western blotting of the protein levels of p-EGFR, EGFR, p-ERK1/2,
  and ERK1/2 proteins in TE-1 and OE-19 cells, transfected with oe-FUT6 or sh-FUT6#2,
  respectively. Data: mean ± SEM. N = 3. **P < .01, ***P < .001 vs. oe-NC or sh-NC
  group'
