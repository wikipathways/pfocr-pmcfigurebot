caption: Cell wall involvement in pea RSA growth. (A) Venn diagram of the DEGs associated
  with the “plant cell wall synthesis” pathway. (B) Heat map of the expression of
  the key genes for lignin synthesis. (C) Heat map of the DEGs regulating the cell
  wall relaxation factors. (D) Lignin content. Different lower-case letters are the
  results of significance analyses of Duncan’s multiple range test, indicating statistically
  significant differences (p < 0.05). What is compared here is the significance between
  different treatments at all times. (E) Resorcinol lignin staining. Sections of 72-h
  pea primary roots were taken and stained with resorcinol, then quickly placed under
  a light microscope (×100) to observe the degree of lignin accumulation. The darker
  the color, the greater the lignin accumulation. The black arrows point to layers
  of cells where lignin accumulates more
