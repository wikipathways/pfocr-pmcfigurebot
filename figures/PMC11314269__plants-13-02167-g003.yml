caption: Gene ontology (GO) analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of genes
  in Akimeki by SS and HS2 inoculation. (a,b) Enriched GO biological process category
  of 1524 up-regulated DEGs following SS inoculation and 513 up-regulated DEGs following
  HS2 inoculation. The size and color depth of the circles represent the number of
  DEGs. (c) Enrichment plot for genes related to the defense responses (GO:0006952~defense
  response, GO:2000022~regulation of jasmonic acid-mediated signaling pathway). (d)
  Enrichment plot for genes related the water transport (GO:0006833~water transport).
  GSEA rank was calculated by HS2 vs. REST (Mock and SS). The green line indicates
  the enrichment profile
