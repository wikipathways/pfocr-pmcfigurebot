caption: GSEA plot showing the most significantly enriched pathways using the KEGG
  database. The most significantly enriched pathways were (A) the first most significantly
  enriched pathway was TNF signaling pathway; (B) the second was IL-17 signaling pathway;
  (C) the third was NOD-like receptor pathway; and (D) the fourth was chemokine signaling
  pathway
