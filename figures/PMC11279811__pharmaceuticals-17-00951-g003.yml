caption: LGMN induces polarization of macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype by forming
  a complex with Integrin αvβ3. (A) Western blot analysis of the effect of rh-LGMN,
  rh-LGMN + Integrin αv antibody, and rh-LGMN + Integrin β3 antibody on mTORC2 activity
  in M1 macrophages. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of the effect of rh-LGMN, rh-LGMN
  + Integrin αv antibody, and rh-LGMN + Integrin β3 antibody on the polarization of
  macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype. (C) Establishment of M1 macrophage cells derived
  from THP-1 cells with knockdown of Integrin β3 using lentivirus. (D) Flow cytometry
  analysis of the effect of knocking down Integrin β3 expression on LGMN-mediated
  polarize macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype. (E) Stimulation of M1 macrophages
  derived from PBMCs with rh-LGMN protein for 48 h followed by Western blot analysis
  to detect changes in mTORC2 signaling pathway activity. (F) Stimulation of M1 macrophages
  derived from healthy human PBMCs with rh-LGMN for 48 h followed by flow cytometry
  to detect changes in CD36 expression
