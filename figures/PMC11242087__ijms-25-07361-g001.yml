caption: The efficiency of knockdown after injection of dsRNA against ERK, JNK and
  p38 MAPK in vivo. (A–C) sqPCR results showing the mRNA levels of ERK, JNK and p38
  MAPK after knockdown. (A′–C′) Analysis of the mRNA level of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK
  in the interference groups by ImageJ2 v2.15.0. (D–F) Western blotting results showing
  the protein levels of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK in the knockdown groups. (D′–F′) Analysis
  of protein levels by ImageJ2 after MAPK signaling pathway knockdown. * p < 0.05
  indicates a significant difference between two groups; ** p < 0.01 indicates an
  extremely significant difference; *** p < 0.001 indicate an extremely significant
  difference. ‘ns’ indicates that there was no significant change
