figure_title: TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ influx is involved in the inhibition of the AKT-mTOR
  pathway in response to cisplatin.
caption: TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ influx is involved in the inhibition of the AKT-mTOR
  pathway in response to cisplatin. Intracellular Ca2+ signals indicated by the fluorescence
  of Fluo-4 AM in cisplatin (CP, 20 μM) or normal saline (NS) treated Trpm2-/- and
  WT MEFs (A, B) and mRTECs (C, D) (n = 7). Scale bars, 20 μm and 10μm, respectively.
  (E) Immunoblotting analysis and quantification of LC3B II in WT MEFs after incubation
  with clotrimazole (CLT, 10 μM) or vehicle (Veh) for 1 h followed by treatment with
  CP at the indicated concentration for 24 h. (F) Immunoblotting analysis and quantification
  of LC3B II in WT MEFs after incubation with 5 μM BAPTA-AM for 1 h followed by treatment
  with 20 μM CP for 24 h. (G) Immunoblotting analysis and quantification of p-AKT,
  AKT and p-p70S6K in WT MEFs after incubation with 5 μM BAPTA-AM or 10 μM clotrimazole
  for 1 h followed by treatment with 20 μM CP for 24 h. (H, I) Mitochondrial Ca2+
  signals indicated by the fluorescence of Rhod-2 in mRTECs treated by CP or NS (n
  = 7). Scale bars, 10 μm. (J) Immunoblotting analysis and quantification of BNIP3
  and PINK1 in mRTECs treated by CP or NS. Data are presented as mean±SEM. Statistical
  analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test. ns, not significant;
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
