caption: Expression analysis of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
  pathway during response to mechanical wounding in Aquilaria sinensis. FPKM values
  of the individual genes were normalized across the rows and the heatmap was visualized
  in R. Each row represents the normalized gene expression level of individual gene
  and each column represents the expression level from different samples (in order
  represented in the horizontal scale). PAL, phenylalanine ammonia−lyase; C4H, cinnamate
  4−hydroxylase; 4CL, 4−coumarate CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl−CoA reductase; COMT,
  caffeic acid O−methyltransferase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; F5H, ferulate
  5−hydroxylase; CSE, caffeoylshikimate esterase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl−CoA O−methyltransferase
