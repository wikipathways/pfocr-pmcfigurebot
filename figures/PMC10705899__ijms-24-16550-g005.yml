figure_title: Reconstruction of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway.
caption: 'Reconstruction of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. (A) Phenylpropane
  metabolic pathway map; the relative content of the metabolite is indicated by the
  colored cells below it, where the redder the cells are, the higher the quantity
  is. (B) Expression of related genes in the phenylpropane pathway according to FPKM
  values. PAL: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, C4H: cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, 4CL: 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase, CMOT: caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, CHS: chalcone synthase, CHI: chalcone
  isomerase, F3H: flavanone-3-hydroxylase, F3′H: flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase'
