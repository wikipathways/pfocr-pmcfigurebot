caption: Metabolite molecular network of differentially expressed plant hormones in
  wheat roots between well-watered (WW) and soil-drying (SD) conditions. Green dots
  represent metabolic pathways, and other dots represent metabolite molecules. The
  size of each metabolic pathway point represents the number of metabolite molecules
  connected to it; the greater the number, the larger the point. Metabolite molecular
  points indicate the size of log2Fold Change values through gradual color changes,
  and multiple groups with no metabolite log2Fold Change information are compared
