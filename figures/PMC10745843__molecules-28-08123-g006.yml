  PAE treatment upregulated FSHR/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway in ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells. (A) The expressions of aromatase, FSHR, PKAc, and p-CREB/CREB in KGN cells were detected by using Western blot. (Bâ€“E) Each immunoreaction band of aromatase, FSHR, PKAc, and p-CREB/CREB was normalized against GAPDH. (F) Relative level of cAMP in KGN cells. All data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 vs. Con group; #
  p < 0.05, ##
