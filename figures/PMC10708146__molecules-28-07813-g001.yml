caption: The activation, pore formation, and repair mechanism of GSDMD. The activation
  of GSDMD is mainly divided into canonical, noncanonical, and other dependent pathways.
  The canonical pathway depends on caspase-1 via canonical inflammasomes; the noncanonical
  pathway depends on caspase-4/5/11 via lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while other pathways
  mainly depend on caspase-8. When stimulated by an external signal, these proteases
  cleave and activate GSDMD. GSDMDNT can then translocate to the plasma membrane and
  mitochondria and assemble into transmembrane pores. At the same time, activated
  forms of IL-1Î² and IL-18 are released through GSDMD pores to induce pyroptosis.
  Ca2+ influx can trigger the formation of the ESCRT complex and also promote caspase-7
  and ASM to meet in the extracellular space, thereby initiating the membrane repair
  process
