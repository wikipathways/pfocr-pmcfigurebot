figure_title: GMI treatment alleviates inflammaging in diabetes-associated periodontitis
  through the activation of the Nrf2 pathway.
caption: GMI treatment alleviates inflammaging in diabetes-associated periodontitis
  through the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. (A) Both periodontitis and diabetes
  stimuli result in cellular senescence and the development of SASP in HGFs. These
  lead to hindered wound healing and persistent inflammation of the periodontal tissue.
  Conversely, GMI treatment can inhibit HGFs from undergoing cell senescence by activating
  the Nrf2 signaling pathway. GMI decreases SASP, improves wound healing, and ultimately
  alleviates diabetic periodontitis. (B) The diagram illustrates that GMI treatment
  increases the expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1 in cells, which subsequently inhibit
  the rise in ROS and NF-κB pathway. Surge of intracellular ROS and NF-κB activation
  are known to be induced by AGEs and LPS from P. gingivalis through RAGE and TLRs,
  respectively. Elevated ROS and active NF-κB lead to the expression of the senescence
  gene (e.g., p16) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and IL-8), resulting
  in elevated cellular senescence and SASP phenotype. These ultimately lead to inflammaging
  and impair the wound-healing capacity of HGFs. On the other hand, the addition of
  GMI subsequently inhibits the SASP of HGFs, reduce tissue inflammaging and restore
  wound-healing capacity in DP. This could be a promising new approach for alleviating
  periodontitis associated with diabetes. HGFs, human gingival fibroblasts; SASP,
