figure_title: Identification of key hub genes.
caption: 'Identification of key hub genes. The gene–pathway and protein–protein interaction
  network analyses were conducted to find key hub genes, if any. (a) An interacting
  network among the significant pathways and the DEGs was created using Cytoscape.
  The network comprised 60 nodes and 115 edges. (b) The up- and down-regulated 13
  hub genes identified by the Cytohubba plugin of Cytoscape through DEG PPI network
  identified by STRING. (c) The PPI network of 13 hub genes differentially expressed
  between CTRL and MMTV phenotype was constructed using STRING with default settings.
  (d) By combining the outcomes from (a,b) analyses, 50 DEGs were selected as potential
  candidates for hub genes. STRING divided them into 2 groups by means of k-means
  clustering (Cluster 1: red, Cluster 2: green). For STRING networks, the turquoise
  lines show known interactions from curated databases, the pink lines show experimentally
  determined interactions, and the yellow, black, and light blue lines show text-mining,
  co-expression, and protein homology interactions, respectively. The green, red,
  and blue lines show predicted interaction among gene neighborhoods, gene fusions,
  and gene co-occurrence, respectively. The dotted lines show interaction between
  two clusters. (e) The MCODE module of Cytoscape resulted in 12 most interconnected
  genes that were selected as key hub genes'
