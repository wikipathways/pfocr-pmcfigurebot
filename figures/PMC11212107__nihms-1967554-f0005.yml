figure_title: Fat-body-derived Upd2 regulates JAK/STAT signaling in sweet sensory
  neurons
caption: '(A) A schematic of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Dome is activated by
  three ligands: Upd1, Upd2, and Upd3. Stat92E is a downstream transcription factor.(B)
  Confocal images of the adult labellum from 10xSTAT92E-GFP flies fed CD and HFD.
  Gr64f sweet sensory neurons appear in magenta, and GFP appears in green.(C) Relative
  fluorescence intensity of 10x STAT92E-GFP from the experiments in (B); n = 24 and
  21, respectively.(D) Representative confocal images of taste sensilla of ppl-Gal4>Upd-IR;
  10xTAT92E-GFP flies on CD and HFD; GFP appears in green.(E) Relative fluorescence
  intensity of labella of ppl-Gal4>Upd-IR; 10xTAT92E-GFP on CD and respective HFD.
  Data represent mean ± SD. Scale bars, 5 μm. Statistical analysis was performed using
  two-tailed Mann-Whitney tests. *p < 0.05'
