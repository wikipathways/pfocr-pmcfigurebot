  Diabetes and Its Comorbidities
caption: 'The mechanisms of metformin (by itself or with luteolin) and liraglutide
  detoxifying the liver through the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway, as well as the mechanisms
  of CCl4 and methotrexate inducing liver toxication by inhibiting the Nrf2/Keap1
  signaling pathway: pCREB, phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein;
  Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2â€“related factor 2; Keap1, Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1'
