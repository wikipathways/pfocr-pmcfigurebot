caption: Key genes, metabolic pathways, and biological processes impacted or not by
  Imidazolopiperazine (IPZ) GNF179 (100 nM) treatment in P. falciparum Dd2 wild-type
  and its mutant parasites resistant to IPZ. (a) Genes down regulated in dying wild-type
  (WT) parasites that were upregulated in surviving mutant (B3_Pfact), (B6_Pfugt),
  (D6_Pfcarl) parasites resistant to IPZ; (b) volcano plot display GNF179 impact on
  transcriptomic profile between each treated and its untreated homologue parasites.;
  (c) key metabolic pathways affected by GNF179 (100 nM) exposure in WT parasites
  only not in mutant (B3_Pfact), (B6_Pfugt), (D6_Pfcarl) parasites resistant to IPZ;
  (d) Cellular components, biological process and molecular function disturbed by
  GNF179 (100 nM) exposure in wild-type GNF179 (100 nM) treated (WTT) as compared
  to not treated (WTNT)
