caption: Mechanistic diagram depicting the role of NQO1 in GBM cell aggressiveness
  via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/Snail pathway. NQO1 could promote GBM aggressiveness by activating
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway via blocking Snail degradation. NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone
  acceptor oxidoreductase 1; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; 4EBP1, eIF4E-binding protein;
  S6, ribosomal protein S6; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin
