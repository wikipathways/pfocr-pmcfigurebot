caption: 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) enhances oxidative
  stress and atherosclerosis progression. (1) SARS-CoV-2 structure. (2) SARS-CoV-2
  viruses facilitate oxidative stress and inflammation in the arterial intima. Native
  C-reactive protein (nCRP), a marker of severe SARS-CoV-2 produced in liver, macrophages,
  lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells (SMC) and other cells, promotes inflammation through
  monomeric CRP (mCRP) enhancing intimal oxidative stress. SARS-CoV-2 binds macrophage
  toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and facilitates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADP)H oxidase 2 (Nox2) activity and superoxide (O2–) production causing cysteine
  oxidation, disulfide bridge formation and S-glutathionylation. Xanthine oxidase
  (XO) and inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase further facilitate O2–
  cellular activity. SARS-CoV-2 can bind TLRs 2 and 4 and activate transcription factors
  like nuclear factor (NF)-κB facilitating cytokine storm and hyperinflammation. Excessive
  mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation further enhances cytokine
  production. CRP (nCRP, mCRP) can facilitate macrophage and neutrophil uptake of
  SARS-CoV-2-infected apoptotic cells through Fcγ and Fcα receptors, respectively
  (FcRs). Oxidative stress also activates the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1
  (Keap1)-Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response
  element (ARE) redox regulator pathway in monocytes [see (3) and macrophages (2)],
  releasing Nrf2 to regulate the expression of genes that control antioxidant enzymes
  like glutathione S-transferase (GST), facilitating glutathione (GSH) activity. Macrophages,
  T-lymphocytes, neutrophils and SMCs can generate mCRP increasing inflammation. (3)
  Monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial cells and microparticles can generate
  mCRP, increase superoxide (O2–) and ROS formation and reactive nitrogen species
  like peroxinitrite (ONOO–), and tissue factor (TF) expression enhancing oxidation,
  inflammation and thrombosis. TLR 4-mediated SARS-CoV-2-binding to platelets promotes
  thrombosis, mCRP binding to lipid rafts and FcγRs enhances inflammation and endothelial
  activation allows intimal cell migration. (4) Foam cells and smooth muscle cells
  associated with atherosclerotic plaques enhance ROS formation, cytokine release
  and tissue factor (TF)-mediated fibrin deposition. Abbreviations: MAPK/ERK, mitogen-activated
