figure_title: gCTRP3 activates the AMPK/SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.
caption: gCTRP3 activates the AMPK/SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Expression levels
  of proteins associated with the AMPK/SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway were determined
  in MC3T3-E1 cells following treatment with different concentrations of gCTRP3. *P<0.05
  and ***P<0.001 vs. Control group. gCTRP3, globular C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related
  protein 3; p-, phosphorylated; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; SIRT1, sirtuin
  1; Nrf2, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2
