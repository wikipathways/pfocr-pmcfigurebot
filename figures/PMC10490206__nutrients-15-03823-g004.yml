caption: Maternal obesity exacerbates offspring vasculitis through NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (A) The expression of phosphor-p65 protein in the nuclei of cardiomyocytes
  of OB-CAWS group was increased compared to other groups, and that the expression
  levels of cleaved caspase-3 in both the OB-CAWS group and WT-CAWS group were higher
  than that of the WT group and the OB group. (B) Quantitative analysis of protein
  expression indicated that the expression levels of phosphor-p65 in the WT-CAWS group,
  OB group, and OB-CAWS group were higher than those in WT group. And two-way ANOVA
  demonstrated that both KD-like vasculitis and OB promoted the expression of phospho-p65,
  and the interaction between the two variables had no effect on the level of this
  protein. (C) The expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 in both WT-CAWS group and
  OB-CAWS group were higher than that of the WT group and OB group, two-way ANOVA
  demonstrated that only KD-like vasculitis affected the expression of cleaved caspase-3,
  while OB and the interaction between OB and KD-like vasculitis had no effect on
  the expression of cleaved caspase-3. ns, not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
