  pathway.
caption: Ginkgetin alleviated DCD donor liver damage through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway. (A) Protein levels of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3, and STAT3 in the livers of
  each group were evaluated by western blot. (B) Statistical analysis of p-JAK2/JAK2
  and p-STAT3/STAT3 protein expression. Data are expressed as meanÂ±SD, * P<0.05 and
  ** P<0.01. n=3 per group. All statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad
  Prism 8.0.1 software (San Diego, CA, USA). The grayscale values of the western blot
  bands were analyzed using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Maryland,
  USA)
