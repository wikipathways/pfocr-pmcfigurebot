figure_title: GPR19 expression level alteration reveals a progressive response system
  associated with aging-induced cellular pathology.
caption: GPR19 expression level alteration reveals a progressive response system associated
  with aging-induced cellular pathology. The relative numbers of up− or down-regulated
  proteins significantly changed in cells in response to the dose-range of ectopic
  GPR19 expression (A). Protein expression bars indicated in red indicate upregulation
  in response to GPR19 expression; downregulated proteins are indicated by green bars.
  Applying Kolmogorov−Smirnoff-based pathway enrichment analysis to each of the distinct
  dose-dependent GPR19 response datasets revealed a strong phenotypic diversity in
  the molecular response to the GPR19 perturbation. Positively stimulated pathways
  (populated by upregulated proteins) are indicated in red, while negatively stimulated
  pathways (populated by downregulated proteins) are indicated in green. At the lowest
  expression level (0.5 μg–(B)), glucose and adipose regulatory pathways are dominant.
  At the next expression level (1 μg–(C)), ameliorative responses to oxidative stressors
  are observed. At the median expression level in the expression range (2 μg–(D)),
  the implication of GPR19 in oncological pathways is demonstrated. At the next level
  of GPR19 perturbagen expression (5 μg–(E)), DNA damage/telomere protective activity
  is observed. At the highest level of GPR19 expression (10 μg–(F)), responses to
  critical levels of cell stress are observed that may be linked to final cell fate
  decisions in the aging/damage process
