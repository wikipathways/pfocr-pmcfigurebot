figure_title: Hyperactive cAMP signaling in the NAc of Cry1Δ11 mice
caption: '(A) Gene expression in the NAc of WT and Cry1Δ11 mice as assayed by RNA-Seq.
  (B) Volcano plot depicting the relative mRNA abundance in the NAc of Cry1Δ11 mice
  compared with that of WT controls. Upregulated immediate early genes are indicated.
  (C) KEGG pathway analysis on differentially expressed genes. The cAMP signaling
  pathway is indicated with an arrow. (D) Schematic diagram showing the cAMP signaling
  pathway. (E–G) Representative IBs and quantification of lysates from the NAc of
  WT and Cry1Δ11 mice taken during ZT02–04 or ZT14–16. c-Fos and p-CREB levels were
  significantly increased in the NAc of Cry1Δ11 mice. Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM. n = 4 mice/genotype/time point. (F) Genotype: F (1, 12) = 290.1; (G) Genotype:
  F (1, 12) = 12.27; ****P < 0.0001, **P < 0.01, 2-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
  t test. (H and I) Representative immunofluorescence images and quantification of
  c-Fos–positive neurons in the NAc of WT and Cry1Δ11 mice taken during ZT02–04 or
  ZT14–16. Scale bar: 10 μm. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. n = 4 mice/genotype/time
  point; Genotype F (1, 16) = 11.80; **P < 0.01, 2-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
  t test'
