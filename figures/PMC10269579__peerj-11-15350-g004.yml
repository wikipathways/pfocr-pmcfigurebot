figure_title: Analysis of gene expression profiles associated with DNA double-strand
  break repair processes in SiSPTNBC Groups 1–4
caption: '(A) Heatmap demonstrates DSB repair-related gene expression from the SiSPTNBC
  samples. The genes on the y-axis were grouped according to their associated pathways.
  The SISPTNBC samples on the x-axis were grouped with annotated PAM50 subtypes. (B)
  Box plots compared the expressions of genes in a homologous recombination repair
  (HRR) pathway between the four SiSPTNBC groups. (C) Box plots compared the expressions
  of genes in Fanconi anemia pathway between the four SiSPTNBC groups. (D) Box plots
  compared the expression of a gene in a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway
  between the four SiSPTNBC groups. (E) Box plots compared the expressions of genes
  in cell cycle regulation between the four SiSPTNBC groups. The p-values of global
  and independent analyses were calculated by the Kruskal–Wallis test and the one-sided
  Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, respectively (not significant (ns): p > 0.05, ∗, p ≤ 0.05,
  ∗∗, p ≤ 0.01, and ∗∗∗, p ≤ 0.001).'
