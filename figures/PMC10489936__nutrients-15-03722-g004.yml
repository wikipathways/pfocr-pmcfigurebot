figure_title: Polysaccharides modulate liver bile acids (BAs)-related signaling pathways
  of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).
caption: 'Polysaccharides modulate liver bile acids (BAs)-related signaling pathways
  of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Polysaccharides impact the
  bile acid regulation in the liver: The secondary bile acids stimulate the surface
  TGR5 receptor on Kupffer cells, reducing pro-inflammatory factors and alleviating
  liver inflammation. Primary bile acids trigger the nuclear receptor FXR in hepatocytes
  to enhance the β-oxidation of fatty acids by up-regulating the expression of PPARα,
  inhibiting the expression of SREBP-1c through the SHP, thereby reducing fatty acid
  synthesis. By attenuating the binding between weakened FGF15/19 molecules from the
  intestines and the FGFR4/β-Klotho receptor complex, polysaccharides alleviate the
  inhibition of CYP7A1 and promote cholesterol conversion to bile acids. In addition,
  polysaccharides on the one hand bind to its’ autoreceptor, increasing CYP7A1 expression
  through the activation of the AMPK-LXR signaling pathway, on the other hand, down-regulate
  cholesterol synthesis through the AMPK-SREBP-2-HMGR related signaling pathway, reducing
  BAs absorption related transporters NTCP and OATP while increasing excretion related
  transporter BSEP. Abbreviations: BAs, bile acids; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; LXR,
  liver X receptor; TGR5, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5; FGF15/19, fibroblast
  growth factor 15/19; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; FGFR4,
  fibroblast growth factor receptor 4; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; SHP, recombinant small heterodimer partner; SREBP-1c, Sterol regulatory
  element-binding protein 1C; SREBP-2, Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2;
  HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; NTCP, Na+-taurocholate co-transporting
  polypeptide; OATP, organic anion transport protein; BSEP, bile salt export pump.
