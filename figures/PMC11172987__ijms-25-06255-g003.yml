figure_title: Caspase-dependent apoptosis may occur via the intrinsic or extrinsic
  pathway.
caption: Caspase-dependent apoptosis may occur via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway.
  The intrinsic pathway is triggered by internal cellular stress or by proapoptotic
  Bcl-2 proteins, which cause the release of factors such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing
  factor (AIF) from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Such factors activate caspase
  9, which activates the apoptosome, which further activates caspase 3 or 7. Of note,
  nitric oxide (NO) is found to upregulate Bcl-2 proteins. IFN-Î³-activated macrophages
  further upregulate nitric oxide synthase, thereby increasing NO and thus proapoptotic
  Bcl-2 proteins. In contrast, the extrinsic pathway is activated via death receptors,
  such as Fas or TNF receptor. This activates caspase 8, which further activates caspase
  3 or 7. Of note, Mtb may secrete TNF-R2, which can inhibit the TNF receptor
