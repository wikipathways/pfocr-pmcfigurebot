caption: (A-D) Source data and replicate numbers for differential expression analysis.
  (E) Heatmap showing the normalized enrichment score (NES) for specific KEGG and
  Hallmark pathways and custom gene sets for endothelial cell pathways by GSEA analysis,
  only pathways achieving an FDR<0.01 in two or more comparisons are shown. (F) Example
  GSEA enrichment plots, showing pathway enrichment in disease versus healthy capillary
  clusters in cortex (Cluster 1 vs Cluster 3). (G) Clustering of GSEA pathways enriched
  by overlap in genes between pathways. (E) GSEA derived *FDR<0.05, ** FDR<0.01, ***FDR<0.001
