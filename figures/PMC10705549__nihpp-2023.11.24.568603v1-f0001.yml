figure_title: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to aberrant global alternative splicing
caption: '(A) Principal component analysis of exon inclusion level from 190 samples.
  (B) Number of differential alternative splicing events (DASEs) of five alternative
  splicing types. The DASEs were defined as following criteria: absolute PSI differences
  value > 0.1 and corrected p-value < 0.05. (C) Results of the top 5 terms of GO biological
  process and KEGG pathways enriched with the 1,928 genes from 3,381 DASEs (HC vs.
  All patients). (D) Venn diagrams displaying the gene overlap between DASEs in the
  SE and MXE categories, respectively, and the set of SARS-CoV-2 susceptible genes.
  (E) Heatmap of differentially alternative spliced SARS-CoV-2 susceptible genes between
  HC and COVID-19 patients. Z-score indicate relative exon inclusion levels. Hierarchical
  clustering of DASEs was performed with Euclidean distance matrix of relative exon
  inclusion levels. (F) Significant differential spliced events of TLR4 (chr9:117,704,403–117,724,735)
  and JAK3 (chr19:17,824,782–17,847,982) showing two skipped exon (SE) events and
  six mutually exclusive exon (MXE) events, respectively. Exon inclusion levels represent
  the usage of spliced exons in the case of SE events, while in the context of MXE
  events, they indicate the ratio of the second mutually exclusive exon within each
  event. The expression level refers to the overall gene expression level. The error
  bar indicates standard deviation of the mean. (G) Correlation analysis of expression
  differences between the inclusion level differences of total genes revealed no significant
  correlation'
