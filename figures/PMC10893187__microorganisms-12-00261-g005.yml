figure_title: (A) Enriched GO terms found in high muscle yield recolonized larvae.
caption: (A) Enriched GO terms found in high muscle yield recolonized larvae. Notable
  pathways include gas transport, NADH dehydrogenase activity, respirasome, and electron
  transport activity. (B) Enriched GO terms found in low muscle yield recolonized
  larvae. Significant pathways include negative regulation of the insulin receptor
  signaling pathway and retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway
