figure_title: Fucoxanthin isolated from TLE regulates the expression of OA-related
  signaling molecules through the inactivation of the NF-κB, JNK, and ERK pathways.
caption: 'Fucoxanthin isolated from TLE regulates the expression of OA-related signaling
  molecules through the inactivation of the NF-κB, JNK, and ERK pathways. For the
  in silico analysis, chondrocytes were administered 50 μM of fucoxanthin sourced
  from TLE along with IL-1β at 1 ng/mL for 12 h, followed by RNA sequencing. (A) RNA-seq
  was performed using RNA samples isolated from three groups (control, IL-1β, IL-1β
  + fucoxanthin, 50 μM). GSEA was conducted to analyze the expression of genes associated
  with each signaling pathway. (B) The graph presents the number of genes with an
  altered expression in samples treated with IL-1β versus that in the control and
  that in the group with fucoxanthin and IL-1β. (C,D) Protein levels of ERK, pERK,
  JNK, pJNK, p65, pp65, p38, and pp38 were detected by Western blotting and their
  relative intensities were measured using densitometry (n = 5). pp65 MW: 65 kDa.
  p65 MW: 65 kDa. pJNK MW: 46 and 54 kDa. JNK MW: 46 and 54 kDa. pp38 MW: 43 kDa.
  p38 MW: 40 kDa. pERK MW: 42 and 44 kDa. ERK MW: 42 and 44 kDa. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD as determined by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test
  (n = 5). Significant differences compared to the IL-1β treated group are denoted
  as * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, and n.s. = not significant.
