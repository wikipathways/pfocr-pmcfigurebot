figure_title: Overview of the workflow and methodology used in this work
caption: (A) Experiment design and labeling workflow depicting cell culture, growth,
  isotope labeling, quantification, and initial metabolomics analysis. (B) Schematic
  illustration of the step-by-step procedure employed to obtain transient metabolic
  fluxes and analyze the inherent dynamic modulations of the Arabidopsis sphingolipid
  biosynthesis pathway. (C) In silico knockout (KO)/essentiality hypothesis testing
  using the customized MATLAB implementation of r-DMFA modeling framework. Within
  the metabolic network, hypothetical enzyme perturbations were introduced and assessed
  using the r-DMFA modeling framework in MATLAB, highlighting transient flux alterations.
  By comparing the model-generated fluxes with those observed in a wild-type reference
  model, this method efficiently guides and streamlines subsequent experimental validations,
  reducing the need for repeated iterations
