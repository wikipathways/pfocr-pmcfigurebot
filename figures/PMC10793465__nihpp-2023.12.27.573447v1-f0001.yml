figure_title: Multi-omics analysis identifies nucleotide metabolism as a substantially
  rewired metabolic pathway upon classical stimulation
caption: a) Pathway enrichment analysis comparing metabolomic changes in unstimulated
  and stimulated (continually with LPS+IFNγ for 24h) BMDMs.b) Several pathways identified
  in Figure 1a are directly connected to the nucleotide metabolism process.c) Metabolomic
  changes in pentose phosphates, nucleotides, nucleosides, and nitrogenous bases in
  BMDMs over a timecourse of continual or acute (2h) LPS+IFNγ stimulation. Relative
  metabolite abundances are compared to unstimulated cells (0h) and displayed on a
  log2 scale as a heatmap. Each box represents the mean of n=3 independent samples.d)
  Principal component analysis of transcriptomic changes in BMDMs over a timecourse
  of acute LPS+IFNγ stimulation.e) Transcriptional changes in nucleotide metabolism
  in BMDMs over a 96h timecourse of acute (2h) LPS+IFNγ stimulation. Relative expression
  of each gene is compared to unstimulated condition (0h) and displayed on a log2
  scale as a heatmap. Each box represents the mean of n=3 independent samples. Genes
  involved in nucleotide de novo synthesis (blue) or degradation (green) are indicated
  by color codes of gene names
