caption: 'Schematic illustration of APP major cleavage pathways by secretase enzymes
  (adapted from [15]). In the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing, β-site cleaving
  enzyme 1 (BACE1) or β-secretase initially cleaves APP to form the N-terminus of
  Aβ at the Asp+1 residue of the Aβ sequence. Two cleavage products are formed: a
  secreted ectodomain of APP termed sAPP-β and the membrane-bound C-terminal fragment
  β (CTF-β) or C99. The CTF-β fragment is cleaved by γ-secretase to produce the C-terminus
  of the Aβ peptide and an APP intracellular fragment (AICD). A majority of the Aβ
  peptides generated by γ-secretase end at amino acid 40 (Aβ40), and a small proportion
  end at amino acid 42 (Aβ42). Alternatively, in the non-amyloidogenic pathway of
  APP processing, APP cleavage by α-secretase occurs within the Aβ domain at Leu+17
  and produces a secreted sAPP-α ectodomain, and a CTF-α or C83, which is then subsequently
  cleaved by γ-secretase to form the AICD and non-amyloidogenic three kDa fragment,
