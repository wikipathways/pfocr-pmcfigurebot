caption: Sample and nuclei distribution across pathological and study groups are shown
  in the left panel, while the right panel illustrates the bioinformatics pipeline
  employed for the identification of perturbed gene ontology (GO) biological processes
  and their associated gene co-expression networks (), created using BioRender.com.
  The workflow begins with computing pseudo-bulked averages of normalized gene expression
  profiles for single-cell expression profiles of each cell type (Steps 1 & 2). Subsequently,
  pathway activity scores were calculated (Steps 3 & 4), using gene set variation
  analysis (GSVA) as previously described (). Differential pathway activity was then
  estimated for each pathway-cell type combination, employing a multivariate linear
  model (Step 5). Construction of co-expression networks, performed with hdWGCNA ()
  was specifically limited to gene programs comprising perturbed pathways (Steps 6—8).
