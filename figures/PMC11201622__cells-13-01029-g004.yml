caption: Expression of mHTT leads to dendritic hypotrophy parallel to TORC1 pathway.
  (A) Representative image of WT HTT staining in CIV neuron—dendrite marked by dashed
  white lines, axon by solid lines. Scale bar = 3 µm. (B) Representative images of
  mHTT25-Cerulean and mHTT96-Cerulean shown with aggregate inclusion bodies marked
  by white arrows for mHTT96-Cerulean. Scale bar = 10 µm. (C) Representative reconstructions
  of branches from WT and TORC1 genetic manipulations—normalized mCherry::Jupiter
  fluorescence is coded with the rainbow spectrum shown (A.U.) (D) Heat map representing
  the average normalized, binned mCherry::Jupiter fluorescence along dendrites at
  increasing distances from the soma for overexpressions of mHTT 20, 50, and 93 repeats.
  Genotypes found to be significantly different along the dendritic arbor are marked
  with an asterisk. (E) TDL of Cullin1-IR and CCT5-IR in both mHTTQ25 and mHTTQ96
  backgrounds displayed as percent change from WT control. CCT5-IR decreases both
  mHTTQ96 and mHTTQ25 neurons to far lower than WT, while Cullin1-IR rescues mHTT96
  hypotrophy to WT levels. CCT5-IR alone is not significantly different from either
  mHTTQ25;CCT5-IR or mHTTQ96;CCT5-IR. All genotypes vary significantly from WT except
  for mHTTQ96;Cullin1-IR. (F) Representative images of CIV dendritic morphology in
  combined HTT and CCT5-IR or Cullin1-IR combinations. Scale bars = 100 µm. (G) Number
  of mHTT aggregate IBs does not change due to CCT5 or Cullin1 LOF. (H) mHTT aggregates
  in mHTTQ96Cerulean conditions do not change in average area due to CCT5 or Cullin1
  LOF. In all panels * = p < 0.05, ns = not significant; see  for detailed statistics.
