figure_title: Proposed scheme for the gene expression pathways activated as responses
  to xenobiotics in D.
caption: 'Proposed scheme for the gene expression pathways activated as responses
  to xenobiotics in D. suzukii: (a) when xenobiotics reach the cells, GPCRs may activate
  the adenylyl cyclase (AC) pathway, increasing the cAMP level in the cell, which
  ultimately binds to the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) that in turn
  links to the cAMP-response element (CRE) in the nucleus, promoting the expression
  of genes encoding for cytochromes P450 and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs); (b)
  the insulin-like receptor/TOR signaling pathway (the last not represented) interprets
  growth factors, oxygenation state, and nutrition levels, fostering appropriate changes
  in cell growth and proliferation, survival, and fecundity; (c) under adverse conditions
  (e.g., DNA damage), apoptosis may be initiated by the regulation of pro-apoptotic
  proteins, i.e., Reaper, Hid, and Grim, these three forming a complex that inhibits
  the apoptosis inhibitor Diap1 (encoded by gene diap1). This inhibition unlocks the
  initiation caspase Dronc, consequently leading to the activation of effector caspases
  DrICE and Dcp-1; (d) heat shock proteins (HSPs) are expressed to protect cell components
  under stressful conditions'
