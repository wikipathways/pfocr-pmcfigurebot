caption: The tumor microenvironment and extracellular matrix (ECM) induce different
  pathways to regulate drug resistances in various types of cancer [19,32]. These
  pathways are regulated through either YAP or other critical mechanisms [33]. Biophysical-chemical
  changes in ECM’s properties, such as cells’ substrate stiffness, could drive cancer
  cells’ resistance (black arrows) against chemotherapies through YAP and/or YAP-related
  pathways (green; two representative pathways (1) and (2) are indicated), integrin
  (blue; two representative pathways (1) and (2) are indicated), and other signaling
  pathway instead of YAP (orange) [34,35,36,37]. Besides ECM stiffness, other signals
  in the tumor microenvironment, such as shear stress, can induce cancer cells’ drug
  resistance (brown) [38]. Conversely, the application of chemotherapies in cancer
  cells could cause changes in the ECM’s properties (red arrow) [39]. Understanding
  the functional networks between ECM, ECM’s mechanical stimulations, and cancer drug
  resistance opens the door to designing and developing next-generation effective
  clinical treatments [15,40,41]. Created with Biorender.com
