figure_title: PS protective effect against DSS-induced colitis involves inflammation
  and immune function-associated signaling pathways.
caption: PS protective effect against DSS-induced colitis involves inflammation and
  immune function-associated signaling pathways. (a) Score scatter plot from PCA model
  of non-ABX-treated colons of mice described in Figure 5a. n = 4–8 mice per group.
  The black dashed lines represented the lines between samples within the same group
  (with 95% confidence intervals). (b) Quantitative statistics of the number of differential
  expression genes between any two groups (|log2fold change|≥ 1 & adjust p < 0.05).
  (c) Hierarchical clustering heatmap of differential expression genes in each group
  described in (a). (d) Bubble plot of selected KEGG enrichment analysis for differential
  expression genes described in (c)
