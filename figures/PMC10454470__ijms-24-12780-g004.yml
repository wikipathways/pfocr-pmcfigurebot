figure_title: Galectin signaling pathways may be involved in the mitochondrial dysfunction
  of CD8+ T cells in severe/critical COVID-19 patients.
caption: 'Galectin signaling pathways may be involved in the mitochondrial dysfunction
  of CD8+ T cells in severe/critical COVID-19 patients. (A) The UMAP presentation
  of 14 heterogeneous clusters of epithelial cells. (B) Percentage of epithelial cells
  across healthy controls (HC, blue), moderate (O, green), and severe/critical (S/C,
  red) COVID-19 patients in individual clusters. (C) Hierarchical plot (left) and
  chord diagram (right) show the inferred intercellular communication network (only
  the effect of epithelial cells on CD8+ T cells is represented here) for galectin
  signaling. E1, 3–7, 10–12: nine epithelial cell groups separated from severe/critical
  COVID-19 patients; C3, 10: two CD8+ T cell groups from severe/critical COVID-19
  patients. Different colors represent different cell clusters. (D) CellChat infers
  the strength of different cell groups as senders or receivers of signals during
  cellular communication. The color bar shows the strength of signals, the histograms
  with different colors indicate the total strength of different cell groups, and
  the x- and y-axes represent the signal receiver (CD8+ T cells) or sender (epithelial
  cells). (E) Violin plots comparing the normalized expression level of LGALS1, LAGLS3,
  and LGALS9 transcripts in various epithelial clusters of COVID-19 patients with
  severe/critical disease. (F) Bubble plot showing the stronger effects of multiple
  galectin ligand–receptor pairs on C10 involved in cellular communication. The color
  bar shows the strength of signals. (G) Violin plots exhibit the expression levels
  of relative receptor genes in C3 and C10'
