  mast cells.
caption: |-
  Effects of the TAAR extract on Nrf2 activation signaling pathway in mast cells. (A) The protein expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 in anti-DNP IgE/BSA-treated RBL-2H3 cells. (B) Bar graphs displaying the relative intensity ratios of Western blot bands for Nrf2/β-actin, HO-1/β-actin, and NQO1/β-actin. Each value is presented as the mean ± SEM and analyzed by Tukey’s post hoc test from three independent experiments. ###
  p < 0.001 vs. no treatment control group; ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 vs. anti-DNP IgE/BSA treatment only group
