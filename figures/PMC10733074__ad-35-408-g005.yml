figure_title: 'Effects of EMQ on the NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 macrophages
  induced by LPS. The cells were treated with EMQ (25, 50, 100, or 200 µg/ml) for
  12 hours prior to the addition of LPS (1 µg/ml), and the cells were incubated for
  24 hours. The p65, IκBα, and p-IκBα protein levels were determined by western blot
  analysis (A). Relative protein expression was determined by densitometry (B). The
  cells were pretreated with EMQ for 12 hours prior to the addition of LPS, and they
  were incubated for 1.5 hours. The nuclear translocation of p65 was visualized by
  immunofluorescence. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). The stained
  cells were visualized with a fluorescence microscope at 400× magnification (C).
  Data represent the means of three independent experiments±standard deviation. EMQ:
