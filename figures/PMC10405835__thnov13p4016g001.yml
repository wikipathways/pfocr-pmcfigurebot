caption: Generation and characterization of OX40L-armed oncolytic HSV-1. A) The schematic
  representation of HSV-1 based oncolytic virus encoding murine OX40L or GFP. The
  trimerized mOX40L was constructed by IL2 signal sequence-Traf2 coiled-coil domain-mOX40L
  extracellular domain-PDGFR transmembrane domain. B) GFP or membrane-displayed OX40L
  expression level on KPC cells after infection with OV-GFP or OV-mOX40L. KPC cells
  were infected with OV-GFP or OV-mOX40L at an MOI of 1. Cells were stained with OX40L
  antibody after 24 hours and detected by flow cytometry. C) Virus replication in
  the KPC cells. KPC cells were infected with OV-GFP or OV-mOX40L at an MOI of 0.1,
  and viral titers were determined using plaque assays at different times post infection.
  D) Cytopathic effect (CPE) of OV-mOX40L against KPC cells. KPC cells were infected
  with OV-GFP or OV-mOX40L at an MOI of 1. Cells were observed under the microscope
  after 24 hours. E-F) ICD of tumor cells was induced by OV-mOX40L. KPC cells were
  infected with OV-GFP or OV-mOX40L for 48 hours. The released ATP was detected by
  the ATP detection kit (E) and the cell surface exposure of calreticulin was analyzed
  by flow cytometry (F). The data for ATP concentration were representative of three
  independent experiments. G) Effect of OV-mOX40L on Jurkat-NF-κB-GFP-OX40 reporter
  cells. HEK293FT cells were infected with OV-GFP or OV-mOX40L and cocultured with
  Jurkat-NF-κB-GFP-OX40 reporter cells, which express GFP upon activation of the OX40-OX40L
  signaling pathway. The GFP expression of the reporter cells was analyzed by flow
  cytometry. H) Effect of OV-mOX40L on T cell proliferation. CFSE-labeled T cells
  were cocultured with OV-infected KPC cells in 96-well plate precoated with anti-CD3
  antibody for three days. The proliferation of T cells, which exhibited decreased
  CFSE fluorescence intensity, was detected by flow cytometry. I) Effect of OV-mOX40L
  on T cell activation. T cells were cocultured with OV-infected KPC cells in 48-well
  plate precoated with anti-CD3 antibody for 24 hours. The activation markers IFN-γ
  and granzyme B of T cells were detected by flow cytometry
