caption: Transcriptional expression analysis of the AsA metabolic pathway in strawberries.
  The main pathways for ascorbic acid synthesis in plants are the L-galactose pathway,
  the myoinositol pathway, the L-gulose pathway, and the D-galacturonate pathway.
  Alase, aldono-lactonase; AO, ascorbate oxidase; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; DHA,
  dehydroascorbic acid; DHAR, dehydroascorbate reductase; GalUR, D-galacturonate reductase;
  GDH, L-galactose dehydrogenase; GGP, GDP-L-galactose-phosphorylase; GalLDH, L-galactono-1,4-lactone
  dehydrogenase; GMP, GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase; GPP, L-galactose-1-phosphate
  phosphatase; GulLO, L-gulono-1,4-lactone oxidase; HK, hexokinase; IMP, myoinositol
  monophosphatase; MDHA, monodehydroascorbic acid; MDHAR, monodehydroascorbate reductase;
  MIOX, myoinositol oxygenase; PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase; PMI, phosphomannose
  isomerase; PMM, phosphomannomutase. For the gene expression comparison, the log2
  transformed CPM values were presented as a heatmap with the WT on the left and the
  OE of MT on the right
