caption: A, B and C represent fruit growth and development from the young to expanding
  stages, from the expanding to yellow fruit stages, and from the yellow fruit to
  red fruit stages, respectively. (a–c) A differential metabolic volcano map. The
  horizontal coordinates represent the change in the levels of metabolites in the
  different groups (log2FoldChange), and the vertical coordinates represent the significance
  level of the differences (−log10p-value). Each point in the volcanic map represents
  a metabolite. The red dots represent the significantly upregulated metabolites,
  and the green dots represent the significantly downregulated metabolites. The dot
  size represents the VIP value. (d,e) A KEGG-enriched bubble diagram. The horizontal
  coordinate is x/y (the number of differential metabolites in the corresponding metabolic
  pathway/the total number of identified metabolites in the pathway). A higher value
  indicates a higher concentration of differential metabolites in the pathway. The
  colour of the dots represents the p-value of the hypergeometric test, and a smaller
  value represents a more reliable and statistically significant test. The dot size
  represents the number of differential metabolites in the corresponding pathway,
  and a larger point represents more differential metabolites in the pathway
