figure_title: The activated PCP signaling pathway.
caption: The activated PCP signaling pathway. (A) The signaling transduction of the
  PCP pathway is identified and represented after the analysis via IPA. Molecules
  of differential upregulation in the high DDX3X group were labeled in red. (B) Relative
  log2-transformed expressions of the principal molecules in PCP pathway are shown.
  The analysis was performed via IngenuityÂ® Pathway Analysis (IPA; QIAGEN, Hilden,
  Germany; https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/products-overview/discovery-insights-portfolio/analysisand-visualization/qiagen-ipa/
