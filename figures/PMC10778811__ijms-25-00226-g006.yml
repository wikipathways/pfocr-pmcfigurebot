figure_title: MAVS degradation is inhibited by Mito-TEMPO and TRIF siRNA.
caption: 'MAVS degradation is inhibited by Mito-TEMPO and TRIF siRNA. (A) BEAS-2B
  cells were stimulated with 10 μg/mL of poly(I:C) and the expression of MAVS signaling
  pathway analyzed using Western blot. (B) Relative MAVS, phosphorylated TBK-1 (p-TBK-1)/TBK-1
  and p-IRF-3/IRF-3 protein expressions were assessed according to the indicated time
  point and normalized to the GAPDH reference protein. Data are the mean ± standard
  deviation (SD) of three independent experiments, and the results normalized to untreated
  control cells. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test, ** p <
  0.01 vs. untreated control cells. (C) BEAS-2B cells were pre-treated with 100 μM
  Mito-TEMPO for 1 h and stimulated with 10 μg/mL of poly(I:C) for 6 h. Expressed
  MAVS protein levels were detected via Western blot. (D) Relative MAVS protein expressions
  were assessed according to the indicated time point and normalized to the GAPDH
  reference protein. Data are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, and
  the results normalized to untreated control cells. Statistical analysis was performed
  using Student’s t-test, ** p < 0.01 vs. untreated control cells; # p < 0.01 vs.
  poly(I:C)-treated cells. (E) The expression of MAVS and its downstream molecules
  were evaluated in TRIF siRNA transfected BEAS-2B cells using Western blot analysis.
  The poly(I:C)-stimulated cells (6 h) with or without TRIF gene silencing. (F) Relative
  TRIF, MAVS, p-TBK-1/TBK-1 and p-IRF-3/IRF-3 protein expressions were assessed and
  normalized to GAPDH. Data are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, and
  the results normalized to untreated control cells. Statistical analysis was performed
  using Student’s t-test, ** p < 0.01 vs. untreated control cells; # p < 0.01 vs.
