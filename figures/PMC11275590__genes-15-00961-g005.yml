caption: Lung cancer imbalanced heme biosynthesis is supported by both bulk and single-cell
  RNAseq and is linked to the overall survival (OS) of patients. (A,B) Patient tumor
  tissue RNAseq and single-cell lung cancer RNAseq support porphyrin overdrive. Genome
  analysis (shown in (A)) was based on lung cancer data publicly available at The
  Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program. The single-cell
  expression data from Zilionis et al. [65] were used to study the expression differences
  in more aggressive vs. more differentiated lung cancer cell populations within the
  same tumor. * denotes statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). (C) The
  skewness of the heme biosynthesis pathway, representing the degree of porphyrin
  overdrive, is quantified by the ratio of ALAD to HMBS expression levels. (D) The
  disparity in expression levels between the heme/porphyrin export gene FLVCR1 and
  the importer FLVCR2 is determined by the ratio of these two genes. (E,F) Imbalanced
  heme biosynthesis in lung cancer is related to patient OS. The Kaplan–Meier estimator,
  a non-parametric statistic, was used to estimate the survival function from the
  lifetime data. Shown are the Kaplan–Meier curves for data of visualization of ALAD
  (panel (C)) and HMBS expression (panel (D)) in lung adeno carcinoma cancer patients.
  The expression data were from TCGA and were analyzed in relation to the OS of the
  respective patients. Expression of ALAD and HMBS (the genes for the second and third
  enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway, respectively) show contrasting prognostic
  results in patients’ OS, suggesting that the greater the extent of porphyrin production
  (i.e., the larger the difference between ALAD and HMBS expression), the more aggressive
  the lung cancer. The statistical difference between the groups is estimated by the
  log-rank test. [FC, fold-change]. Tumor or more aggressive tumor results are colored
