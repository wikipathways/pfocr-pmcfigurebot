figure_title: Collagen pathway gene expression is elevated in Lair1 KO S. aureus-infected
  skin and macrophages
caption: '(A, C) Bone marrow-derived macrophages from WT and Lair1 KO mice were treated
  with PBS or PAM3CSK4 for 6 hours, then subjected to RNA-sequencing. (B, D) Skin
  punch biopsies from WT and Lair1 KO mouse S. aureus skin infection were taken at
  2 dpi, then subjected to RNA-sequencing. GSEA was used to define the top 20 mouse
  Reactome pathways in genes upregulated in Lair1 KO in BMDM treated with PAM3CSK4
  (A) and skin infection (B); collagen-related pathways common to both analyses are
  bolded in teal. Genes from the four pathways, many of which overlapped, were classified
  into three general categories: collagen genes, collagen synthesis genes, and extracellular
  matrix (ECM) remodeling genes. Heat maps show z-scored expression for these genes
  for BMDM (C) and S. aureus skin infection (D). Example images from trichrome stained
  S. aureus-infected skin lesions at 1 dpi from WT (E) and Lair1 KO (F) are shown,
  with abscess marked with an asterisk (dermonecrosis not yet developed at 1 dpi),
  as well as average capsule thickness at 3 points per lesion, measured in 4 WT and
  5 KO skin lesions across multiple sections (G) (unpaired t-test, ns = non-significant).'
