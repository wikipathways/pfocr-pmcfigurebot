figure_title: Assessment of inhibition of different TGF β signaling pathways on hCECs
  cultivated in the presence of FBS.
caption: 'Assessment of inhibition of different TGF β signaling pathways on hCECs
  cultivated in the presence of FBS. After cell seeding in 384-well plates, the hCECs
  were cultured in culture medium based on BGM that contained 8% FBS for 4 weeks.
  BGM only (control) or BGM containing one of the inhibitors of the TGF-β signaling
  pathways was assessed. (A) Illustrative images. Cell lateral membranes were stained
  in green by NCAM and the nuclei were counter-stained in blue using DAPI. The images
  were taken in the center of each well. Objective X40, scale bar = 50 µm. (B) Assessment
  of standardized ECD. ECD was assessed by nuclei counting using DAPI staining. The
  ECD data were standardized by calculating the ratio with controls. At least four
  cell cultures from different donors were used (n ≥ 32 wells). (C) Assessment of
  EndMT by normalized fluorescence intensity of NAM. The IF images of NCAM were acquired
  with an FITC filter using the same parameters. Normalized fluorescence intensity
  represents the fluorescence intensity per cell/cell perimeter. The data were also
  standardized by calculating the ratio with the control. At least four cell cultures
  from different donors were used (n ≥ 8 wells). Significant differences by comparison
  to controls were denoted by red stars on the corresponding bars: *** p < 0.0001,
  ** p < 0.001, * p < 0.005'
