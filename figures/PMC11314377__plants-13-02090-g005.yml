caption: Heatmap analysis of gene expression involved in ABA synthesis and sucrose
  metabolism pathways in the leaf sheaths of B03S. (A) Heatmap analysis of gene expression
  in the ABA synthesis pathway. (B) Heatmap analysis of gene expression in the sucrose
  metabolism pathway. The data were normalized and transformed to the leaf sheath
  of B03S (n = 3)
