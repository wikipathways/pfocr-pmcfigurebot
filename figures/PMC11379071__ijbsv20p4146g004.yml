caption: LATS2 stimulates PSAT1 transcription via the YAP/ATF4 pathway. (A and B)
  The promoter of PSAT1 was mutated as indicated (A), and luciferase activity was
  measured using a dual-luciferase system after the indicated vectors were transfected
  into HepG2 and HUH6 cells (B). (C) The PSAT1 promoter activity of wild-type (WT)
  and mutant (Del-1) strains was measured using a dual-luciferase system in HepG2
  and HUH6 cells with simultaneous overexpression of LATS2, with or without YAP1.
  (D and E) Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using an anti-YAP1 antibody or negative
  control anti-IgG antibody (D), and qRT-PCR (E) was then conducted on HepG2 and HUH6
  cells. (F) Predicted binding site (PBS) of YAP1 and the promoter of PSAT1 according
  to bioinformatics analysis of GSE99315. (G) Reciprocal co-IP of YAP1 and ATF4 was
  performed using anti-YAP1 and anti-ATF4 antibodies, respectively, followed by WB
  using the indicated antibodies in HepG2 and HUH6 cells. (H) Colocalization of YAP1
  and ATF4 in HepG2 and HUH6 cells, as measured by confocal microscopy. Scale bar,
  50 μm. (I and J) Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using an anti-ATF4 antibody or
  negative control anti-IgG antibody (I), and qPCR (J) was then conducted in HepG2
  and HUH6 cells. (K) The PSAT1 promoter activity of the WT and Del-1 strains was
  measured using a dual-luciferase system in HepG2 and HUH6 cells with simultaneous
  overexpression of PSAT1. (L and M) The protein (L) and mRNA (M) expression levels
  of PSAT1 were measured under the indicated treatments. (N-P) Ferroptotic events
  in YAP1-overexpressing cells with or without ATF4 knockdown were evaluated by measuring
  cell viability (N), lipid ROS levels (O), and MDA production (P). (Q) The relative
  level of cysteine was detected under the indicated conditions. All quantitative
  data are shown as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. **p <0.01, ***p
  <0.001, ****p <0.0001
