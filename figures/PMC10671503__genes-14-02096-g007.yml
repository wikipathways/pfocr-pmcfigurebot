caption: 'A proposed model of the heat stress response of largemouth bass (M. salmoides)
  to high temperatures. When faced with high temperatures, largemouth bass adapt to
  heat stress (HS) by modifying the metabolism of lipids, sugars, and amino acids,
  as well as the immune system. Abbreviations are: Steroid: steroid metabolism; UFAs:
  unsaturated fatty acids metabolism; Gly, Ser and Thr: glycine, serine and threonine
  metabolism; β-Ala; β-alanine metabolism; Trp: tryptophan metabolism; p53: p53 signaling
  pathway; ECM: ECM-receptor interaction; inflammatory cytokine: cytokine–cytokine
  receptor interaction and viral protein interaction with cytokine–cytokine receptor.
  The red dashed-line boxes indicate the changed pathways under HS'
