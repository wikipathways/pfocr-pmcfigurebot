caption: The mRNA expression levels of representative DEGs in the cytokine−cytokine
  receptor pathway were measured in the livers of overfed and control geese. The overfed
  geese were overfed for 24 days while the control geese had free access to feed and
  water. The gene expression was measured using qPCR. *, ** denote p < 0.05 and p
  < 0.01 versus the control, respectively; n = 8. The internal reference gene was
  β-actin and all data are presented as the mean ± SEM
