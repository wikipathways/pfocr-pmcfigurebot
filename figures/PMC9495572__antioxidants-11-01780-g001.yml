caption: Cartoon showing the dysregulation of oxidative stress-mediated pathways in
  PD and the utility of the Nrf2/Bach1 signaling pathway as a therapeutic target.
  Mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasomal impairment, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation
  are the key players underlying Parkinson’s pathophysiology. Both environmental factors
  and genetic mutations of DJ-1, Parkin, PINK1, α-synuclein, and LRRK2 increase oxidative
  stress, which results in neuronal cell death. Oxidative stress activates the Nrf2
  pathway by covalently modifying the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and releasing Nrf2 to
  translocate into the nucleus freely. Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 forms heterodimers
  with the small MAF protein, and this competitively displaces Bach1 from the ARE
  binding site. This results in the transcriptional activation of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
  and neuroprotective genes that work in unison against PD-associated neurodegenerative
  pathways. Electrophilic Nrf2 activators can also disrupt the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction
  and result in the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Unfortunately, these Nrf2 activators
  also deplete the GSH levels and contribute to oxidative stress in the neurons, which
  are already in a compromised state. Bach1, a physiological repressor of Nrf2, occupies
  the same binding site as Nrf2. Bach1-inhibition by genetic and pharmacological means
  results in the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, subsequently imparting neuroprotection
  in PD pathogenesis. The Bach1 inhibitor (HPPE) is a well-established non-electrophile
  and does not deplete GSH and thus does not contribute to oxidative stress.
