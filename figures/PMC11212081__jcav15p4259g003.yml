caption: 'Combination treatment with gefitinib and TRQ significantly increased ROS
  levels and cell redox ratio in NSCLC models. (A, B) Representative confocal image
  of mitochondrial superoxide (green, scale bars, 500 μm) and intracellular ROS (red,
  scale bars, 500 μm) in 2D cell lines after treated with gefitinib (2.5 μM), TRQ
  (0.6%) alone or together. (C, D) Representative confocal image of mitochondrial
  superoxide (green, scale bars, 50 μm) and intracellular ROS (yellow, scale bars,
  50 μm) in 3D cell spheres after treated with gefitinib (20 μM), TRQ (0.8%) alone
  or together. (E, F) Representative morphology image and composite image in cell
  spheres after treated with gefitinib (20 μM), TRQ (0.8%) alone or together (scale
  bars, 50 μm). The higher the value was, the lower the cell redox ratio (FAD/[NADH+FAD])
  was. The results are represented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05 versus the control group,
  #P < 0.05 versus the gefitinib alone group, **P or ##P < 0.01, ***P or ###P < 0.001.
  Ctrl, the control group; TRQ, Tanreqing injection; Gefi, gefitinib; PC-9-PIK3CA-M,
  PC-9-PIK3CA-mutation.'
