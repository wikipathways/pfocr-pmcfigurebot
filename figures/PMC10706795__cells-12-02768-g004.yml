figure_title: PE signaling pathway in neurons and pancreatic beta cells.
caption: 'PE signaling pathway in neurons and pancreatic beta cells. PE is present
  in the general circulation, being secreted by several cells, such as adipocytes,
  skeletal muscle and the intestinal epithelium. PE is a specific K2P TREK-1 channel
  blocker, thus inducing partial plasma membrane depolarization. The subsequently
  induced calcium entry activates several signaling pathways: Akt, ERK and CaM-Kinases.
  The final resulting activation upregulates CREB transcriptional activity, maintaining
  cellular functions. As described, secreted peptides can modulate central and peripheral
  targets and provide co-benefits for different but related pathologies. In both cases,
  the target is a common molecular system that generates similar protective and functional
  improvements for the challenged organs'
