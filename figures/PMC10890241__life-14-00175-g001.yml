caption: 'Three hypotheses of metabolic evolution, and where appropriate, a reference
  to iron sulfur cluster development is given. Top left: the retrograde hypothesis
  of metabolic evolution (A–D = molecules of a biosynthetic pathway, with A being
  the end product; E1–E3 = enzymes). Top right: Granick’s forward hypothesis of metabolic
  evolution (A–D = small molecules that are of a biosynthetic pathway, with A being
  the end product; E1–E3 = enzymes). Bottom: the patchwork hypothesis of metabolic
  evolution (A–C = precursor molecules; D–F = products of an enzymatic transformation;
  E1 represents the ancestral catalyst which endowed substrate promiscuity that was
  able to catalyze three different, but similar reactions; E2 represents the next
  generation of enzymes, in which the amino acid sequence has diverged slightly and
  substrate specificity and catalytic activity have been increased)'
