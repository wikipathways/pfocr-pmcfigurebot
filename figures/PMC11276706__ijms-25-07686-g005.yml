figure_title: Target analysis of miR-146a-5p and miR-146a-3p.
caption: Target analysis of miR-146a-5p and miR-146a-3p. In silico target analysis
  was performed using www.mirnet.ca showing 203 targets of miR-146a-5p and 116 targets
  of miR-146a-3p including three overlapping targets. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrates
  15 targets implicated in Toll-like receptor signaling (yellow), eight genes involved
  in RIG-I-like receptor signaling (green), and 12 targets belonging to chemokine
  signaling pathway (orange) (a). Targets that are allocated to multiple pathways
  are shown as increased dots. Pathways found in the KEGG pathway analysis and their
  respective padj values are displayed in (b) with relevant pathways colored in red.
  Effects of target modulation by miR-146a-5p mimic and anti-miR-146a-5p transfection
  were measured individually and in combination in stimulated A549 cells. qPCR measurements
  show expression of IRAK1 (c), TRAF6 (d), DDX3X (e), RNF125 (f), and CXCR4 (g) in
  transfected cells. n = 3. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001
