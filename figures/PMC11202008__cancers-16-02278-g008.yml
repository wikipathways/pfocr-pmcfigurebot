caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis for K562 TK.007 (A) and WT (B) after treatment
  with the IC50 concentration of GCV. mRNAs responsible for IL production, CREB signaling,
  STAT3 pathway activation, and phagosome pathway activation were upregulated, while
  mRNAs for the oxytocin signaling pathway and FGF signaling were inhibited upon treatment
