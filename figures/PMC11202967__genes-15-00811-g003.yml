figure_title: KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs.
caption: KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs. (A) KEGG annotation
  graph of differentially expressed miRNA target genes. The ordinate is the name of
  the KEGG metabolic pathway, and the ordinate is the number of genes annotated with
  this pathway and their proportion of the total number of genes annotated; (B) rich
  hub diagram of KEGG pathway of differentially expressed miRNA target genes. Each
  symbol in the figure represents a KEGG pathway, and the pathway name is shown in
  the legend on the right. The abscissa is the enrichment factor, which represents
  the proportion of the number of differentially expressed miRNA target genes annotated
  to a certain pathway to the total number of genes annotated to this pathway
