caption: Signaling Pathway Activation by MNX and Adenosine treatment in cultured DPCs.
  The changes in mRNA expression profiles by MNX and adenosine in cultured human dermal
  papilla cells. Cells were treated with MNX and adenosine for one day, and mRNA expression
  was examined using RT-PCR. (a) Among 78 genes, the 7 genes with more than a 1.5-fold
  increase and statistical significance (p < 0.05) were displayed, red and blue colors
  mean increase and decrease in the mRNA expression, respectively. We further investigated
  using protein cluster analysis; (b) activated genes by both MNX and adenosine; and
  (c) activated genes by adenosine, not MNX. Significantly different compared with
  non-treated control (NT) (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). The experimental
  data were investigated in five independent experiments
