figure_title: Pathway analysis of differential cross-links.
caption: Pathway analysis of differential cross-links. A. Top 5 biological processes
  differential in podocytes and tubules. B. Proteins in betaine metabolic pathway
  that have differential cross-links. C. Heatmap of differential cross-links from
  betaine metabolic pathway. D. Protein level comparison of betaine metabolic process
  proteins that had differential cross-links. E. Top 5 KEGG pathways identified. F.
  Heatmap of all cross-links in AASS from lysine degradation and tryptophan metabolism
  pathways. G. Boxplot showing protein levels of KMO in podocytes and tubules. Significance
  is determined by a two-sided t-test with Benjamin-Hochberg correction at p-value
