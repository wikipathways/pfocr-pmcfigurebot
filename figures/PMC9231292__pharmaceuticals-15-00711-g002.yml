caption: The anti-glycolytic and apoptotic effect of high-dose vitamin-C on tumor
  cell toxicity. High-dose Vit-C can destroy cancer cells by utilizing two different
  pathways that work in tandem. Initially, by producing hydroxyl radical (OH•) through
  the Fenton reaction, extracellular H2O2 may effectively kill cancer cells []. High
  amounts of Fe (III) ions in the cancer microenvironment promote the oxidation of
  Vit-C from the ascorbate radical to DHA and Fe (II). After the generation of Fe(II),
  the ion enters an oxidation process via O2, resulting in the formation of superoxide
  (O2•−), which will be consequently converted to H2O2 and O2 by superoxide dismutase
  (SOD). Transferrin in the extracellular space traps Fe (III) and binds to the TfR
  receptor, and oxidizes the Fe(III) to Fe(II), resulting in the formation of LIP
  inside the tumor cell. The generated extracellular H2O2 can also diffuse directly
  inside tumor cells via aquaporins [], interacting with Fe(II) to form OH•, which
  is hazardous to cancer cells. Then, ascorbate and the ascorbate radical recycle
  Fe(III) to Fe(II), to form DHA, with the generation of intercellular ROS leading
  to cell death by apoptosis. Second, the extracellular oxidation process of ascorbate
  to DHA in large quantities results in DHA uptake by glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1).
  DHA is then reduced by glutathione (GSH) and NADPH to high amounts of intercellular
  ROS, activating poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which in turn consumes cellular
  NAD+, a co-factor of GADPH. As a result of the inhibition of GADPH, ATP production
  via glycolysis stops, leading to energy crisis []. In addition, the intercellular
  ROS generated by DHA oxidation can raise the metabolites and enzymatic activity
  in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), block the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
  and increase oxygen uptake, disrupting intracellular metabolic balance and resulting
  in irreversible cell death, due to an energy crisis. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; farctose-6-phosphate,
