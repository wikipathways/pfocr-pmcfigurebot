caption: The activity of FAK/p38 MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, and Smad pathways in CRC cells
  interfered with either IFN-γ, AT-II, SB203581, or HLY78 alone or in combination.
  (A) Western blot analysis of p-p38, p38, p-FAK, FAK, Wnt, β-catenin, Smad3, and
  Smad1 levels in HT29 and HCT15 cells treated with IFN-γ or AT-II alone or combination.
  (B) Western blot for the FAK/p38 MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, and Smad-related protein expression.
  FAK/p38 MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, and Smad-related proteins were reversely upregulated
  by HLY78 (Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator). Results were shown as mean ± SD. ▲P<0.05,
  ▲▲P<0.01, vs. Control group. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, vs. IFN-γ+AT-II group.

  colorectal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro by blocking the NF-kB p65/PD-L1
  pathway.
