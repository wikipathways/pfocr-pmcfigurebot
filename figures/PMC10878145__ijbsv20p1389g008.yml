  signaling pathway.

  UPP1 knockdown promotes gemcitabine chemosensitivity through the AKT/FOXO1/DCK signaling pathway. (A) MTT assay results revealed that UPP1 knockdown promoted gemcitabine chemosensitivity in SCaBER cells. (B)
  UPP1 knockdown significantly increased the apoptosis rate in SCaBER cells. (C) Immunoblotting analysis revealed that gemcitabine significantly downregulated AKT phosphorylation and upregulated pro-apoptotic protein expression in UPP1 knockdown SCaBER cells. UPP1 overexpression suppressed the gemcitabine-induced inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and downregulated pro-apoptotic protein expression in gemcitabine-treated 5637 cells. The effect of gemcitabine on the volume (D) and viability (E) of shUPP1-transfected and shNC-transfected UM-UC-3 cell-derived xenograft tumors. (F) Analysis of the protein levels in xenograft tumors of different groups. (G) Schematic showing the mechanism by which UPP1 regulates biological status via the AKT signaling pathway. *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001; ns: not significant (p > 0.05)
