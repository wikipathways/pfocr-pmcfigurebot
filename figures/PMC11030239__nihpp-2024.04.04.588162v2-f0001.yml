figure_title: ced-10 embryos undergo an asymmetric P1 division
caption: (A) Diagram illustrating the progression from two cells to four cells in
  the early C. elegans embryo. In this and all images, anterior is to the left and
  posterior to the right, ventral is top and dorsal is bottom. The asymmetric division
  of the P1 cell results in differentially fated EMS and P2 daughters. The EMS/P2
  cell contact is enlarged at right, with key components of the MES-1/SRC-1 (green)
  and Wnt (magenta) signaling pathways labeled. (B) Representative control GFP::tubulin
  and ced-10(t1875); GFP::tubulin embryos imaged by DIC during the second division,
  illustrating normal nuclear centrosome complex orientation on the anterior-posterior
  axis in P1. Arrows point to centrosomes. Graph shows quantification of normal, late
  or failed P1 nuclear rotation (see Methods). (C) Representative epifluorescence
  images of mCh::PAR-2 domains and GFP::tubulin in control and ced-10(t1875) embryos
  at the time of P1 nuclear rotation. Graphs show quantification of P1 nuclear rotation
  in this background and PAR-2 domain orientation
