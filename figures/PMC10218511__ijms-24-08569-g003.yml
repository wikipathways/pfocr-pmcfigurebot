figure_title: Changes in intestinal inflammatory response under heat stress.
caption: Changes in intestinal inflammatory response under heat stress. (A–L) Morphological
  changes in the proximal gut, mid gut, and distal gut under heat stress. IV, length
  of intestinal villi (N = 15); MT, muscular layer thickness (N = 10); ET, the thickness
  of epithelium (N = 25); GC, goblet cell number. (M) The measured gut IV, MT, ET,
  and GC, respectively. (N) The altered intestinal inflammatory signaling pathways,
  by enrichment analysis. (O–S) The levels of cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α,
  IL-10, and TGF-α, in intestinal contents and serum were measured by ELISA. CO-gut,
  intestinal contents of the control group; CO-serum, serum of the control group;
  HS-gut, intestinal contents of the heat stress group; HS-serum, serum of the heat
  stress group. (T–X) The mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-α in the
  intestinal were detected by qRT-PCR. The reference gene is β-actin. Data are expressed
  as means ± SD. ns, no significance; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 using
  a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s HSD test. CO, control
  groups; HS, heat stress groups
