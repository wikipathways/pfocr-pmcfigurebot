caption: Piezo1 located in different cells regulates bone formation. (A) Mechanical
  stimulation by fluid shear stress (FSS), ECM rigidity, hydrostatic pressure (HP),
  and biomaterials (WP-TENG, D-PCL@A, and Yoda1 Bilayer membrane) activates Piezo1
  channels in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), further activates downstream signaling
  pathway. (B) Activation of Piezo1 in osteoblasts (MSC-derived osteoblasts and MC3TC-E1)
  by FSS, LIPUS, Piezoelectric micro-vibration stimulation (PMVS), and increasing
  body weight, and the downstream signaling pathway. (C) FSS, mechanical stretch (MS),
  and Yoda1 activate Piezo1 in osteocytes to enhance bone formation. (D) Piezo1 mediates
  mechanical loading enhances M2 macrophage polarization and promotes proliferation,
  migration, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via secreting TGF-Î²1. (E) Conditional
  knockout Piezo1 in endothelial cells (Piezo1Cdh5Cre) impedes bone formation, while
  Piezo1 activation in intestinal epithelium inhibits bone formation mediated by 5-HT
  production. Created with BioRender.com
