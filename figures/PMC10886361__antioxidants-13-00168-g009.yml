caption: Characteristic bacteria analysis and functional prediction analysis of gut
  microbiota in photoaged mice after EU intervention. (A) LEfSe analysis showed the
  relationship of ASVs (the rings, from outer to inner, represent genus, family, order,
  class, and phylum). (B) Comparison of gut microbiota among the control, UVB, and
  EU+UVB groups with LDA score > 2. (C) A heatmap depicts the differential abundance
  of characteristic microbial taxa. Rows (microbial taxa at the genus level) and columns
  (samples) were ordered by hierarchical clustering. Row-wise Z-score scaling was
  conducted in the heatmap visualization, showing the normalized relative abundance
  by the mean and standard deviation of the specific taxa across all samples. (D)
  Predicted function of the fecal microbiome based on KEGG pathways between the control
  and UVB groups. (E) Predicted function of the fecal microbiome based on KEGG pathways
  between the UVB and EU+UVB groups. Statistical significance difference was performed
  using t-test (p < 0.05) in STAMP. n = 6
