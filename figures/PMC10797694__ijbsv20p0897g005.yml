figure_title: Gremlin1/EGFR activated RhoA via EGFR/MEK/Erk signaling in HURECs.
caption: Gremlin1/EGFR activated RhoA via EGFR/MEK/Erk signaling in HURECs. (A) Gene
  set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq data demonstrating that the EGFR signaling
  was activated in under Gremlin1 stimulation. (B) Representative images of FVM stained
  for EGFR (red). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Two channels were
  merged. Scale bar, 20 μm. (C) Predicted interaction of protein structures of EGFR
  and Gremlin1 and key amino acid residues in the binding pocket between EGFR and
  Gremlin1. (D) Representative western blots and quantification of EGFR/MEK/Erk signaling.
  GAPDH was used as the internal control (n = 3 for each group). Student's t test
  was used to compare differences. (E) GSEA pathway analysis of control / Gremlin1
  treated HURECs for Rho GTPase activation. Heat map displayed the expression of typical
  genes involved in RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. (F) Immunofluorescence staining of
  F-actin (green) and DAPI (blue) in each treatment group. Scale bar, 10 μm. (G) Western
  blotting analysis of activated RhoA, p-ROCK, t-ROCK, p-MLC and t-MLC in HURECs treated
  with Gremlin1 or Gremlin1 + Fasudil for 48h. GAPDH was used as the internal control
  (n = 3 for each group). One-way ANOVA was used to compare the difference. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 compared with control group
