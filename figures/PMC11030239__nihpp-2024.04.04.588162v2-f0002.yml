figure_title: CED-10 acts in the MES-1/SRC-1 signaling pathway for EMS spindle positioning
caption: (A) Representative stills from time-lapse images of GFP::tubulin embryos
  with the indicated genotypes, illustrating the three categories of EMS spindle orientation
  phenotypes observed. Arrowheads indicate EMS centrosomes. (B) Percentage of scored
  embryos for each indicated genotype with normal, late, or failed EMS rotation in
  a GFP::tubulin background. To ensure that the enhanced EMS defects were not indirectly
  caused by abnormal P1 division, only embryos with normal or late P1 spindle rotation
  were included in the analysis for ced-10 and ced-10; mom-2(RNAi) embryos; 24% of
  ced-10; mom-2(RNAi) embryos had a late or failed P1 rotation, similar to that of
  ced-10 alone
article_title: The Rac1 homolog CED-10 is a component of the MES-1/SRC-1 pathway for
