figure_title: KEGG enrichment analysis of the common genes between DEGs and DMGs.
caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of the common genes between DEGs and DMGs. (A) The
  functional classification of common genes within q < 0.05 against parental references,
  where “Metabolic pathway” and “Biosynthesis of amino acids” were enriched in p <
  0.05. (B) The heatmap of ECM-receptor interaction-related genes within the tissues.
  (C) KEGG results of the specifically common genes from paternal and maternal references.
  The key pathways were shown in red font in (C). P, L and M represented pituitarium,
  liver and muscle. Pa and Ma severally represented paternal and maternal genomic
  alignments. The red color text and the yellow dashed box represented paternal genome
  alignment, while the blue color text and the yellow dashed box represented maternal
  genome alignment
