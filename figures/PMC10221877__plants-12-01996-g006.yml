figure_title: Hypothesis map of DA signal in plants.
caption: 'Hypothesis map of DA signal in plants. (a) Effect of Cd stress on DA signaling
  pathway. (b) In the presence of Cd, the effect of DA addition on DA signaling. Green
  represents down-regulation, while red represents up-regulation, and the values beside
  indicate the average change of all DEGs corresponding to a protein. Cluster heatmaps
  were plotted by normalization [log2 (FPKM+1)] and standardization (Z-score), so
  the discrepancy of unigenes expression between both treatments could be demonstrated.
  Red means high expression, while blue means low expression. The solid cone arrows
  indicate activation, while the dashed cone arrows indicate transport. Abbreviations:
  CNGC2, cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel 2; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase;
  ADCY, adenylate cyclase; DR, dopamine receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein
  kinase C; IP3R, IP3 receptor; CAM, calmodulin; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase; MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; CDPK, calcium dependent protein kinase;
  CBL, calcineurin B-like proteins; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; DA, dopamine;
  PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol
  triphosphate; NO, nitric oxide'
