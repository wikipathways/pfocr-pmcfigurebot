figure_title: Silibinin induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and activation
  of the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway in oral cancer cells.
caption: Silibinin induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and activation
  of the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway in oral cancer cells.(A) Cells were incubated
  with DCFH-DA for 30 min following treatment with silibinin for 24 h. ROS levels
  were measured using flow cytometry. (B) Histogram showing quantitative generation
  of ROS. (C) Cells were incubated with DCFH-DA for 30 min following treatment with
  silibinin for 24 h. ROS levels were visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Scale
  bar, 100 Âµm. (D) Protein levels of SOD1, SOD2, p-JNK, JNK, p-c-Jun, and c-Jun determined
  using western blotting
