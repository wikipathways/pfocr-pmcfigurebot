caption: The effect of AHT on critical proteins in the PI3K Akt signaling pathway
  and MAPK signaling pathway. (A) Immunoblot analysis of related proteins. (B) The
  ratio of p-AKT/AKT protein quantification results. (C) The ratio of p-PI3K/PI3K
  protein quantification results. (D) The ratio of p-AMPK/AMPK protein quantification
  results. (E) SIRT1 protein quantification results. (n = 3, ****, ***, **, *, and
  ns represent p < 0.0001, p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p > 0.05, respectively)
