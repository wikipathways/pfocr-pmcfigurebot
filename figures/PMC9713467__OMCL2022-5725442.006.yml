caption: Functional potential prediction of microbiota in cecal contents and soft
  and hard feces. (a) The analysis results of the MetaCyc metabolic pathway including
  various pathways involved in primary and secondary metabolism and related metabolites,
  biochemical reactions, enzymes, and genes. (b) The relative abundance of enzymes
  related to acetic acid synthase in the cecal content group and soft and hard feces
  group. (c) The relative abundance of propionate synthase-related enzymes in the
  cecal content group and soft and hard feces group. (d) The relative abundance of
  butyrate synthase-related enzymes in cecal content group and soft and hard feces
  group. (e) Different metabolic pathway between cecal content group and hard fecal
  group. (f) Different metabolic pathway between cecal content group and soft feces
  group. (g, h) The species composition of upregulated metabolic pathways such as
  P341-PWY and P123-PWY in soft feces group compared with the hard feces group.
