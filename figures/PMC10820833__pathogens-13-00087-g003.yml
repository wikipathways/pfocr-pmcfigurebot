caption: Schematic representation of cellular fates in response to various stress
  stimuli. Evolution of infected cells relative to the levels of Tax and HBZ expression.
  Upon stress signals, induced by replicative senescence, metabolic stress, high expression
  and oncogene-induced senescence, genotoxic agent exposure, and genomic DNA damage
  or chronic inflammation, the cell may undergo transient cell cycle arrest to repair
  and/or prevent accumulation of more cellular damages. If cell cycle checkpoints
  are not functioning properly or the damage is too extensive to be repaired, the
  cell may undergo apoptosis. Cells that undergo early senescence may progress to
  the irreversible late senescence stage in the presence of an active p53 signaling
  pathway or transformation if p53 is inactivated
