caption: A synthetic biology-inspired approach based on a design, build, test and
  learn cycle. In the design phase, bioinformatics analysis of whole genome sequences
  is performed using genome mining computational tools. In the construction phase,
  genetic engineering tools are used to clone, assemble and reconfigure the desired
  biosynthetic pathways with genetic elements and circuits. Finally, novel, enhanced
  and diverse biosynthetic pathway structures with practical applications are screened
