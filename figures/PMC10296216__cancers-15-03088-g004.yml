  through ERK-c-Myc signaling pathway.
caption: Knockdown of UBQLN1 inhibited colorectal cells’ malignant progression through
  ERK-c-Myc signaling pathway. (A,B) Western blot was performed to detect influence
  of UBQLN1 silencing on ERK-MAPK pathway; (C) Western blot was performed to detect
  influence of UBQLN1 silencing on expression of c-MYC; (D) Western blot was performed
  to detect relativity between ERK-MAPK pathway and c-MYC in UBQLN1 silencing cell
  line LoVo; (E) UBQLN1 silencing cell line LoVo was used to establish c-MYC over-expression
  cell line; (F,G) CCK-8 assay was performed to detect cell proliferation in LoVo-shUBQLN1
  followed by c-MYC over-expression; (H–K) Colony formation assay was performed to
  detect cell colony formation ability in LoVo-shUBQLN1 followed by c-MYC over-expression;
  and results were displayed as figures (H,I) and statistical graph (J,K). Data are
  shown as mean ± SD; n = 3 independent experiments; and NS p ≥ 0.05, * p < 0.0.5,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 based on Student’s t-test
