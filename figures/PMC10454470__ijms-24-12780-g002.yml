  severe/critical COVID-19 patients.
caption: 'Cell cycle arrest occurred in certain CD8+ T cell subpopulations of severe/critical
  COVID-19 patients. (A) UMAP embedding of all CD8+ T cells colored by unsupervised
  clustering. (B) Percentage of CD8+ T cells across healthy controls, moderate, and
  severe/critical COVID-19 patients in individual clusters. HC means healthy controls,
  O means moderate COVID-19 patients, and S/C means severe or critical COVID-19 patients.
  (C) A dot plot showing the expression of proliferation-associated genes and FASLG
  by CD8+ T cell clusters. (D) Bar plots show the percentage of clonotypes in specified
  CD8+ T cell clusters from patients with moderate and severe/critical COVID-19. The
  clonotypes are categorized as Large (0.01 < X ≦ 0.1), Medium (0.001 < X ≦ 0.01),
  and Small (0 < X ≦ 0.001) based on their relative abundance. (E) reCAT reconstructs
  cell cycle time-series and predicts cell cycle stages along the time-series. The
  presentation of different cell cycle phases of healthy controls (upper panel), moderate
  patients (middle panel), and severe/critical patients (lower panel). The corresponding
  pie charts show the proportion of CD8+ T cells at different cell cycle stages. (F)
  Pseudo-time trajectory projected onto a UMAP of CD8+ T cells from severe/critical
  COVID-19 patients. Pseudo-time values are color-coded. Numbers in circles indicate
  inferred differentiation paths. The enlarged box is the timing diagram of C3 and
  C10. C3, C10: two CD8+ T cell groups isolated from severe/critical COVID-19 patients.
  (G) Enrichment plots for pathways identified by GSEA. C10 was positively correlated
  with the negative regulation of the cell cycle relative signaling pathway in the
  Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). (H) Heatmap showing average expression of
  cell cycle phases’ gene signatures (rows) in C3 and C10 (columns). The color scale
  shows the expression level of selected transcripts in each cell'
