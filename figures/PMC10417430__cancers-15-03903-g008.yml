caption: 'Synergistic effect of N3a with HSPs and mTOR inhibitors in lymphoma cells:
  Summary of the therapeutic scheme followed in our study, with major findings highlighted
  in bold. Color-coded arrows represent regulation (red: up-, green: down-). The signaling
  pathways in which PI3K, mTOR, MDM2, p53, and Hsp90 are participating, are in a continue
  balance of inter- and intra-activation and deactivation towards cellular homeostasis
  and fitness. Every imbalance in their regulation supports lymphomagenesis, therefore
  are targets of promising therapeutic strategies. In the present study we use synergistically
  four inhibitors of these proteins, namely LY294002, Rapa, N3a, 17-AGG, respectively,
  aiming to suppress lymphoma cell growth'
