caption: DHT decreases Wnt signaling activities in prostate basal cell organoids(A)
  Representative IF images showing TCF/Lef-H2B.GFP reporter signals in basal-derived
  organoids cultured under different conditions. Scale bar, 200 μm.(B) Violin plot
  showing GFP area percentages for different treatment conditions. Over 300 organoids
  cultured at 3 distinct batches were quantified for each condition. ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001,
  Mann-Whitney U test.(C) Scatterplot of the two main components from a principal-component
  analysis of the BM (purple), R (blue), and RD-7 (orange) samples. n = 3 organoid
  samples in each group.(D) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis showing
  distinct transcriptomes of RD-7 from BM and R.(E) GO analysis showing the enriched
  pathways in the comparison of R vs. RD-7, with the number of genes in each pathway.(F
  and G) GSEA comparison of RD-7 vs. R showing androgen-responsive genes enriched
  in the up-regulated genes in the RD-7 group (F), and Wnt pathway genes and organ
  morphogenesis genes enriched in the down-regulated genes of the RD-7 group (G).
