  sepsis.
caption: 'Sequencing analysis of PBMCs from healthy subjects and patients with sepsis.
  (A) PCA plot of PBMC samples from healthy volunteers and patients with sepsis (N=4).
  (B) KEGG analysis of the enriched pathways related to the cell cycle and death from
  transcriptome sequencing of PBMCs in healthy subjects and patients with sepsis (N=4).
  (C) GSEA of cell cycle and death-related pathways in the two groups according to
  KEGG analysis of DEGs from transcriptome sequencing of PBMCs in healthy subjects
  and patients with sepsis (N=4). (D) Western blotting of human PBMC samples to show
  the relative expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, cleaved-GSDMD, and IL-1β between
  the two groups. N=6. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. *P< 0.05, **P< 0.01 versus
