figure_title: 'Metabolic pathway analysis: (A) D1; (B) D7.'
caption: 'Metabolic pathway analysis: (A) D1; (B) D7. The horizontal coordinate indicates
  the pathway impact value, the vertical coordinate indicates the âˆ’log10(p) of the
  pathway, a dot in the figure represents a metabolic pathway, the size of the dot
  is proportional to its impact value, and the color of the dot represents the size
  of the pathway p-value, where the color change from yellow to red represents the
  change in the p-value from large to small. Metabolic pathways: 1. arginine and proline
  metabolism; 2. glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; 3. caffeine metabolism;
  4. taurine/hypotaurine metabolism; 5. tryptophan metabolism; 6. cysteine and methionine
  metabolism; 7. glioxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; 8. arginine metabolism;
  9. alanine metabolism, asparagine, and glutamate metabolism; 10. galactose metabolism;
  11. amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism'
