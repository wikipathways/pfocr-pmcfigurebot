caption: Hypothesized molecular mechanism depicting how Salusin-α ameliorates lipid
  metabolism disorders via regulation of the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway. Salusinα
  was overexpresses or knocked down using lentiviruses. Salusin-α upregulated LKB1
  expression and thus activated AMPK, which resulted in a decrease in the downstream
  SREBP-1c/FASN/ACC levels, thus reducing the severity of NAFLD. AS and NAFLD are
  causative factors in the deterioration of the other respective disease, and the
  elevated levels of LDLs in blood vessels leads to an increase in fatty acid content
  and worsens the degree of NAFLD. Gray arrows indicate the mechanistic process by
  which lentiviral vectors transport and regulate Salusin-α expression. Red arrows
  indicate changes in the expression of signaling pathway molecules following overexpression
  of Salusin-α in HepG2 cells, and green arrows indicate the changes in intravascular
  lipoprotein during the development of AS. LKB1, liver kinase B1; AMPK, adenosine
  5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver
  disease; FASN, fatty acid synthase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AS, atherosclerosis;
  LDL, low density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein; HDL, high-density
  lipoprotein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element binding
  protein-1c; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; p-, phosphorylated
