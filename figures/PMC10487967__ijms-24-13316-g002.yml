caption: 'The cGAS–STING pathway in cell death, autophagy, and senescence. (A) The
  cGAS–STING pathway in MT stress-derived apoptosis. Permeabilization of the mitochondrial
  outer membrane induces the release of mtDNA and cytochrome c into the cytosol. The
  mtDNA then triggers the activation of the cGAS–STING pathway, leading to the production
  of type-I IFN and the association of cytochrome c with APAF1 to form the caspase-9-induced
  apoptosome. This structure further drives apoptosis and promotes caspase-3 and -7
  production, which in turn causes the cleavage of cGAS and IRF-3. (B) The cGAS–STING
  pathway in virus-derived apoptosis. During infection with extracellular pathogens,
  the pathogen-related ER stress results in the direct recruitment of phosphorylated
  TBK1 by STING to trigger apoptosis via a BAX–BAK-dependent pathway. (C) The cGAS–STING
  pathway in pyroptosis. In specific cell types, STING is sorted into lysosomes after
  the activation of the cGAS–STING pathway, which leads to the permeabilization of
  the lysosome membrane and the release of cathepsins into the cytosol. Next, the
  cytosolic cathepsins trigger the activation of caspase-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome
  to drive K+ efflux-dependent pyroptosis. (D) The cGAS–STING pathway in necroptosis.
  The activation of the cGAS–STING pathway by mtDNA leads to the overexpression of
  type-I IFN and TNF-α. This overexpression further stimulates the activation of MLKL
  and RIPK to execute necroptosis. (E) The cGAS–STING pathway in autophagy. To prevent
  the overexpression of type-I IFN, STING traffics to the ERGIC after binding to cGAMP,
  independently of the recruitment of TBK1. This STING-containing ERGIC then acts
  as a source of LC3B, which is essential to autophagosome formation to induce autophagy.
  (F) The cGAS–STING pathway in senescence. When cells undergo ionizing radiation,
  the NL cannot maintain the NE structure, leading to the leakage of chromatin fragments
  (created by senescence-associated DNA damage) from the nucleus to the cytosol to
  initiate the overproduction of type-I IFN and SASP via the cGAS–STING pathway. Consequently,
  the overproduction of type-I IFN activates the p53-p21 signaling pathway to increase
  p16INK4 levels, a hallmark of cellular senescence. Abbreviations: MT stress, mitochondrial
