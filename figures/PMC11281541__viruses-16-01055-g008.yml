figure_title: Evaluation of the effects of MIN on inhibition of the MAPK-ERK signaling
  pathway in TBEV-infected Vero cells.
caption: 'Evaluation of the effects of MIN on inhibition of the MAPK-ERK signaling
  pathway in TBEV-infected Vero cells. (A,B) The RT-qPCR of the mRNA level of FGF2,
  PDGFRA, and PLCB2. (C,D) Western blot of the expression levels of the TBEV envelope
  protein (EP) and p-ERK/ERK. Quantitative analysis of the average gray values of
  TBEV and p-ERK/ERK after normalization against GAPDH. The difference between the
  two groups was analyzed using an independent sample t-test, compared with the TBEV
  group, it was expressed by “*”, * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01), and *** (p < 0.001),
  and compared with the Vero cells group, it was expressed by “#”, # (p < 0.05), ##
  (p < 0.01), and ### (p < 0.001), the ns symbol represented no significant difference'
