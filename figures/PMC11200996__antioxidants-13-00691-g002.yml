caption: Schematic summary of the primary formation pathways of S-nitrosothiols. Nitric
  oxide can be synthesized by nitric oxide synthases and by non-enzymatic mechanisms
  involved in the enterosalivary cycle of nitrate [72]. It can also be produced as
  a result of enzymatic nitrite reductase activity of deoxyhemoglobin, endothelial
  alpha globin, xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), aldehyde oxidase (AO), sulfite oxidase
  (SO), and moonlighting enzyme mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component (mARC)
  [61,62,63,64,65,66,67]. Once formed, NO can react with various protein substrates
  containing residues of the amino acid cysteine, which can be nitrosated producing
  S-nitrosoproteins (nitrosothiols). Subsequently, S-transnitrosation reaction can
  transfer the nitro group from one thiol group to another, thus nitrosating other
  proteins. Such nitrosation reactions can be catalyzed by metalloproteins such as
  cytochrome C, ceruloplasmin, and ironâ€“sulfur centers [73]. This molecular modification
  produced by nitrosation alters the function of proteins, modulating their activity.
