caption: Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed exosome-based proteins
  associated with LM in NSCLC and SCLC (LM_NSCLC_DEEPs and LM_SCLC_DEEPs). A Comparison
  between LM_NSCLC_DEEPs and LM_SCLC_DEEPs. B Heatmap indicated a few distinctive
  proteins expressed differently in LM patients in SCLC and NSCLC. C, D GO annotation
  analysis of the specific LM_NSCLC_DEEPs and LM_SCLC_DEEPs, respectively. E, F KEGG
  pathway analysis of the specific LM_NSCLC_DEEPs and LM_SCLC_DEEPs, respectively.
  G, H Protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network of the specific LM_NSCLC_DEEPs and
  LM_SCLC_DEEPs, respectively. Red and blue plots indicated upregulated and downregulated
  proteins, respectively
