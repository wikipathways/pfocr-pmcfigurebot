caption: Effect of FgPex4 and FgPex22-like deletion on peroxisome synthesis pathway
  of Fusarium graminearum. (A) Relative quantitative analysis of peroxisome synthesis-related
  genes at the transcriptional level. The mycelia were collected and cultured in liquid
  CM medium for 24 h, and RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed for repeated qRT-PCR
  experiments. GAPDH was used as an internal reference gene. (B) Relative quantitative
  analysis of peroxisome inheritance and division-related genes at transcriptional
  level. The total RNA of three strains (wild-type PH-1, ΔFgPex4, and ΔFgPex22-like)
  was obtained using the same method, and then a series of experiments and analyses
  were performed. GAPDH was used as an internal reference gene. (C) Relative quantitative
  analysis of PMP70 at the transcriptional level. Error bars on the histograms represent
  the standard error of three repeated tests. Different letters on the bars for each
  treatment indicate significant difference at p < 0.05 by Duncan’s multiple range
  test. All experiments were repeated three times with three replicates each time
