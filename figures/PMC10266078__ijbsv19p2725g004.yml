caption: CircRABL2B impoverishes lung cancer cell stemness via affecting pSrc-integrin
  β4-p53 axis. a Gene microarray identified a large number of target genes in A549
  and PC9 with circRABL2B overexpression versus vector control. b Enrichment analysis
  for top of 30 KEGG pathways in circRABL2B targets. c Gene set enrichment profile
  showing enrichment of the P53 signaling pathway for the circRABL2B overexpression
  group (circRABL2B) compared to the control group (vector). d Gene set enrichment
  profile showing enrichment of the P53 signaling pathway for the circRABL2B knock-down
  group (sh-circRABL2B) compared to the control group (sh-vector). NES normalized
  enrichment score, FDR false discovery rate. P values are calculated by permutation
  test. e Representative images and quantitative representation of percentage SP from
  SP analysis in A549 and PC9 with or without circRABL2B overexpression. n = 3 biologically
  independent samples for each cell line. f Representative micrographs showing the
  spheres by SP with or without circRABL2B overexpression. g WB showing a decrease
  in biomarkers of cancer stem cells in A549 and PC9 cells after circRABL2B overexpression.
  h WB showing circRABL2B disrupts integrin β4/pSrc/p53 axis. Two independent experiments
  were carried out with similar results in g and h. i circRABL2B overexpression by
  lentiviral transduction suppressed patient-derived LCOs at day 3 and day 7. Scale
  bar = 200 μm. Data are presented as Mean ± S.E. P values are calculated by unpaired
  t test in e, f, and i
