figure_title: MYCi975 plus cisplatin induces DNA damage and activates the cGAS‑STING-IRF3
  signaling pathway.
caption: MYCi975 plus cisplatin induces DNA damage and activates the cGAS‑STING-IRF3
  signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of p-H2A.X in HN6 and SCC15 cell under
  different conditions as indicated. H3 was used as the internal control. (B-D) Immunostaining
  and quantification of p-H2A.X (red) in HN6 and SCC15 cells under different conditions
  as indicated. Nuclei were stained using DAPI (blue). Means ± SD are shown from three
  independent experiments. Scale bar, 50 μm. **P < 0.01 using one-way ANOVA. (E-F)
  Representative images and quantification of DNA Comet assays in HN6 cells treated
  under different conditions as indicated. More than 100 cells were analyzed per group.
  Means ± SD are shown. Scale bar, 100 μm. ** P < 0.01 using one‑way ANOVA. (G-H)
  Confocal microscopy images showing cytosolic DNA accumulation and quantification
  in HN6 cells under different conditions as indicated. Double‑stranded DNA (dsDNA)
  was stained using PicoGreen (green). Mitochondria and nuclei were stained using
  MitoTracker (Red) and DAPI (blue), respectively. The white arrows indicate cytosolic
  dsDNA. Scale bar, 10 μm. More than 100 cells were analyzed per group. Means ± SD
  are shown. ** P < 0.01 using one-way ANOVA. (I) Western blot analysis of the phosphorylation
  of IRF3 (p-IRF3) in HN6 and SCC15 cells under different conditions as indicated.
  GAPDH was used as the internal control. (J‑L) Immunostaining and quantification
  of p-IRF3 (green) in HN6 and SCC15 cells under different conditions as indicated.
  Nuclei are stained using DAPI (blue). Means ± SD are shown from three independent
  experiments. Scale bar, 50 μm. *P < 0.05 and ** P < 0.01 using one-way ANOVA
