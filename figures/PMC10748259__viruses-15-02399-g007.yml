caption: Involvement of metabolism in viral genome detection. The study of the influence
  of metabolic pathways on the detection of viral pathogens reveals the intricate
  relationship between metabolic players and viral genome detection. The mTORC1 pathway
  and S6K, which is a part of this major signaling pathway, have shown their role
  in promoting cGAS/STING and TLR-dependent detection pathways. On the other hand,
  aerobic glycolysis and its final metabolite, lactate, interact negatively with the
  RLR-dependent detection pathway, notably by inhibiting MAVS
