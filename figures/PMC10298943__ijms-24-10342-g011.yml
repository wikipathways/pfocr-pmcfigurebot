caption: GATA signaling pathway prediction model in Phoebe bournei in adapting to
  drought and cold stress. Drought stress causes plants to create hyperosmotic stress
  and causes Ca2+ to enter cells, both of which induce ABA to accumulate and drought-related
  genes to express in plants, which leads to stomatal closure, allowing plants to
  enhance drought tolerance. Under cold stress, plants boost endogenous jasmonate
  synthesis, activate COI1 receptors, and target JAZ proteins for breakdown and MYC
  release. MYC activates downstream cold response genes via the GATA protein to increase
  cold tolerance
