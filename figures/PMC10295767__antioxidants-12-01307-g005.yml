caption: |-
  Inactivation of PM2.5-induced MAPK signaling pathway, the transcription factor AP-1 was performed by 3-BDB. (a,b) Cells were treated with 30 μΜ of 3-BDB for 1 h, and then the cells were stimulated by PM2.5 for 24 h, the proteins were separated from cells, and (a) phospho-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, ERK2, phospho-SEK1, SEK1, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-p38, p38, as well as (b) c-Fos, phospho-c-Jun, and c-Jun expressions were detected by Western blot. (a,b) * p < 0.05 and #
  p < 0.05 compared to control cells and PM2.5-exposed cells, respectively
