figure_title: Mapping and classification of Cd-related genes.
caption: 'Mapping and classification of Cd-related genes. (A) is a bar chart of GO
  classification statistics (single gene set): In the figure, the vertical axis represents
  the second-level classification terms of GO, the horizontal axis represents the
  number of genes compared to the second-level classification, and the three colors
  represent the three classifications. (B) is the enrichment diagram of the KEGG signal
  pathway. Ordinate is the name of the KEGG metabolic pathway. The x-coordinate is
  the number of genes or transcripts annotated to this pathway. The upper right corner
  shows the category of KEGG metabolic pathways'
