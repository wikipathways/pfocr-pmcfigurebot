caption: Schematic representation of the main modulations, at the metabolite and transcript
  levels, of the phenolamide biosynthesis in response to the herbivory of T. absoluta.
  Genes in orange were shown to be up-regulated upon T. absoluta herbivory through
  RNAseq and/or qPCR. The three phenolamide categories in red were shown to be over-accumulated
  upon T. absoluta herbivory. The blue arrows in solid line represent metabolic steps
  in the phenylpropanoid and polyamine/monoamine pathways. The light-blue arrows in
  dashed lines connect the phenylpropanoid and polyamine/monoamine substrates to lead
  to the synthesis of the three categories of phenolamides catalyzed by three types
  of enzymes, THT, PHT and a yet unknown enzyme. ADC, arginine decarboxylase; ODC,
  ornithine decarboxylase; SPDS, spermidine synthase; SPMS, spermine synthase; PAL,
  phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate CoEnzyme
  A ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl quinate/shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase;
  C3′H, coumaroyl-3′-hydroxylase; HQT, hydroxycinnamoyl quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase;
  TYDC, tyrosine decarboxylase; PHT, putrescine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; THT,
  tyramine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase.
