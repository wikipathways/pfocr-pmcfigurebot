caption: Design and Preparation of the Supramolecular Peptide HBBplus@CA. (A) Bioinformatics
  analysis of the function of Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in metastatic
  melanoma. In the GSE30219 cohort, Univariate Cox regression analysis of CTNNB1 and
  MAPK15 for metastatic melanoma. CTNNB1 was positively associated with MAPK15. (B)
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways promote the tumor
  metastasis process. (C) Western blot analysis for the expressions of β-catenin,
  np-β-catenin, and c-Myc proteins after CA treatment or the terms of ERK1/2/p-ERK1/2
  after HBBplus treatment in B16F10 cells. (D) Synthesis and schematic of HBBplus@CA
  particles. (E) TEM image of HBBplus-assembled nanoclusters induced by different
  concentrations of CA. (F) Size distribution of HBBplus-assembled nanoclusters induced
  by different concentrations of CA, measured by DLS. (G) HRTEM and elemental analysis
  by electron micrographs of HBBplus@CA formed by self-assembly of CA and peptides
  in a 1:1 ratio configuration. The data were presented as mean ± s.d. *, p < 0.05;
  **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001
