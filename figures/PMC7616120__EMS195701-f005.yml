figure_title: ADAMTSs crosstalk with signalling pathways regulates cancer progression
caption: A. ADAMTS1, 6, 10 and 16 can activate TGFβ by cleaving the ECM-bound LAP
  domain, leading to promotion of TGFβ signalling that drives EMT and cell migration.B.
  In CRC, ADAMTS12 activates the Wnt signalling pathway while ADAMTS8 and 18 inhibit
  Wnt activation, potentially by stabilising Wnt in the ECM.C. ADAMTS6, 12, 15 and
  18 inhibit ERK signalling potentially by regulating EGFR activation, in different
  cancer types.D. AKT activation is negatively regulated by ADAMTS8 and 18, in oesophageal
  cancer and LC respectively.NFκB is negatively regulated by ADAMTS16 and 19 in GC,
  leading to decreased invasion and proliferation of cancer cells. ADAMTSs have been
  colour coded based on cancer type, light yellow for LC; dark blue for CRC; pink
  for BC; salmon for oesophageal cancer and purple for GC. Image generated with elements
