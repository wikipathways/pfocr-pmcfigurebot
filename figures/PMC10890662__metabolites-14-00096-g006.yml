figure_title: Stereochemical structures of potential Glc–GA compounds and their locations
  in the GA biosynthetic and inactive pathways.
caption: Stereochemical structures of potential Glc–GA compounds and their locations
  in the GA biosynthetic and inactive pathways. Compounds in red are possible Glc–GAs
  in a known metabolic pathway. Compounds in blue are Glc–GAs in an unknown metabolic
  pathway. Solid lines indicate known GA metabolic pathways. Dotted lines indicate
  possible GA glycosylation processes. The wavy bonds represent unclear anomers. The
  superscript number in the compound name (Glc–GAX) is the corresponding number of
  possible Glucose–conjugated forms of GAX
