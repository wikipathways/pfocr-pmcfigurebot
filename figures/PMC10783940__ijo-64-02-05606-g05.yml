caption: Identification of DEGs between the parental cells and their FABP5- or AR-KO
  derivatives and the relevant pathways. (A) Top up (red)- or down (green)-regulated
  40 DEGs identified from analysis of the microarray heatmaps of 22RV1 and 22RV1-FABP5-KO
  cells. Red color represents 'up'. (B) Top 30 pathways associated with DEGs with
  the 22RV1-FABP5-KO cells were revealed by the enrichment bar chart method. (C) Top
  up (red)- or down (green)-regulated 40 DEGs from analysis of microarray heatmaps
  of 22RV1 and 22RV1-AR-KO cells. (D) The top 30 pathways associated with the DEGs
  in 22RV1-AR-KO cells were identified by the enrichment bar chart method. (E) Top
  up (red)- or down (green)-regulated 40 DEGs identified by analysis of microarray
  heatmaps of the DU145 and DU145-FABP5-KO cells. (F) Enrichment bar chart, revealing
  the top 30 pathways associated with DEGs of DU145-FABP5-KO cells. DEGs, differentially
  expressed genes; KO, knockout; FABP5, fatty acid-binding protein 5; AR, androgen
  receptor
