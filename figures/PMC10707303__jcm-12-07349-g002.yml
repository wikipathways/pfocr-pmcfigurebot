figure_title: Role of metabolic factors in the development of DKD.
caption: 'Role of metabolic factors in the development of DKD. The diagram depicts
  the impact of metabolic disruptions in hyperglycemia on various pathways, namely
  PKC, AGE, hexosamine, and the polyol pathway. The PKC pathway is linked to heightened
  production of ECM, especially collagen IV, leading to the expansion of mesangial
  cells and the development of glomerulosclerosis. The interaction between AGE and
  RAGE triggers downstream signaling molecules, including MAPK, p38, SAPK/JNK, ERK1/2,
  and JAK/STAT. The hexosamine pathway is responsible for generating glucosamine-6-p,
  which in turn promotes the release of cytokines such as TGF-β, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, TNF-α,
  CTGF, and PAI-1. The polyol pathway results in a redox imbalance between NADH and
  NAD+ in diabetes mellitus. Collectively, these processes contribute to the progression
  of DKD. Abbreviations: DKD: diabetic kidney disease, glucosamine-6-P: glucosamine-6-phosphate,
  PKC: protein kinase C, AGE: advanced glycation end products, ECM: extracellular
  matrix, RAGE: receptor for advanced glycation end products, SAPK/JNK: stress-activated
  protein kinases/Jun amino-terminal kinases, ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2, JAK/STAT: Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription,
  TGF-β: transforming growth factor- β, ICAM-1: intercellular adhesion molecule 1,
  VCAM-1: vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha, CTGF:
  connective tissue growth factor, PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor 1'
