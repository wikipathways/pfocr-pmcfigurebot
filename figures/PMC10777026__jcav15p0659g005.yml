  pathway.
caption: Imatinib induces OSCC cell apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
  (A) The expressions of PI3K and p-PI3K were examined by IHC analysis (100Ã— magnification).
  (B) PI3K, p-PI3K AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, and p-mTOR expression levels were determined
  through Western blotting. (C) Imatinib induces OSCC cell apoptosis and suppression
  via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
