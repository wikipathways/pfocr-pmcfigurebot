caption: The effect of rotenone on regulating the Nrf2 signaling pathway and induction
  of Parkinson’s disease was proposed. Rotenone/ROS induces mitochondrial damage and
  change in mitochondrial proteins (PINK1/Parkin (PARK 2). A-synuclein aggregation
  and apoptosis are the main prognoses for the onset of Parkinson's disease
