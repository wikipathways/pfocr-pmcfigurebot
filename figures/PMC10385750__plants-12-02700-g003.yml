figure_title: Statistical description of metabolic analysis of coix seed germination.
caption: Statistical description of metabolic analysis of coix seed germination. (a),
  Principal Component Score (PCA) analysis of metabolome sequencing results. The X-axis
  represents the first principal component (PC1), and the Y-axis represents the second
  principal component (PC2). (b), Statistical description of metabolic analysis of
  coix seed germination. (c), The KEGG pathways of all DEGs of germinated seeds and
  controls. The abscissa is the type of KEGG enrichment, and the ordinate is the percent
  of differentially expressed genes in different KEGG
