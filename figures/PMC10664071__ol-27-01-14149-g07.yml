  pathway in lung cancer cells.
caption: TREM1 could inhibit lung cancer progression via the Toll-like receptor pathway
  in lung cancer cells. (A) TREM1 expression in lung cancer cell lines. (B) The protein
  expression of TREM1 in lung cancer cell lines was detected by western blot. (C)
  The overexpression efficiency of TREM1 in lung cancer cell lines. (D) Overexpression
  efficiency of the TREM1 gene in A549 and H1299 cells was detected by western blotting.
  (E and F) The effect of overexpressed TREM1 on cell proliferation. The effect of
  overexpressed TREM1 on cell invasion and migration in (G and H) H1299 and (I and
  J) A549 cell lines. The expression levels of MyD88, TLR2 and TLR4 were downregulated
  by overexpression of TREM1 in (K) A549 and (L) H1299 cells. (M) The protein bands
  show the regulation of MyD88, TLR2 and TLR4 by overexpressed TREM1. Scale, 10 µm.
