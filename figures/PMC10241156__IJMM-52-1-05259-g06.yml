caption: The activation of the AMPK/mTOR or PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathways promotes
  autophagy and ERS in ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells treated with G-Rg1. (A) The expression
  of LC3 in ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells co-treated with G-Rg1 and AICAR was detected
  using GFP-LC3 assay. (B) The protein expression levels of LC3-I, LC3-II, Beclin-1
  and p62 were measured in ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells co-treated with G-Rg1 and
  AICAR using western blot analysis. (C) The expression of CHOP was evaluated in ethanol-stimulated
  H9c2 cells co-treated with G-Rg1 and CCT020312 using immunofluorescence staining.
  (D) The expression levels of ERS-related proteins in ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells
  co-treated with G-Rg1 and CCT020312 were determined using western blot analysis.
  The results are expressed as the mean ± SD. The experiments were repeated three
  times. ***P<0.001. G-Rg1, ginsenoside Rg1; ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress; AMPK,
