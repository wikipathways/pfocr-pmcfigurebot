caption: Differential gene expression of hedgehog signaling pathway genes in BCC tissue
  (in blue) compared to healthy skin tissue (in red). BCC tissues with no somatic
  mutations in PTCH1 and low As exposure are shown on the left upper plot (A). BCC
  tissues with somatic mutations in PTCH1 and low As exposure are shown on the right
  upper plot (B). BCC tissues with no somatic mutations in PTCH1 and high As exposure
  are shown on the left lower plot (C). BCC tissues with somatic mutations in PTCH1
  and high As exposure are shown on the right lower plot (D). Genes are arranged on
  the x-axis by expression level, and the log2-transformed gene count per million
  (CPM) is shown on the y-axis. Gene symbols for all the genes could not be shown
  on the x-axis
