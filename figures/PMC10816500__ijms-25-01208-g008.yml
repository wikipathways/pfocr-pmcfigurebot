caption: CellChat-inferred cell–cell communication networks reveal the functional
  heterogeneity of ELG immune cell populations. (A) Circle network plots displaying
  the number of interactions between cells, generated using CellChat. The thickness
  of the lines is proportional to the number of interactions between cells. The size
  of the nodes is proportional to the number of different cell types. (B) Circle network
  plots display the weights/strength of interactions between cells, generated using
  CellChat. The thickness of the lines is proportional to the weights/strength of
  interactions between cells. (C) Visualization of the primary senders and receivers
  in a 2D spatial context generated by CellChat demonstrates the interactions between
  cells. (D) Dot plots display the most important outgoing (left) and incoming (right)
  signaling patterns in ELG immune cell clusters. The size of the dots is proportional
  to the contribution score obtained from pattern recognition analysis. A higher contribution
  score indicates a richer signaling pathway in the corresponding cell clusters. (E)
  Heatmaps display the inferred communication network of the Thy1 signaling pathway
  among all cell types, where darker colors represent stronger involvement of the
  corresponding signaling pathway in the cell clusters. Violin plots show the distribution
  of signal gene expression in each signaling network. (F) Heatmaps display the inferred
  communication network of the APP signaling pathway among all cell types, where darker
  colors represent stronger involvement of the corresponding signaling pathway in
  the cell clusters. Violin plots show the distribution of signal gene expression
  in each signaling network
