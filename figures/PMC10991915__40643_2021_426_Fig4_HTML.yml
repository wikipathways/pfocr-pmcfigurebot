caption: Regulation of genes involved in central carbon metabolism. This image shows
  central carbon metabolic pathways, including the Calvin cycle, gluconeogenesis,
  glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The red
  plus sign indicates upregulation, the blue minus sign indicates downregulation,
  and the black sign indicates no significant difference. The front and back positions
  indicate the differential expression at day 5 and day 15, respectively. The regions
  in red and blue indicate the upregulation and downregulation of the overall pathway,
  respectively. Abbreviations for metabolites were shown in black. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; MAL, malate; Pyr, pyruvate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; 1,3-2PG,
  3-phospho-glycerol phosphate; G-3-P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; F-1,6-2P, fructose
  1,6-bisphosphate; F-6-P, fructose 6-phosphate; G-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; G-1-P,

  iCIT, isocitrate; α-KG, 2-oxo-glutarate; Suc-CoA, succinyl-CoA; SUC, succinate;
  FUM, fumarate. Abbreviations for enzymes were shown in gray. PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase; ME, malic enzyme (malate dehydrogenase); PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FBA, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase;
