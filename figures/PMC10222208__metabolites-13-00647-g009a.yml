figure_title: Functional analysis of GO enrichment of iWAT differentially Kla-upregulated
  protein.
caption: Functional analysis of GO enrichment of iWAT differentially Kla-upregulated
  protein. (A) iWAT Kla-upregulated protein enriched citrate cycle pathway; (B) iWAT
  Kla-upregulated protein enriched pyruvate metabolic pathway; (C) iWAT Kla-upregulated
  protein enriched glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway; and (D) iWAT Kla-upregulated
  protein enriched oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The names of the proteins in
  the red squares are Kla up-regulated proteins. The original KEGG pathway diagram
