  function.
caption: 'NRF2 activated the ATR/CHK1 pathway independent of its transcriptional function.
  A, B Western blotting of NRF2 in A549 and H1299 cells treated with different doses
  of 137Cs γ-rays (2, 4, 8 Gy) for 8 h. C, D Western blotting of NRF2 in A549 and
  H1299 cells exposed to 8 Gy 137Cs γ-rays for different time durations. E Western
  blotting of NRF2 binding to chromatin under damage induced by different doses of
  137Cs γ-rays (2, 4, 8 Gy) in A549 cells. F Immunofluorescence analysis of NRF2 (red)
  at the site of DNA damage (γ-H2AX: green) in A549 and H1703 cells caused by laser
  microirradiation. The nuclei were visualized using DAPI staining (blue). Scale bar:
  10 μm and 5 μm. G Western blotting of ATR, p-ATR, NRF2, 53BP1, BRCA1, CHK1, and
  p-CHK1 in H1299R cells transfected with siNRF2, siBRCA1, or si53BP1 and treated
  with 30 nM CPT for 6 h. H Schematic illustration of the HA-tagged NRF2 mutants.
  I Western blotting of p-ATR, NRF2, p-CHK1, and CHK1 in A549 cells, A549-NRF2KO,
  A549-NRF2KO+NRF2, and A549-NRF2KO+Δ434-561-NRF2 exposed to 8 Gy γ-rays for 8 h.
