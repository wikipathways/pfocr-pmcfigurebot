caption: Summary of relevant SLs and their relative abundances in Leishmania amastigotes
  and murine host macrophages and potential salvage and metabolic routes.Leishmania
  amastigotes lack de novo sphingoid base (SB) synthesis so SL synthetic and/or salvage
  pathways are shown starting at this point. The spectrum of SLs considered is restricted
  to SLs with C16 and C18 fatty acyl chains relevant to IPC synthesis and is based
  on the present study or published data (, ) (). The structures of ceramides or the
  ceramide anchor of SMs and IPCs is shown, with larger font heights signifying approximate
  relative abundance. The host ceramide or SM anchors are colored to match those of
  the Leishmania IPCs to facilitate discussion about potential host origins. Question
  marks indicate lack of information about the relative role of the indicated pathway
  in IPC synthesis. The heavy dashed black arrow marks the highly abundant d18:1/16:0-SM
  in both Leishmania amastigotes and the host and is discussed further in the text.
  IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide; SL, sphingolipid; SM, sphingomyelin.

  virulent in animal infections where salvage of host sphingomyelin predominates.
