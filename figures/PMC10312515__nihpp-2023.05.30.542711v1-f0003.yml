figure_title: The Trop-2-Q118E-EYFP lack of secretion phenotype is restored in HEK
  293T UGGT1−/− cells re-complemented with the UGGT1 gene
caption: '(A) UGGT1 and UGGT1 D1454A re-complementation does not interfere with the
  localisation of the WT Trop-2-EYFP glycoprotein (green): the protein traverses the
  secretory pathway and reaches the plasma membrane (white arrowheads); (B) In re-complemented
  WT cells, the Trop-2-Q118E-EYFP mutant glycoprotein (green) is absent from the plasma
  membrane and is retained in the secretory pathway (top first and second rows). In
  the UGGT1 re-complemented UGGT1−/− cells, we observe restoration of the original
  lack of secretion phenotype observed for Trop-2Q118E-EYFP in WT cells: the Trop-2-Q118E-EYFP
  mutant glycoprotein does not reach the cellular membrane (third row). Consistently
  with these observations, we still observe the rescue of secretion of the mutant
  glycoprotein in UGGT1−/− cells recomplemented with the inactive UGGT1 D1454A mutant
  (bottom row, white arrowheads). (C) Multichannel intensity plots of the Trop-2-EYFP
  transfected recomplemented cell lines confirm our visual observations (black arrowheads)'
