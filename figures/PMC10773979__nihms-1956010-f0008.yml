figure_title: A diagrammatic model illustrating the proposed mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D3
  mitigates RSV-induced dysfunction of the epithelial barrier
caption: RSV infects the airway epithelial cells, leading to AJC disassembly and impairing
  the integrity of the epithelial barrier. 1,25 (OH)2D3 can exert its effects through
  both genomic and non-genomic pathways. In the genomic pathway, 1,25 (OH)2D3 binds
  to vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the cytoplasm, forming a heterodimer with the retinoid-X
  receptor (RXR), and translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription.
  In the non-genomic pathway, 1,25(OH)2D3 binds to membrane VDR, which activates second
  messenger signaling pathways to rapidly modulate cellular processes. When administered
  before RSV infection, 1,25 (OH)2D3 activates the PKA signaling pathway through undetermined
  mechanisms (indicated by the dashed arrow), which in return protects epithelial
  cells against disrupted structure and increased permeability caused by RSV infection.
