caption: MDMA acts as an inhibitor of NET, DAT, SERT and of VMAT2, resulting in increased
  levels of the three monoamines DA, NE, and 5HT. The latter consequently increases
  the blood levels of prolactin, DHEA, oxytocin, and cortisol. MDMA also binds D1-D2
  receptors and acts as an agonist of H1, 5HT2A, and B receptors. Its effects are
  also explained by the interaction with TAAR1, alpha2, and Sigma1. S- and R-ketamines
  increase glutamate release into the synaptic cleft, activating AMPAR and contributing
  to further synaptogenesis and dendritogenesis. S-ketamine binds NMDARs expressed
  in GABAergic interneurons, leading to a depolarization of cortical excitatory neurons.
  This depolarization causes glutamate and BDNF release, which bind to TrkB receptors.
  TrkB activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway, leading to the upregulation of synaptogenesis
  and dendritogenesis. S-ketamine binds to extrasynaptic NMDARs, disinhibiting mTORC1
  signaling by deactivating eEFK2. Binding to mu-opioid receptors may facilitate antidepressant
  effects. R-ketamine affects microglial signaling and, by increasing BDNF release
  through TrkB, activates the ERK signaling pathway, resulting in synaptogenesis and
  dendritogenesis
