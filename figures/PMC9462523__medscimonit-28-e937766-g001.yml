caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway
  is triggered by the binding of a particular death ligand to death receptor, leading
  to its trimerization and the consequent recruitment of procaspase-8, which is subsequently
  activated. In contrast, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway starts in response to apoptotic
  stimuli that induce pro-apoptotic proteins, such as B-cell lymphoma 2-associated
  X protein (Bax), triggering the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane,
  and the consequent release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it contributes
  to the formation of a multimeric apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf-1)/cytochrome
  c complex that recruits procaspase-9, forming the apoptosome. Hence, procaspase-9
  is activated and consequently detached from the complex. Ultimately, active caspase-8
  and active caspase-9 activate executioner caspases-3, -6, and/or -7, which mediate
  apoptosis. This figure was adapted with permission from John Wiley and Sons, from
