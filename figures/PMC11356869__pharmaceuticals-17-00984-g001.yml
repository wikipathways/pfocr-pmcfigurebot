figure_title: Signaling pathways in osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis.
caption: Signaling pathways in osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Osteoblasts produce
  RANKL that is either neutralized by circulating OPG or triggers a signaling cascade
  involving TRAF6 and MAPK which activates transcription factors (NFATc1 and NF-κB)
  for bone resorption. SMAD-dependent BMP signaling involves a complex containing
  Smad4 which translocate into the nucleus to trigger osteogenesis. SMAD4 also binds
  to FZD promoter and activates Wnt signaling pathways [64]. Binding of Wnt ligand
  to frizzled (FZD) receptors initiates Wnt β-catenin signaling pathway. Ligand binding
  activates adenylate cyclase (AC) that convert ATP to cAMP which ultimately binds
  to protein kinase A (PKA) to phosphorylate cAMP response element binding protein
  (CREB) at Ser133 site to control gene expression
