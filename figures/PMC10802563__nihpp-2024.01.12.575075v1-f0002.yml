figure_title: IF1-KO cells with increased ΔΨM engage in a transcriptional feedback
  loop repressing mitochondrial genetic program
caption: 'A) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IF1-KO vs. WT (False
  Discovery Rate, FDR < 0.05). The color scheme is presented as a log2 fold change
  (log2FC). Shades of red represent upregulated genes (log2FC > 0) and shades of blue
  represent downregulated genes (log2FC < 0). B) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of DEGs
  in IF1-KO vs. WT cells. −Log10 FDR values on the y-axis, and combined score on the
  x-axis. In bigger blue circles, significantly enriched pathways (FDR < 0.05) related
  to mitochondria. In smaller translucid blue and grey circles, other significantly
  enriched pathways (FDR < 0.05) and non-significant pathways (FDR > 0.05), respectively.
  C) Structural depiction of individual complexes of the electron transport chain
  and mitochondrial ribosomes. The number of DEGs associated with these broad complexes
  and their transcriptional directionality are also depicted. D) Functional Annotation
  Clustering of common DEGs reciprocally changed in the inverse direction between
  IF1-KO vs. WT and IF1-RSC vs. IF1-KO. Keywords and terms found in each cluster are
  shown on the y-axis and the Enrichment score is on the x-axis. E) Venn diagrams
  shown the intersection between reciprocally regulated DEGs in IF1-KO vs. WT and
  IF1-RSC vs IF1-KO. Upper circles: upregulated DEGs based on IF1-KO vs. WT comparison,
  lower circles represent the downregulated counterparts. F and G) GO analysis of
  reciprocally regulated DEGs in IF1-KO cells, as depicted and described in B. H)
  Heatmap of representative pathways reversed in IF1-RSC vs. IF1-KO as identified
  by GO analysis. Color scheme as described in A. KO is IF1-KO vs. WT, and RSC is
  IF1-RSC vs. IF1-KO'
