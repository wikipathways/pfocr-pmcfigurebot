  signaling pathway.
caption: DLBCL-derived exosomal ENO2 regulated macrophages glycolysis via GSK3β/β-catenin/c-Myc
  signaling pathway. A-B. The protein expression levels of p-GSK3β (Ser9), β-catenin
  and c-Myc were detected in THP-1 macrophages stimulated by exosomes from different
  ENO2 stably transfected DLBCL cells; ICG001 can decrease the protein expression
  levels of β-catenin and c-Myc in THP-1 macrophages; SKL2001 can increase the protein
  expression levels of β-catenin and c-Myc in THP-1 macrophages. THP-1 macrophages
  were treated with ICG001 or SKL2001 for 1 h and then stimulated by exosomes from
  DLBCL cells for 24 h. Glycolysis-related indicators were detected. C. Glucose consumption
  of THP-1 macrophages. D. ATP production of THP-1 macrophages. E. Lactate production
  of THP-1 macrophages. F-G. ECAR of THP-1 macrophages. Data were shown as the mean±SD.
