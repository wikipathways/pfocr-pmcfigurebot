figure_title: Significant perturbations of major metabolites and genes in arginine
  synthesis and degradation pathways
caption: (A) Arginine synthesis pathway.(B) Arginine degradation pathway.(Ai and Bi)
  Metabolites.(Aii and Bii) Genes.A total of 4 biological replicates were conducted
  in the metabolomics study and 3 biological replicates in the transcriptomics study.
  All data are represented as mean Â± SD. S, wild-type polymyxin-susceptible strains
  (no colistin treatment); D, polymyxin-dependent strains (no colistin treatment);
  DC, polymyxin-dependent strains treated with 16 mg/L colistin for 2 h
