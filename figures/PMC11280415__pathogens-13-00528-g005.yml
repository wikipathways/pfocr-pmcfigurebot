caption: Top canonical pathways activated in the SARS-CoV-2-infected brain. (A) Graphical
  abstracts were generated for the overall changes in gene expression patterns using
  ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) at days 3 (D3) and 6 (D6) after infection. (B)
  Comparative canonical pathways and (C) individual analyses for disease and disorders
  in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection were generated using IPA tools. The orange line
  indicates the default p value significance threshold of 0.05
