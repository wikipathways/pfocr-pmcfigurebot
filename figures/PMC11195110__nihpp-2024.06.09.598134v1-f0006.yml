figure_title: Genes involved in metabolism and inflammation are differentially expressed
  in follicles cultured in stiff environments
caption: (A) Graph showing the total number of differentially expressed genes (DEG)
  between the 0.5% and 2% alginate encapsulated follicles at the indicated time points.
  (B) Volcano plot showing DEGs in follicles cultured in 2% alginate compared to those
  cultured in 0.5% at 3h. (C, D) Graphs showing GO analysis of downregulated (C) and
  upregulated (D) DEGs in 2% alginate gels compared to 0.5% at 3h. (E) Volcano plot
  showing DEGs in follicles cultured in 2% alginate compared to those cultured in
  0.5% at 6h. (F,G) Graphs showing GO analysis of downregulated (F) and upregulated
  (G) DEGs in 2% alginate gels compared to 0.5% at 6h. (H) Graph showing the GSEA
  analysis of mechanosensory behavior pathway and its associated genes. Red indicates
  over-represented genes and blue indicates under-represented genes
