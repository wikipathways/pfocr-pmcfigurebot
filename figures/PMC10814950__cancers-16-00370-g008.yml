caption: Key signalling pathways targeted by a combination of PI3Ki (PIK-75) and CDKi
  (dinaciclib). Dinaciclib inhibits the progression through the cell cycle by supressing
  the signalling of CDK2 (G1/S and S/G2 transition) and CDK1 (G2/M transition) and
  stalling at the respective checkpoints. PIK-75, a dual inhibitor of DNA−PK and PI3K,
  also can promote cell cycle arrest in G2− or G1−phase via the induction of DNA damage
  or through interference with CDK4/6 (AKT−GSK−3β−CDK4/6 axis), respectively. Independently
  of the cell cycle modulating effect of PIK-75, PIK-75 can inhibit cell motility
  and reduce cell survival by decreasing phospho−AKT levels. Red crosses indicate
  cellular perturbation elicited by the drug treatment
