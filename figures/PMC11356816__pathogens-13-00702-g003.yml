caption: 'Interactions between BAs and Clostridioides difficile. PBAs (A) promote
  the spore germination of C. difficile. SBAs (B) bind to FXR and TGR5 receptors,
  activating NF-ÎºB and other signaling pathways, enhancing innate immunity, and inhibiting
  the growth of C. difficile, and (C) interact with the C-terminus of toxin TcdB directly,
  inducing toxin structural changes, and preventing toxin binding with host cells.
  C. difficile (D) promotes the release of C. difficile toxins TcdA and TcdB and (E)
  induces intestinal inflammation. PBA: primary bile acid; SBA: secondary bile acid;
  FXR: Farnesoid X Receptor; TGR5: Takeda G Protein-Coupled Receptor 5; C. difficile:
  Clostridioides difficile'
