figure_title: The TNFR1 signal transduction pathway
caption: Upon engagement of TNFR1, complex I is rapidly formed and mediates the signaling
  to NF-κB activation. The ubiquitination mediated by E3 ligases, like cellular inhibitor
  of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) or cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2)
  and linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), promotes the association of
  complex I. The Ub modification is required for full activation of the inhibitor
  of NF-κB (IκB) and subsequent NF-κB activation. Activated NF-κB in the nucleus initiates
  the expression of target genes like IκB, A20, cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein
  (cFLIPL), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
  (XIAP). A20 is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), which is reported to cleave lysine
  63 (K63) chains while protecting methionine 1 (M1) chains from cleavage. The deubiquitination
  by CYLD (cylindromatosis) destabilizes the complex and promotes the formation of
  complex II in the cytosol. Complex IIa associates caspase 8 (CASP8), while complex
  IIb additionally binds RIP1. cFLIPL reduces, but does not fully inhibit, caspase
  activity, which leads to RIP1 and RIP3 cleavage and inhibits apoptosis and necroptosis.
  cFLIPS fully inhibits caspase activity and promotes the formation of the necrosome.
  Autophosphorylation of RIP3 allows the recruitment and phosphorylation of MLKL,
  which subsequently forms active oligomers and translocates to the plasma membrane
  to induce necroptosis.
