caption: 'Analysis of ABA-dependent signaling pathway genes under drought stress.
  (a) Correlation analysis of 9 PYLs in drought and ABA transcriptome. D_0h, D_2h,
  D_4h and D_8h represented drought treatment at 0, 2, 4 and 8h, respectively. ABA1_0h,
  ABA1_2h, ABA1_4h and ABA1_8h represented ABA treatment of 50 Î¼mol/L at 0, 2, 4 and
  8h, respectively. FPKM values of unigenes were transformed by log2, and row cluster
  analysis was used. (b) Phylogenetic tree of 6 unigenes annotated SmSnRK2s with SnRK2
  members of A. thaliana. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining
  method by MEGA11 software. The numerals next to the branch nodes indicate bootstrap
  values from 1000 replications. AtSnRKs were downloaded from the Arabidopsis database:
  AtSnRK2.1 (AT5G08590), AtSnRK2.2 (AT3G50500), AtSnRK2.3 (AT5G66880), AtSnRK2.4 (AT1G10940),
  AtSnRK2.5 (AT5G63650), AtSnRK2.6 (AT4G33950), AtSnRK2.7 (AT4G40010), AtSnRK2.8 (AT1G78290),
  AtSnRK2.9 (AT2G23030) and AtSnRK2.10 (AT1G60940)'
