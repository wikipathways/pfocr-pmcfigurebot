figure_title: Characterization of cell-type-specific ACRs, motif and TFs
caption: (A) Number of ctACRs identified in each tissue. (B) Proportion of ACRs that
  overlap with TEs and TE enrichment in all ctACRs. (C) TE enrichment in ctACRs for
  each cell type. (D) Heatmap of TF motif enrichment across 103 cell types. (E) UMAP
  embeddings overlaid with gene expression of GmMYB118 (top row) or TF motif deviation
  score of the MYB118 binding motif (bottom row) across four developmental stages
  of seeds. (F) Image of a root with nodules (left) and an illustration of major cell
  types and the gene regulatory pathway in infected cells of developing nodules. (G)
  UMAP embeddings overlaid with gene expression of GmNLP7a and TF motif deviation
  score of NLP7 in nodule tissue. (H-J) Pseudobulk cell type Tn5 integration site
  coverage pattern around gene body (top), UMAP embedding overlaid motif deviation
  score (middle) and gene expression (bottom) for GmNSP1(H), GmNIN2a (I) and GmNF-YA1a
  (J). (K-L) UMAP embedding overlaid TF motif deviation score for de novo motifs of
  STREME-7 and STREME-9
