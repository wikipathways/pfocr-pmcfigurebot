figure_title: Biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed biosynthesis of clovibactin
caption: The gene cluster associated with the biosynthesis of clovibactin was identified
  via whole genome sequencing and contained two nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS)
  genes (cloA and cloB), a transporter gene (cloC) and a tailoring enzyme (cloD).
  Proposed biosynthetic pathway of clovibactin involves the assembly-line condensation
  of 8 canonical amino acids with 3 epimerizations carried out by dual-function condensation
  domains and a Î²-hydroxylation on Asn5 by the CloD, a TauD/TfdA dioxygenase. This
  hydroxylation provides the cyclization point for release from the NRPS and formation
  of the macrocyclic lactone
