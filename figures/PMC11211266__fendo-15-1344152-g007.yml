caption: Comparison of predicted metabolic pathway abundance in gut microbiomes from
  children with Overweight/Obesity (OWO) and children with Overweight/Obesity (OWO)
  and Children with Normal Weight (NW). Through the columnar visualization, we get
  a clearer view of the pathway distributions, making it simpler to contrast and compare
  across the weight classifications and the two NGS technologies.

  sleep apnea: assessing the efficacy of 16S rRNA gene sequencing in metabolic function
  prediction based on weight status.'
