figure_title: Contribution of CAFs to inflammation-induced EMT in lung cancer CAFs
  secrete a variety of EMT-inducing factors, including insulin-like growth factor
  1 (IGF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), CXCL12,
  TGF-β, and extracellular vesicles (EVs).
caption: Contribution of CAFs to inflammation-induced EMT in lung cancer CAFs secrete
  a variety of EMT-inducing factors, including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),
  hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), CXCL12, TGF-β,
  and extracellular vesicles (EVs). The IGF-1 and HGF signaling pathways are dependent
  on annexin A2 (ANXA2) phosphorylation. Autophagy-induced secretion of HMGB1 by CAFs
  induces EMT via the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. CXCL12 triggers CXCR4/β-catenin
  to upregulate EMT-associated genes, among which peroxisome proliferator activated
  receptor delta (PPARδ) plays a specific role. CAF-derived EVs carry the EMT-TF Snail
  and miR-210, which induces the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway through UPF1 inhibition
