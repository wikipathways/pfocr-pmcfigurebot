figure_title: Key enzymes involved in R.
caption: Key enzymes involved in R. chrysanthum’s reaction to UV-B exposure were analyzed
  using the KEGG pathway method, and correlations between key enzymes and metabolites
  were examined. (a,b) Key enzymes’ KEGG bubble and bar graphs; (c) links between
  proteins and metabolomes. Proteins are represented by triangles, metabolites by
  circles, and positive relationships by solid yellow lines
