figure_title: A schematic overview of various ferredoxin (ptFd) and ferredoxin-NADP+
  reductase (ptFNR)-dependent metabolic pathways in the apicoplast
caption: ptFd reduction is catalyzed by NADPH-dependent enzyme ptFNR and could donate
  electrons (e−) to four other FeS- proteins, and probably to early steps of FeS synthesis
  itself. The NADP transhydrogenase (NTH) is suggested to provide NADPH for ptFd reduction
  by ptFNR. The SUF FeS synthesis pathway uses a cysteine desulfurase to mobilize
  sulfur from the available cysteine pool and transfer it to the scaffold protein
  complex with the aid of a relay protein. FeS cofactors formed on the scaffold complex
  are transferred to target proteins (light red) by the carrier proteins. Two proteins,
  IspG and IspH, that receive electrons from ptFd are the last two enzymes of the
  essential MEP pathway. The glycolytic metabolites pyruvate (Pyr) and glyceraldehyde-3
  phosphate (GA3P) are substrates for the MEP pathway and thought to be imported by
  apicoplast transporters. In seven subsequent enzymatic reactions the substrates
  are converted into IPP and DMAPP. DXPR is the target of Fosmidomycin (Fos). Other
  ptFd/FNR-dependent proteins are LipA (lipoate synthase) of the lipoate synthesis
  pathway and MiaB (tRNA-i6A37 methylthiotransferase) responsible for ms2i6A (2-methylthiol-N6-isopentenyl
  adenosine) tRNA modification. DOXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; DXPR, DOXP-reductoisomerase;
