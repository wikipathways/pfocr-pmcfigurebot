caption: 'Schematic illustration depicting the potential anti-inflammatory effects
  of hypolipidemic agents primarily targeting LDL-C reduction. (A). Typically, HMGCR
  facilitates the activation of TLRs, which subsequently triggers the expression of
  inflammasome-related genes through the NF-kB signaling pathway. This leads to inflammasome
  formation and the activation of caspase-1 protein, resulting in the maturation of
  several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a. TNF-a promotes the adhesion
  of various molecules, such as VCAM-1 and E-selectin, contributing to endothelial
  dysfunction. Statins may exert anti-inflammatory effects either by inhibiting HMGCR
  or by enhancing the expression of PXR, a receptor commonly found in the vasculature.
  Activation of PXR reduces the expression of these adhesion molecules, thus promoting
  vascular detoxification and reducing vascular inflammation. (B). PCSK9 increases
  the expression of VEGF-A and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules, which leads to the migration
  of monocytes and macrophages, thereby boosting the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and causing endothelial dysfunction. Silencing PCSK9 may counteract these
  effects. (C). Bempedoic acid exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily by upregulating
  AMPK, which subsequently reduces the activation of MAPK pro-inflammatory pathways.
  Additionally, bempedoic acid may improve the inflammatory environment by decreasing
  the production of prostaglandin E2 through the inhibition of ACLY. Abbreviations:
