caption: 'Schematic representation of the activation of UPR signaling pathways during
  ER-stress, caused by TAA injections, in liver cells. TAA causes activation of IRE1α
  and PERK UPR pathways through increased expression of JNK1 and NRF-2, which are
  targets of the IRE1α and PERK kinases. Increased expression of PUMA and p53 leads
  to increased expression and translocation to mitochondria of the pro-apoptotic proteins
  BAK and BAX, which ultimately leads to apoptosome formation and activation of caspase-9
  and caspase-3. In turn, active caspase-12 also activates effector caspase-3 through
  activation of caspase-9, which forms the apoptosome. Thus, under conditions of prolonged
  ER-stress caused by long-term action of TAA, pro-apoptotic signaling pathways are
  activated. After So injections, liver cells still retain high levels of some pro-apoptotic
  genes: CASP-12, CASP-3, and JNK1, which may indicate a high risk of apoptosis in
  liver cells. After injections with SeNPs or SeSo nanoparticles, the adaptive UPR
  pathway is activated through the PERK signaling pathway. Thus, SeNPs and SeSo are
  able to neutralize the effects of ER-stress and lead to a high increase in the expression
  of mRNA of a number of pro-apoptotic genes caused by TAA injections'
