caption: Quercetin efficiently protective BREC was related to the TLR4 signaling pathway.
  BREC was treated with quercetin (80 µg/mL) and 1 µg/mL LPS in 6-well plates for
  6 h (1 × 106 cells/mL). The mRNA levels of TLR4, CD14, MD2, MYD88, IRF3, TLR2, IRAK1,
  and NF-κB genes in the LPS-treated inflammation in the rumen epithelial cells were
  assessed via qRT-PCR. Means with different letters (a–d) differed significantly
  according to treatment group
