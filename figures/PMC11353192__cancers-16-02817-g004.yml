caption: Lactate and LOX mediated the expression of HCAR1 and its associated RAS and
  PI3K pathway proteins in BCa cells differently than in normal mammary epithelial
  cells. (A) Lactate stimulated and LOX abrogated the expression of HCAR1 and its
  associated RAS and PI3K pathway proteins as well as the activation of the pathways.
  (B) Lactate and LOX treatment only unambiguously affected KRAS expression but not
  the activation of the RAS and PI3K pathways in MCF10A cells
