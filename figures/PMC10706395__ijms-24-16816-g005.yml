caption: A model explaining the increased number of nodules found in MtCLE35 knock-out
  plants in comparison to wild-type plants under high-nitrate conditions. The dotted
  line indicates an indirect effect. In the absence of nitrate (left panels), legumeâ€“rhizobia
  interaction results in the formation of symbiotic nodules. Rhizobia induce a signaling
  cascade leading to the activation of key regulators of symbiosis. Among them, the
  expression of the NIN gene is induced, which encodes a key transcription factor
  regulating both rhizobia infection and nodule primordium development. The NIN transcription
  factor activates the expression of the CLE genes in response to rhizobia inoculation,
  including MtCLE12, MtCLE13 and MtCLE35. As a result, the AON system is activated
  by root-to-shoot transported MtCLE peptides, activating the MtSUNN receptor kinase,
  which operates in the phloem cells of leaves. In turn, a shoot-derived signaling
  pathway is induced to inhibit nodulation via a negative feedback mechanism. Knock-out
  of the MtCLE35 gene does not significantly reduce the induction of AON since MtCLE35
  acts redundantly with MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 to inhibit nodulation, and, therefore,
  the nodule number is not significantly increased in MtCLE35 knock-out plants. The
  presence of nitrate (left panels) downregulates symbiotic nodulation. One of the
  known mechanisms of such inhibition is mediated by the nitrate-activated NLP1 transcription
  factor, which has been suggested to inhibit nodulation by interfering with the NIN
  action. As a result, the expression levels of NIN-target genes, including MtCLE12
  and MtCLE13, are decreased. However, the expression of the MtCLE35 gene is not significantly
  reduced in developing nodules under high-nitrate conditions since the nitrate-activated
  NLP1 transcription factor is able to induce MtCLE35 expression. Therefore, in the
  presence of nitrate, MtCLE35 acts as the key inductor of AON since the expression
  levels of two other MtCLE genes, MtCLE12 and MtCLE13, are significantly decreased.
  Thereby, knock-out of the MtCLE35 gene results in a significantly increased nodule
  number in the presence of nitrate
