  are upregulated in EO771 Parp7KO cells.
caption: 'Levels of unphosphorylated interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) are
  upregulated in EO771 Parp7KO cells. (A) EO771 WT and Parp7KO cells have intact STING
  regulated type I IFN signaling pathway. The expression and/or phosphorylation of
  cGAS, STING, TBK1 and IRF3 are similar between WT and Parp7KO cells. However, Parp7KO
  cells have increased levels of unphosphorylated signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT2, and interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). Cells
  were treated with 10 µg/mL of DMXAA (+/− 100 nM RBN-2397) for 0, 2, 6, or 24 h,
  and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. (B) Levels of native
  STAT1 are higher in the EO771 Parp7KO cells independent of DMXAA treatment. (C)
  Levels of phosphorylated STAT1 after DMXAA treatment relative to native STAT1 are
  lower in the EO771 Parp7KO cells compared with both WT and RBN-2397-treated WT cells.
  (D) EO771 Parp7KO cells have increased cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of STAT1,
  STAT2, and IRF9 in both untreated and treated samples. (E) Stat1, (F) Stat2, and
  (G) Irf9 mRNA levels are higher in EO771 Parp7KO cells and after 24 h RBN-2397 treatment
  in WT cells. (H) Expression levels of P-ISGF3 target genes Myd88 is not significantly
  affected by PARP7 loss, while target genes (I) Adar and (J) Irf1 are slightly higher
  in the EO771 Parp7KO cells. (G) Expression levels of U-ISGF3 target genes, (K) Isg15
  and (L) Mx1, and (M) ISG15-induced gene Usp18 are all significantly higher in EO771
  Parp7KO cells and RBN-2397-treated WT cells. Cells were treated with 10 µg/mL of
  DMXAA (+/− 100 nM RBN-2397) for 6 h, and mRNA levels were quantified with RT-qPCR.
  * Denotes statistical significance (p < 0.05) compared to no treatment (E–G) or
  DMSO (H–M); # denotes statistical significance due to the loss of PARP7. Original
  western blots have been presented in File S1'
