figure_title: Nuclear YAP contributes to drug resistance of human cancer cells.
caption: Nuclear YAP contributes to drug resistance of human cancer cells. (A) Major
  organs and associated common cancers in the human body. Non-small cell lung cancer
  (NSCLC) is bolded to highlight this review’s unique focus on YAP in lung adenocarcinomas
  and non-small cell lung cancer [12,21]. (B) Lung cancer cells with high cytoplasmic
  (low nuclear) YAP are drug-sensitive. EGFR-TKIs, RAF inhibitors, and MEK inhibitors
  target mutated EGFR, RAF or MEK proteins, respectively. This causes loss of anti-apoptotic
  and pro-proliferative downstream effects, resulting in drug-induced cell death.
  Cisplatin and radiation directly target cancer cell DNA, inducing cell death. (C)
  Lung cancer cells with high nuclear (low cytoplasmic) YAP are often drug-resistant.
  YAP in the nucleus will bind to TEAD transcription factors to promote transcription
  of genes which produce anti-apoptotic/pro-proliferative/senescence-inducing proteins
  and pathways. These downstream mechanisms lead to drug resistance, anti-apoptosis,
  and senescence. New research shows that several Hippo-independent pathways can regulate
  YAP activity (Figure 3). First, biophysical stimulus, such as tissue stiffness,
  regulates the nuclear translocation of YAP and serves as an “on/off” switch of the
  Hippo pathway to regulate YAP in parallel [22]. The mechanism of this mechanically
  regulated YAP dynamics will be explained in detail in Section 2. Second, a few biochemical
  signals can regulate YAP, independent of the Hippo pathway, through focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK) [23,24,25] and Aurora A kinase [26]. However, FAK activity is downstream
  of cells’ integrin-mediated sensing of biophysical signals [27,28,29,30,31]; therefore,
  whether the FAK-YAP pathway is part of the mechano-regulated YAP pathway is currently
  under active investigation. T-bar arrows indicate drug-induced inhibition; black
  arrows indicate pathway activation, stimulation or promotion; and a red ‘X’ over
  an arrow denotes pathway loss. Created with Biorender.com
