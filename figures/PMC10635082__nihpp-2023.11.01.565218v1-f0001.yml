figure_title: MCPyV-perturbed cell model reveals signaling pathways perturbed during
  MCC development
caption: IMR90 normal human fibroblasts expressing inducible MCPyV early region (ER)
  was subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing. (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) was
  performed on 13870 expressed genes in the time series RNA-seq data. (B) The eigengenes
  of the 14 WGCNA modules were projected onto each time point and the modules were
  grouped by their dynamic patterns using hierarchical clustering. (C) Force-directed
  network of hub genes in the 14 WGCNA modules. The attraction forces between nodes
  were defined by the topological overlap matrix and were inversely proportional to
  the length of edges in the graph. (D) GO term enrichment analysis of each WGCNA
  gene module. The terms are ranked by adjusted p-value, and the top-ranked terms
  are shown
