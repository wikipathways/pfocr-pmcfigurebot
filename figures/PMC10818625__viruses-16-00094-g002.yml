caption: Pharmacological interventions against necroptosis in pneumonia. Cell necroptosis
  can be modulated by different drugs. Chemically synthesized drugs Necrostatin-1
  (Nec-1), SZM-1209, HG-9-91-01, Cis-sulfonatequinacrine (CIS) and Necrosulfonamide
  (NSA) can inhibit RIPK1 or RIPK3 or MLKL in the necroptosis signaling pathway, thereby
  preventing cell necroptosis. A variety of natural products also have the effect
  of inhibiting cell necroptosis. Acteoside (AC) inhibits cell necroptosis by preventing
  the release of TNF-α. Ursolicacid (UA) can not only inhibit the production of TNFR
  at the transcriptional level, but also prevent the release of TNF-α, exerting a
  necroptosis inhibitory effect. Crocetin and apigenin inhibit cell necroptosis by
  inhibiting the transcription of TNFR and TNF-α respectively. 6E11 selectively inhibits
  RIPK1 thereby blocking the necroptosis pathway activated by TRAIL or TNF-α. Aloperine
  (Alo) inhibits cell necroptosis by reducing TLR4 levels and blocking the TRIF/RIPK3/MLKL
  signaling pathway
