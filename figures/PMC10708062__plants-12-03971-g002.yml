  and roots after osmotic stress.
caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of the up- and down-regulated DEGs in leaves and
  roots after osmotic stress. (a) The enriched KEGG pathways of the up-regulated DEGs
  in leaves shared at 2 h and 50 h after osmotic stress. (b) The enriched KEGG pathways
  of the down-regulated DEGs in leaves shared at 2 h and 50 h after osmotic stress.
  (c) The enriched KEGG pathways of the up-regulated DEGs in roots shared at 2 h and
  50 h after osmotic stress. (d) The enriched KEGG pathways of the down-regulated
  DEGs in roots shared at 2 h and 50 h after osmotic stress. The q-value is represented
  by colors from blue to red. The size of the dark dots reflects the number of DEGs
  involved in each metabolism pathway
