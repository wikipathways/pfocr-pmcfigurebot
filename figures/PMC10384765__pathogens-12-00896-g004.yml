caption: HCA of relevant biological pathways differentially expressed due to infection
  by rNJ0612NME6 (WT) or rNJ0612NME6-M51R (mutant). Differential levels of expressions
  within genes associated with the identified biological/cellular pathways are represented
  (Aâ€“E). Values are expressed in terms of fold change (FC) Log2. The spectrum of colors
  ranges from green to red and reflect down- and up-regulation, respectively
