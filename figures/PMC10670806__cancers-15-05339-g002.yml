caption: NF2/Merlin signaling in a normal meningeal cell vs. Merlin-deficient meningioma
  cell. Merlin is an effective inhibitor of major signaling pathways that lead to
  cell proliferation, protein synthesis, and angiogenesis. In a normal meningeal arachnoid
  cap cell, the NF2 gene encodes for Merlin. Merlin is a cytoskeletal protein that
  interacts and complexes with integrin 3, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and β-catenin
  to inhibit mTOR signaling pathway, MAPK pathway, and WNT pathway, among others.
  Merlin inhibits downstream effectors of these pathways including RAS, PI3K, AKT,
  mTOR, and β-catenin. Additionally, Merlin interferes with the translocation of β-catenin
  into the nucleus, inhibiting canonical WNT signaling. Merlin also inhibits transcription
  factors YAP/TAZ and TEA by interacting with components of the Hippo pathway. Loss
  of Merlin function to NF2 mutations, such as in meningiomas, activates these pathways
  (indicated by arrows) and leads to cell proliferation, protein synthesis, and angiogenesis,
  contributing to meningioma incidence and progression
