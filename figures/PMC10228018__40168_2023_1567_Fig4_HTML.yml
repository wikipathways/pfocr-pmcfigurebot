caption: A. muciniphila downregulated inflammatory pathways and proinflammatory cytokine
  expression in the blood. a Pathway enrichment analysis using RNA sequencing indicated
  genes that were downregulated in the blood of aged mice treated with A. muciniphila
  compared with those in the blood of control mice. b Expression heatmap of the top
  DGEs in the NOD-like receptor signalling pathway from the blood of aged mice treated
  with A. muciniphila compared with those in the control group. c–e Quantitative reverse-transcription
  polymerase chain reaction results validated that the relative mRNA expression levels
  of IL-6, Trp53, and Hmg proteins were significantly decreased in the A. muciniphila-treated
  group. f Effect of A. muciniphila on plasma cytokine proteins of aged mice as detected
  by a cytokine antibody array (n = 5–6). Colours on the heatmap indicate relative
  cytokine levels. Red indicates upregulated cytokines, and blue indicates downregulated
  cytokines. g An ELISA verified that the key proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly
  decreased after A. muciniphila treatment. Ctrl, control; AKK, A. muciniphila. The
  overall significance between the two groups was determined by Student’s t-test.
