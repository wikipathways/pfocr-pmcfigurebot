caption: The activity of NF-kB p65/PD-L1 pathway in CRC cells treated with either
  IFN-γ, AT-II, or HLY78 alone or in combination. (A) Western blot analysis of p-NF-kB
  p65, NF-kB p65, and PD-L1 in HT29 and HCT15 cells treated with IFN-γ, AT-II or combination.
  (B) Western blot analysis of p-NF-kB p65, NF-kB p65, and PD-L1 levels in HT29 and
  HCT15 cells treated with combinations of IFN-γ, AT-II, and HLY78. Results were presented
  as mean ± SD. ▲P<0.05, ▲▲P<0.01, vs. Control group. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, vs. IFN-γ+AT-II
  group.
article_title: Atractylenolide II combined with Interferon-γ synergistically ameliorates
  colorectal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro by blocking the NF-kB p65/PD-L1
  pathway.
