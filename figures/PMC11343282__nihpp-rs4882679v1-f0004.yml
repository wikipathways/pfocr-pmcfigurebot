figure_title: Loss of BMP expression and abnormal epithelial proliferation in the
  Foxl1-deficient fetal small intestine
caption: (A) Model for partitioning of small intestinal epithelial cells into postmitotic
  villus cells and proliferating intervillus cells through BMP signals emanating from
  villus cluster cells.(B) Expression of multiple Bmpgenes is reduced in telocyte
  progenitor 1 cells in absence of Foxl1.(C) Determination of BMP signaling pathway
  activation by immunofluorescence staining for phosphorylated Smad1/5 (p-Smad1/5),
  downstream mediators of BMP receptor activation, in the fetal gut (E15.5). In control
  mice, p-Smad1/5 is detected in both villus tip epithelial cells as well as mesenchymal
  cells. In the Foxl1 null gut, p-Smad1/5 is dramatically reduced in both populations,
  indicating reduced BMP signaling.(D) Expression of the Wnt target gene Sox9(purple)
  is restricted to intervillus regions in the E15.5 control small intestine, but maintained
  in a subset of villus epithelial cells in Foxllnull mice. Likewise, proliferating
  epithelial cells, marked by Ki67 (purple) become restricted to intervillus regions
  in control mice, but extend over the emerging villus tip in absence of Foxl1. Epithelial
  cells are marked by E-cadherin (green).(E) Model for BMP signaling defect in the
  Foxl1 null small intestine. While in control fetuses, BMPs produced by Foxl1-positive
  telocyte progenitors activate SMAD1/5 in the villus tip epithelium as well as in
  mesenchymal cells, this pathway is interrupted in the absence of Foxl1. Loss of
  BMP signaling leads to over-proliferation of villus tip epithelial cells
