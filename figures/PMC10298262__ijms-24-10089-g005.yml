  levels.
caption: DEG and enzyme activity analysis of carbon metabolism at different nitrogen
  levels. (A) DEG distribution of the CAZyme genes at A1 vs. A2 and A2 vs. A3. UP
  represents the upregulated genes, DOWN represents the downregulated genes and NO
  represents the genes with no difference in expression. (B) Venn diagrams comparing
  shared DEGs between A1 vs. A2 and A2 vs. A3. A heatmap of the 36 overlapping genes
  in the Venn diagram was generated. (C) The gene expression profiles of the starch
  and sucrose metabolic pathways in A1, A2 and A3. (D–G) The activities of β-GA, Cx,
  β-GC and ACX were detected under three nitrogen levels. All data are presented as
  the means ± SDs of three independent experiments. Bars with different letters are
  significantly different at p < 0.05 according to Duncan’s multiple range test
