figure_title: Causes of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment.
caption: Causes of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. This illustrates the
  mechanisms leading to tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. There are four main
  parts, each of which lists what cytokines or pathways ultimately cause immunosuppression.
  TAMs, tumor-associated macrophages; ECM, extracellular matrix; PD-L1, programmed
  death-ligand 1; MDSCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells; Tregs, regulatory T cells;
  TANs, tumor-associated neutrophils; CTLs, cytotoxic T lymphocytes
