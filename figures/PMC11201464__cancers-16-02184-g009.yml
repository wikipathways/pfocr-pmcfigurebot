caption: Heatmaps of differentially expressed genes in the Notch signaling pathway.
  Expression of 23 genes relating to ligands, regulators, and downstream effectors
  of the Notch signaling pathway after exposure to the combination of MK-0752, gemcitabine,
  and docetaxel at the IC30 for 72 h relative to DMSO vehicle control was compared
  in (A) SK-UT-1B and (B) SK-LMS-1 cells
