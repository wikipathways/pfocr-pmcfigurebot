figure_title: DRD2-mediated signaling pathway downregulation by domperidone.
caption: DRD2-mediated signaling pathway downregulation by domperidone. HCT116 cells
  were treated with domperidone (0, 5, 25, and 50 μM) for 24 h. (A) Immunoblot analysis
  of the dopamine receptors DRD1 through DRD5. (B) Co-immunoprecipitation of β-arrestin
  2 and MEK. (C) Immunoblot analysis of β-arrestin 2 and MEK
