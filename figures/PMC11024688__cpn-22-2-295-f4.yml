caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway of the PI3K-AKT (A,
  B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (C, D) signaling pathway was mapped
  by fold changes. The red and green colors indicate hypermethylation in tic disorder
  patients and healthy controls, respectively. Left and right each signaling pathway
  was mapped in male (A, C) and female (B, D) analysis, respectively
