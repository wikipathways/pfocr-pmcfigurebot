caption: A schematic model for spreading inflammation. ATP induced by activation of
  the IL-6 amplifier in Col1a+ non-immune cells in one side of the ankle joint (left
  side) activates Nav1.8+TRPV1± sensory neurons, which stimulate the regional sensory
  neural pathway involving the lower thoracic spinal cord that contains proenkephalin+
  interneurons. On the contralateral side (right side), the response of sensory neurons
  in L4–L6 DRGs releases ATP, which induces inflammatory mediators, including cytokines
  and chemokines, by activating the IL-6 amplifier in Col1a+ non-immune cells, including
  fibroblasts and endothelial cells, through P2RX7.
article_title: ATP spreads inflammation to other limbs through crosstalk between sensory
  neurons and interneurons.
