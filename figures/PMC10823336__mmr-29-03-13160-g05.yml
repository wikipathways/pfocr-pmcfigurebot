  responses.
caption: Titanium particle treatment induces NOD-like receptors to exert proinflammatory
  responses. (A) Titanium particle treatment induced the activation of the MAPK and
  NF-κB signaling pathways. (B) Titanium particle treatment induced the activation
  of the NOD-like receptor pathway, while Mettl3 overexpression attenuated these effects.
  (C) Titanium particle treatment and Mettl3 knockdown enhanced the mRNA stabilities
  of NOD1 and RIPK2 following the addition of actinomycin D. (D) Titanium particle
  treatment and Mettl3 knockdown decreased the m6A modification of NOD1 and RIPK2.
  The control group in this figure were osteoblasts without transfection. Data are
  representative of three independent experiments and are presented as the mean ±
  standard deviation. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001. Ctrl, control;
  Lv, lentivirus; m6A, N6-methyladenosine; Mettl3, methyltransferase-like 3; NOD,
  nucleotide binding oligomerization domain; ns, not significant; p-, phosphorylated;
  RIPK2, receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2; sh, short hairpin RNA; Ti,
  titanium particle
