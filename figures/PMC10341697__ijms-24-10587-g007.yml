caption: Dynamic molecular mechanism portrait of the anthocyanin synthesis pathway
  illustrating the color formation of Tibetan hulless barley seed coats. The red line
  represents the higher PCG expression level at the soft dough stage in purple Nierumuzha
  relative to white Kunlun 10. The blue line represents a much lower level of expression.
  Both cis- and trans-regulated lncRNAs that are consistent with the expression pattern
  of their target PCGs are written in red font, and those that are not consistent
  with the expression pattern of their target PCGs are written in blue
