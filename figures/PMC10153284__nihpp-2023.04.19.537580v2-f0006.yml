figure_title: Panx1 promotes memory CD8+ T cell maintenance through eATP export and
  activation of the AMPK pathway
caption: (a-b) WT (CD4-Cre) or P2RX7-KO (CD4-Cre P2rx7fl/fl) P14 cells (CD45.2+) were
  in vitro activated for 24h, then were electroporated with the Cas9 protein combined
  with sgRNAs for Cd4 (sgCd4; control) or Panx1 (sgPanx1; Panx1-KO). After 48h of
  resting with IL-2, P14 cells were transferred into recipient mice (CD45.1+) infected
  with LCMV-Arm. (a) Experimental design. (b) Numbers of total spleen P14 cells (left),
  spleen TCM P14 cells (middle) and spleen LLEC P14 cells (right) at day 42 post-infection.
  (c) CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl P14 cells were transferred into C57BL/6 mice
  infected with LCMV-Arm. At day 7 post-infection, MP P14 cells were sorted. OCR kinetics
  (left), average baseline OCR values (middle) and average SRC OCR values (right)
  are shown. (d-h) CD4-Cre or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro
  (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) for 72h, then further polarized into memory-like cells with
  IL-15 for additional 72h. (d) Experimental design. (e) In the left, OCR kinetics
  for both groups are shown. In the right, average baseline OCR values, average SRC
  OCR values, and average ECAR/OCR ratios are shown. (f) OCR kinetics (left) and average
  baseline OCR values (right) are shown for memory-like cells with additional treatment
  with eATP +/− A-438079. (g) Average TMRE gMFI values for memory-like cells with
  additional treatment with eATP +/− A438079. (h) OCR kinetics (left) and average
  TMRE gMFI values for memory-like cells with additional treatment with sodium lactate.
  (i) CD4-Cre or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl mice were infected with LCMV-Arm and analyzed
  at 60 days post-infection. Histograms showing pACC staining (top) and average pACC
  gMFI values (bottom) are shown for memory gp33+ CD8+ T cells. (j) Heatmap showing
  expression of genes from the AMPK and FOXO1 pathways in memory-like CD8+ T cells;
  expression in CD8+ T cells (with 72h post-activation) are shown in comparison. (k-l)
  CD4-Cre (WT; CD45.1/2+) or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl (Panx1-KO; CD45.2+) P14 cells were
  transferred into WT (CD45.1+) mice infected with LCMV-Arm; between days 1–7 post-infection,
  mice were treated with AICAR. (k) pACC expression in P14 cells. (l) Panx1-KO/WT
  P14 cell ratios for spleen total (top) and TCM (bottom) cells are shown. (m-n) CD4-Cre
  or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2)
  then polarized into memory-like cells, with additional treatment with vehicle or
  AICAR. (m) pACC expression in CD8+ T cells. (n) Average TMRE gMFI values (left),
  OCR kinetics (middle), and average baseline OCR values (right) are shown. (b-c,
  e-i, k-n) Data from 2–3 independent experiments, n=4–13. (j) Data from 2–3 biological
  replicates per experimental group (from n=5–8 mice per group). ns – not significant
  (p>0.05), *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001, One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  post-test (b, f-i, m-n), Unpaired t-test (c, e, k-l)
