caption: Joint pathway diagram of HupA biosynthesis and antioxidant mechanism in H.
  serrata. Pattern (A) represents the HupA biosynthesis, Pattern (B) represents the
  flavonoid biosynthesis, Pattern (C) represents the phenylalanine metabolism, and
  Pattern (D) represents the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. The circle represents the
  metabolites in the pathway (red indicates up-regulation; green indicates down-regulation).
  The rectangles represent the regulatory genes in the pathway (red indicates up-regulation;
  green indicates down-regulation).
article_title: Combined transcriptome and widely targeted metabolome analysis reveals
  the potential mechanism of HupA biosynthesis and antioxidant activity in Huperzia
  serrata .
