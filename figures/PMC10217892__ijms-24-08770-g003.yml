caption: Schematic representation of the main step in the anthocyanin biosynthetic
  pathway (A). Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavonol 3-hydrogenase
  (F3H), flavonol 3′-hydrogenase (F3′H), flavonol 3′5 ′-hydrogenase (F3′5′H), dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), and UDP-glucose:anthocianidin:flavonoid
  glucosyltransferase (UFGT). Relative expression levels of OePAL, Oe4CL, OeCHS, OeCHI,
  OeF3H, OeF3′H, OeF3′5′H, OeDFR, OeANS, and OeUFGT genes (B–U) in ‘Carolea’ (orange
  scales) and ‘Tondina’ (green scales) drupes harvested at 130, 150, 165, and 180
  days after flowering (DAF) from plants grown at different meters above sea level
  (masl). The results were reported as mean value (±standard deviation) of three replicas.
  Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with the Tukey post hoc
  test (p < 0.05) after the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Different letters denote
  significant differences between ripening stage and growing area
