caption: (A) Summary of retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway. (B) Summary of RA signaling
  pathway following toluene exposure. In general, RA is metabolized by retinaldehyde
  dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) and plays a role in neuronal differentiation, development,
  and plasticity. However, toluene exposure downregulates RALDH2 (ALDH1A2) expression
  owing to methylation, which hinders RA metabolism and activation; this, in turn,
  may negatively impact neuronal differentiation, development, and plasticity. Figure
