caption: The workflow of this study. ScRNA reads were aligned to ‘hg38 reference genome’
  and ‘repeatmasker tracks’ using STAR and sc–TE aligners to count both genes and
  TEs. In the next step, count matrixes were filtered, batch effects were removed,
  and all matrixes were integrated. Then, TEs were removed temporarily from the integrated
  matrix. After PCA and clustering, TEs were added, and DE analysis was conducted
  between all clusters. Finally, the correlation between DE TEs and some pathways
  was investigated. This figure was created by BioRender
