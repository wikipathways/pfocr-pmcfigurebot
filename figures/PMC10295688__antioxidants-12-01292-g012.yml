  cancer cells.
caption: Timeline of the antitumor signaling pathway activated by MG in colon cancer
  cells. MG exposure triggered autophagy and apoptotic cell demise. The represented
  processes are orchestrated by an intertwined liaison between oxidative injury and
  p53. The early generation of ROS, accompanied with intracellular calcium increase
  and ER stress, stimulated p53 to switch the autophagy toward apoptotic cell death
