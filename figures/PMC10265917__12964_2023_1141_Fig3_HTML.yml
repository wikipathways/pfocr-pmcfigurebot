caption: Regulation of SINGR3 expression by L. acidophilus. Salivary glands were harvested
  from the vehicle and L. acidophilus groups. A Representative images of SINGR3-positive
  cells in salivary glands and average numbers of SINGR3-positive cells. B Representative
  images of IL-10-positive cells in salivary glands and average numbers of IL-10-positive
  cells. C HSG cells were stimulated with TNF-α (2 ng/mL) and IL-17 (20 ng/mL) in
  the absence or presence of L. acidophilus (10 or 100 µg/mL) for 48 h and harvested
  for mRNA extraction and real-time PCR. Bar graphs show mRNA levels of SINGR3 (top
  and left), PD-L1 (top and right), IDO (bottom and left), and IL-10 (bottom and right).
  D Mouse non-T cells from the spleen were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL) in the
  absence or presence of L. acidophilus (10 or 100 µg/mL) for 48 h and harvested for
  mRNA extraction and real-time PCR. mRNA levels of SINGR3 (top and left), PD-L1 (top
  and right), IDO (bottom and left), and IL-10 (bottom and right) are shown. E Representative
  images of STIM1 in the salivary gland and average numbers of STIM1-positive cells.
  F Representative images of phosphor-STING in the salivary gland and average numbers
  of phosphor-STING-positive cells. G Splenocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 (0.5 µg/mL)
  in the absence or presence of L. acidophilus (10 or 100 µg/mL) for 48 h and harvested
  for flow cytometry. FACS plots show percentages of type I IFN–producing dendritic
  cells. H Bar graphs show average percentages of type I IFN–positive cells. Data
  are means ± SD (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001)
