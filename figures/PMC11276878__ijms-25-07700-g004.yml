figure_title: Identification of factors and pathways involved in sulfur metabolism
  and sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism.
caption: 'Identification of factors and pathways involved in sulfur metabolism and
  sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism. (A) Venn diagram of DEPs selected from
  GO terms and KEGG pathways associated with sulfur metabolism and sulfur-containing
  amino acid metabolism. (B) Volcano plot shows the distribution of 79 gene expression
  levels screened from (A). (C) Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction
  for the 79 proteins identified in panel (A). Orange nodes represent proteins interacting
  with both CTH and CBS, while green nodes represent proteins interacting with either
  CTH or CBS. Red nodes denote the key enzymes for H2S synthesis, CTH and CBS. (D)
  Heatmap showing the clustering of 16 significantly differentially expressed proteins
  from 79 proteins. (E) Sankey diagram illustrating the relationship between DEPs
  and three pathways and 16 biological processes related to sulfur metabolism and
  sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism. Red font highlights key enzymes involved
  in H2S synthesis, including CTH and CBS. Statistical analyses: Wilcoxon rank sum
  test, α = 0.05. Data are presented as median (rank). * Represents p < 0.05'
