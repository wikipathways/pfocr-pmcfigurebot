caption: ASF1 complex-associated pathways. (A) Potential implication of ASF1A in GM-CSF-dependent
  inflammatory pathway. ASF1A inhibits the over-expression of GM-CSF. ASF1A depletion
  (dashed box) blocks (red cross) the inhibition pathway, which leads to the over-expression
  of GM-CSF, establishing an anti-tumor immunogenic response [32]. (B) The potential
  implication of ASF1A in Wnt signaling pathway is to cause the over-expression of
  Î²-catenin, which stimulates oncogene transcription [40]
