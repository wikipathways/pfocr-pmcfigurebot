figure_title: Genome-wide Screen Identifies Purine and Pyrimidine Synthesis Pathways
  as Essential for viability in MLL3/4-KO mESCs
caption: (A) Flowchart showing CRISPR KO-based dropout screening in WT and KO cells.
  (B) GO biological process pathway analysis (using MAGeCK) of the top 300 negatively
  selected genes in MLL3/4-KO cells. (C) Rank plot showing the distribution of negative
  RRA score with the scores of the 12 genes involved in purine/pyrimidine synthesis
  that were identified as essential in MLL3/4 KO. (D) Î² scores of gene essentiality
  were calculated for WT and KO cells. The 12 screen-identified genes involved in
  purine/pyrimidine synthesis are shown in the 9-square view. Orange, genes selectively
  essential in KO not WT; light purple, genes selectively essential in WT not KO;
  green, genes depletion of which enhanced survival in KO not WT; dark purple, genes
  depletion of which enhanced survival in WT not KO. (E) Distribution of sgRNA read
  counts (normalized) of the 2 representative genes Ppat and Mthfd1 in WT and KO cells
  at different time points. The four colors represent the four distinct sgRNAs in
  the Brie CRISPR library
