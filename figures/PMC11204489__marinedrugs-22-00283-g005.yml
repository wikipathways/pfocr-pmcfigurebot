figure_title: ISE inhibited the αVβ3-FAK/Src signaling pathway in vWF-stimulated HUVECs.
caption: 'ISE inhibited the αVβ3-FAK/Src signaling pathway in vWF-stimulated HUVECs.
  (A–C) Western blotting analysis of integrin β3 and integrin αv expressions in HUVECs
  pretreated with LPS and different concentrations of ISE. n = 5 independent experiments.
  *** p < 0.001 vs. the vehicle group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001 vs.
  the LPS group. (D) Evaluation of endothelial permeability in vWF-stimulated HUVECs
  using the FITC-dextran assay. ns p > 0.05, *** p < 0.001 vs. the vehicle group.
  (E–G) Western blotting analysis of VE-cadherin and occludin expression in HUVECs
  pre-incubated with vehicle or different concentration of vWF. ns p > 0.05, *** p
  < 0.001 vs. the vehicle group. (H) The IC50 value of ISE for the increased endothelial
  permeability induced by 100 ng/mL vWF is 37.5 μM. (I–K) VE-cadherin and occludin
  expression in vWF-stimulated HUVECs following pretreatment with ISE or cilengitide
  alone or ISE + cilengitide. ns p > 0.05, *** p < 0.001. (L) Evaluation of endothelial
  permeability using the FITC-dextran assay. ns p > 0.05, *** p < 0.001. (M–O) Western
  blotting analysis of total and phosphorylated FAK (Y397) and Src (Try416) expressions
  in vWF-stimulated HUVECs pretreated with different concentrations of ISE. n = 5
  independent experiments. *** p < 0.001 vs. the vehicle group; ### p < 0.001 vs.
