  on NMDA-evoked [3H]-NA release from rat cortical brain slices.
caption: Intracellular signalling pathway of adenosine A2A receptors on the modulation
  on NMDA-evoked [3H]-NA release from rat cortical brain slices. The slices were stimulated
  for two periods (S1-S2), 45 min apart, with 30 µM NMDA for 2 min. The selective
  A2A agonist CGS 21680 were added to the superfusion medium 10 min before S2 and
  kept until the end of the stimulation period. The inhibitors of PKA H-89, of the
  PLC U-73122 and its inactive analogue U-73343, the inhibitor of PKC Ro 32-0432 and
  the CAMKII KN-93 were added to the superfusion medium 20 min before S2 and kept
  until the end of the experiment (+) signs under each column indicates the combination
  of drugs used in the respective experimental conditions. The effect of drugs is
  expressed as % inhibition of NMDA-evoked [3H]-NA. Values are mean ± SD from six
  experiments. * p < 0.05, significant different from control (solvent); + p < 0.05,
  significant different from the effect of CG 21680 alone
