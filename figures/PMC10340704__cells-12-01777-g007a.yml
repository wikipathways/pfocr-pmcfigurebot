  alleviation of EMT and G2/M arrest in vitro.
caption: 'AKT/mTOR-signaling-pathway-mediated autophagy is required for the ASIV-induced
  alleviation of EMT and G2/M arrest in vitro. (a) Protein expressions of p-mTOR,
  t-mTOR, p-ULK1, t-ULK1, ATG7, SQSTM1, Beclin1, and LC3 I/II in HK-2 cells using
  Western blotting. (b) Quantitative analysis of the phosphorylation levels of mTOR
  and ULK1 and the relative protein expressions of ATG7, SQSTM1, Beclin1, and LC3
  II/LC3 I. (c) Protein expressions of fibronectin, vimentin, and α-SMA in HK-2 cells
  using Western blotting. (d) Quantitative analysis of the relative protein expressions
  of fibronectin, vimentin, and α-SMA. (e) Protein expression of p-p53ser15, p53,
  p21, and p-H3ser10 in HK-2 cells using Western blotting. (f) Quantitative analysis
  of the phosphorylation level of p53 and the relative protein expressions of p21
  and p-H3ser10. Representative images of immunofluorescence staining for (g) fibronectin,
  (h) F-actin, (i) Ki67 (red)/p-H3 (green), and (j) LC3 I/II in the HK-2 cells. Data
  are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3, 100 µm scale bar). One-way ANOVA was followed
  by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. ### p < 0.001 vs. the control group; * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. the TGF-β1 group; ^ p < 0.05, ^^ p < 0.01,
  ^^^ p < 0.001 vs. the TGF-β1 + ASIV group'
