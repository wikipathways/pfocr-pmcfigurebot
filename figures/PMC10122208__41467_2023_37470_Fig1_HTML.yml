figure_title: Intranasal infection with rhinovirus induced inflammasome-mediated immune
  responses in the epithelium of lower airways in asthma
caption: 'a Overview of the experimental in vivo RV-A16 infection in humans. b Top
  significantly enriched pathways within genes changed after in vivo RV-A16 infection
  in bronchial brushings from patients with asthma compared to genes changed in control
  individuals (control n = 7, asthma n = 17). Black line represents a ratio of genes
  in the experiment over the whole pathway set. c Volcano plots of all (black), significant
  (red), and significant inflammasome-mediated immune response (blue) genes in bronchial
  brushings from controls (upper panel) and patients with asthma (lower panel) after
  in vivo RV-A16 infection (control n = 7, asthma n = 17). d Heatmap of genes encoding
  inflammasome-mediated immune responses after in vivo RV-A16 infection in controls
  (left panel) and patients with asthma (right panel) presented together with the
  corresponding log2 fold change (FC) expression changes (black bars) (control n = 7,
  asthma n = 17). Yellow and grey left-side color bars represent genes upregulated
  and downregulated, respectively. e–f Representative confocal images of pro-IL-1β
  in bronchial biopsies at baseline and after in vivo RV-A16 infection, scale bars:
  20 μm. Quantification based on the MFI x103: 10 equal epithelial areas from each
  biopsy (demonstrated as circles, squares, triangles, or diamonds) of control subjects
  (n = 3, before; n = 3, after) and patients with asthma (n = 3, before; n = 4, after).
  g–h Secretion of IL-1β to BAL fluid before and after in vivo RV-A16 infection in
  (g) controls (n = 9) and (h) patients with asthma (n = 19, before; n = 18, after).
  Data are presented as arbitrary units (arb. units). i, j Representative confocal
  images of caspase-1 in bronchial biopsies at baseline and after in vivo RV-A16 infection,
  scale bars: 20 μm. Quantification based on the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
  x103: 10 equal epithelial areas from each biopsy (demonstrated as circles, squares,
  triangles, or diamonds) of control subjects (n = 3) and patients with asthma (n = 3,
  before; n = 4, after). Patients with asthma are presented in red, control individuals
  are presented in blue. (n) indicates the number of biologically independent samples
  examined from one in vivo RV-A16 infection. Heatmap displays normalized gene expression
  across the groups (row normalization). Transcriptome data analyzed with Bioconductor
  microarray analysis workflow [https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/arrays/inst/doc/arrays.html],
  raw p-value presented. Asterisks represent statistical significance, p-value: *<0.05;
  **<0.005; ***<0.0005, ****<0.00005. Bar graph data present mean ± SEM analyzed with
  one-way ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis test), RM one-way ANOVA (Friedman test), mixed-effects
  model with post-hoc analysis as appropriate, or paired two-tailed T-test or Wilcoxon
  test, as appropriate, depending on the data relation and distribution. Source data
  are provided as Source Data files. Arb. units arbitrary units; BAL Bronchoalveolar
  lavage, MFI mean fluorescence intensity, RV-A16 rhinovirus A16.'
