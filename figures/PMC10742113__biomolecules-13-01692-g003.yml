caption: Signaling pathway mediated by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides (LPSs).
  At the plasma membrane of target cells, LPS binds to TLR4 that recruits MyD88, facilitating
  the activation of IRAK and TRAF6. Subsequently, these proteins initiate the activation
  of MAPK and NF-κB pathways, involving JNK and IKK, respectively. This culminates
  in the activation of AP-1 and NF-κB transcription factors which leads to the production
  of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. In the adipose tissue, LPS alters
  the production of specific adipokines and alters lipid metabolism, thereby inciting
  insulin resistance. Indeed, TLR activation abrogates the insulin signaling cascade
  through activation of kinases like JNK that promote serine phosphorylation of IRS-1
  and disruption of the PI3K/Akt/AS160 pathway responsible for GLUT4 translocation
  to the plasma membrane, and thus glucose uptake. In parallel, in endothelial cells,
  LPS promotes the production of adhesion molecules, causing macrophage infiltration
