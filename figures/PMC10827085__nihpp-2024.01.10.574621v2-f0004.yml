figure_title: Proteomics confirms GLUT1 absence in CD34+ GLUT1-KO derived reticulocytes
  and Metabolite analyses reveals downregulated metabolic processes
caption: A Simplified schematic of multi-omics cell preparation, where CD34+ from
  3 donors were nucleofected with either GLUT1- or non-targeting gRNAs, expanded and
  differentiated into reticulocytes. 10 million filtered reticulocytes were needed
  for comprehensive analyses of the proteome, metabolome, and lipidome. Made using
  BioRender. B Box plot comparing GLUT1 protein level between NT and GLUT1 KO reticulocytes
  as Log2(Fold change). Box plot analysis (mean±min to max with standard deviation)
  was performed by RStudio, and significance was calculated upon false discovery rate
  correction (***p < 0.001).C,D Hierarchical clustering of the Top 50 t-test significant
  proteins (C) and metabolites (D) between NT and GLUT1 KO CD34+-derived reticulocytes.
  E Schematic representation of Glycolysis, the Polyol pathway, and the Glutathione
  redox cycle where proteins and metabolites are colour-coded by Log2 (Fold Change)
  of GLUT1-KO reticulocytes in relation to NT control. The 10 steps of glycolysis
  are represented, with glucose and lactate both reduced in the KO while the remaining
  intermediate products increased. All involved enzymes are decreased (HK, Hexokinase;
  GPI, Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; PFK1, Phosphofructokinase-1; TPI1, Triosephosphate
  isomerase; GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BPGM, Biphosphoglycerate
  mutase; PGK, Phosphoglycerate kinase; PGAM, Phosphoglycerate mutase; PK, Pyruvate
  kinase; LDHA, Lactate dehydrogenase A). There is an imbalance in the Glutathione
  cycle, as a consequence of increased ROS, characterised by the depletion of the
  reduced form (GSH) and increase of oxidised glutathione (GSSG) and glutathione peroxidase
  1 (GPX1). The Hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt is upregulated as source of NADPH,
  needed to maintain glutathione in its reduced form. (G6PD, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  PGLS, 6-phosphogluconolactonase; GSR, Glutathione-disulfide reductase). An increase
  in polyols (such as sorbitol and mannitol) was also detected, which can be converted
  into Fructose-1,6-phosphate by sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) and ketohexokinase
  (KHK). Created with Biorender.
