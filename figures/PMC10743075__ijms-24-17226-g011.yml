caption: Supplementation of n-3-PUFAs also led to a significant decrease in the mRNA
  expression of genes of the steroid biosynthetic pathway. KEGG pathway map of steroid
  biosynthesis. mRNA expression of squalene monooxygenase [EC:1.14.14.17], sterol-4α-carboxylate
  3-dehydrogenase [EC:1.1.1.170], delta24-sterol reductase [EC:1.3.1.72], and 7-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase [EC:1.3.1.21] was significantly decreased by n-3-PUFA administration;
