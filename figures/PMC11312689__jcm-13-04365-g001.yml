caption: Schema of infection and neopterin (NP) and total biopterin (BP) biosynthetic
  pathway. NP is produced by activated monocytes and macrophages (MΦ) after the conversion
  of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (NH2TP) via
  GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH). GCH mRNA expression is induced by IFN-γ released from
  activated Th1s and other cells. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is produced from NH2TP
  via several enzymatic reactions, including 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase
  (PTPS). BH4 is then oxidized to dihydrobiopterin (BH2), and the final oxidation
  product is biopterin (BP). IFN-γ, interferon-γ; Th1, helper T lymphocyte
