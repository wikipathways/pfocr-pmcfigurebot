caption: The cell functions of K6, K16, and K17. Damaged keratinocytes release various
  DAMPs, which induce the expression of K6/16/17 by activating the AP-1, NFkB, Nrf2,
  MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38) pathways. Altered expression of K17 promotes the secretion
  of Th1 cytokines (IFNγ, IL17A, and IL22) that maintain K6/16/17 expression through
  an autoimmune feedback loop. Keratin 17 regulates cell growth and proliferation
  by binding to the 14-3-3σ/AKT/mTOR pathway and STAT3 phosphorylation. When located
  in the nucleus, keratin 17 is involved in the DNA damage response by interacting
  with various DNA damage response proteins, including Aire, hnRNPK, H2AX, DNA-PKcs,
  53BP1, and HMGN2. Keratin 16 modulates the secretion of DAMPs through the MAPK and
  EGFR signaling pathways and plays a role in maintaining the redox balance by interacting
  with the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Keratins K6 and K16 also play a role in regulating
  the morphology and functions of mitochondria. Keratin 6 is involved in regulating
  cell adhesion by directly interacting with myosin IIA and desmosomal proteins, which
  provide the mechanical properties necessary for wound healing
