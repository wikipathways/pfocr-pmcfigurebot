figure_title: GO functional annotation of DEGs.
caption: GO functional annotation of DEGs. GO enrichment analysis of the 37 most significantly
  enriched terms of the shared DEGs in the GSE78000 dataset. The x-axis indicates
  -lg10 (P-value), and the y-axis indicates the 37 most significantly enriched GO
  pathways. The number in brackets represent number of genes and enrichment factor,
  respectively. Blue bars represent ‘biological processes’, orange bars represent
  ‘molecular functions’ and green bars represents ‘cellular components’. GO, Gene
  Ontology; DEGs, differentially expressed genes
