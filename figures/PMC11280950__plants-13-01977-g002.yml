figure_title: The canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway in Arabidopsis.
caption: The canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway in Arabidopsis. RNA Polymerase
  IV (POL IV) interacts with the CLASSY protein (CLSY1) and SAWADEE homeodomain homolog
  1 (SHH1), which is bound to dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2). POL IV generates
  single-stranded RNA precursors, and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2) produces
  double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). DICER-LIKE PROTEIN 3 (DCL3) cleaves the dsRNA into
  24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The siRNAs bind to ARGONAUTE proteins
  (AGO4 and AGO6). The AGO-sRNA duplex binds to complementary sequences along an RNA
  scaffold produced by RNA Polymerase V (Pol V). This reaction is assisted by RDM3,
  the DDR complex, and SUVH2/9. RDM3 is a putative transcription elongation factor
  of Pol V. The DDR complex consists of DRD1, DMS3, and RDM1. SUVH2/9 interacts with
  pre-existing methylated DNA. Domains Rearranged Methyltransferase 2 (DRM2), recruited
  by AGO-sRNA duplex, catalyzes de novo methylation in nearby DNA
