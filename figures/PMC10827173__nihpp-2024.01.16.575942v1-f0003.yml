figure_title: Lupus gut microbiota and dietary tryptophan contribute to distinct fecal
  metabolite profiles
caption: '(A) PCA plots of metabolite features identified by positive and negative
  ionization. (B) Metabolic pathway analysis of metabolites with significantly differing
  intensity between tryptophan-high and tryptophan-low groups in B6 mice receiving
  TC microbiota (TC2B6) or B6 microbiota (B62B6). The pathways unique to each group
  are labeled with red font (C) Metabolites specifically enriched in TC2B6 or B62B6
  mice (overlapping metabolites were not plotted). Left panel: metabolites differentially
  enriched by tryptophan in TC2B6 mice but not B62B6 mice. Right panel: metabolites
  differentially enriched by tryptophan in B62B6 mice but not TC2B6 mice. SCFAs are
  labeled with red font'
