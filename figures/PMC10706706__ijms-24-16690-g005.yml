figure_title: Regulation of GSL biosynthesis by MYB and MYC transcription factors
  of beet armyworm larvae defense responses.
caption: Regulation of GSL biosynthesis by MYB and MYC transcription factors of beet
  armyworm larvae defense responses. (A) When unstimulated, the JAZ inhibitor binds
  to the JID domain of the MYC transcription factor and thus inhibits MYC/MYB interaction.
  (B) When a plant is attacked by insects and activates the JA pathway, the JAZ suppressor
  is removed from the JID domain, thereby enhancing the interaction between MYBs and
  MYCs and thus enhancing the expression of genes related to the GSL biosynthesis
  pathway. (C) Heatmap showing the expression patterns of MYC and MYB DEGs after beet
  armyworm larvae chewing. Expression data are plotted as log2FC. The framework of
  the pathway is adapted from ref. [25]
