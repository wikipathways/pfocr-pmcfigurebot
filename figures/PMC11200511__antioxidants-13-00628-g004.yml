caption: SVHRSP exerts inhibitory effects on neuroinflammation in SAMP8 mice by modulating
  the MAPKs/NF-κB signaling pathway. (A–D) Representative Western blot bands and quantitative
  analysis of cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 and nuclear NF-κB p65. (E–H) Representative Western
  blot bands and quantification analysis of p-JNK, JNK, p-P38, and P38. (I–K) Quantitative
  analysis of the serum level of IL-1B, IL-6, and TNF-α measured by using ELISA. (L–N)
  Quantitative analysis of the mRNA level of IL-1B, IL-6, and TNF-α measured by using
  QRT-PCR. (O) Representative immunohistochemical images of Iba-1 (left) and GFAP
  (right). (P,Q) Representative image and quantitative analysis of Nissl staining.
  The bars represent the mean ± SD. ns = not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 versus the indicated groups. Scale bar = 50 μm (n
  = 3 for each group)
