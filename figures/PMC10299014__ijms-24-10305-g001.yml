caption: IL-17RA/RC signalling pathways (Figure adapted from Monin and Gaffen [3],
  and from Chung [4]). Homotypic interactions between the SEF/IL-17R (SEFIR) domains
  of the receptor and the adaptor Act1/CIKS are made possible by ligand (IL-17A/IL-17F/IL-17A/F)
  binding to the receptor complex. The nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) route, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein b (C/EBPb), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are
  all activated by the conventional IL-17 signalling pathway, which is started by
  Act1-induced K63 linked ubiquitination of TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6).
  Downstream target genes, such as those encoding proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines,
  and antimicrobial peptides, are then transcriptionally activated as a result. In
  contrast, noncanonical signalling relies on Act1 phosphorylation at amino acid 311,
  leading to recruitment of the RNA-binding protein HuR and formation of the TRAF2/TRAF5
  complex, which sequesters the alternative splicing factor ASF/SF2 (mRNA-destabilizing)
