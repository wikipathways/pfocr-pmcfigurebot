caption: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Vpp
  infection. (A) β-catenin expression in Spike Vpp-infected cells. 293T cells were
  infected with Spike or VSV-G Vpp at MOI 0.5 for 2 and 24 hpi. Cellular lysates were
  subjected to Western blot analysis using mouse anti-β-catenin and rabbit anti-GAPDH
  antibodies. The ratio of the band intensities was calculated using ImageJ. (B) β-catenin
  activity in Spike Vpp-infected cells. HEK293T-ACE2 cells were transfected with TOPFlash
  or FOPflash reporters together with pTK-Rluc normalization vector. At 24 hpt, the
  cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2-Spike GFP Vpp for 24 h. Firefly luciferase activities
  were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities and are shown as fold change relative
  to mock-infected cells. (C) Validation of Wnt3a-conditioned media (CM). H1650-ACE2
  cells were pre-treated for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of the control
  or Wnt3a-CM and were harvested for Western blot analysis. (D) Spike Vpp infection
  in Wnt3a-CM-treated cells. H1650 cells were incubated with control or Wnt3a-CM for
  24 h and subsequently infected with Spike Vpp for 24 h. Luciferase activities are
  shown as fold change in Wnt3a-CM-treated cells relative to control CM-treated cells.
