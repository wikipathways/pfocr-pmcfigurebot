figure_title: LncRNA MALAT1 negatively regulates miR-206 expression in HCC.
caption: 'LncRNA MALAT1 negatively regulates miR-206 expression in HCC. (A) Expression
  of MALAT1 in HCC and matched tumor-adjacent tissues (n=50). (B) A negative correlation
  was identified between MALAT1 and miR-206 in a cohort with 50 patients with HCC.
  (C) The expression of MALAT1 in HCC cell lines MHCC97-H, HCCLM3, Huh-7 and Hep3B;
  MIHA used as NC. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  **P<0.01 vs. MIHA. (D) Schematic representation of the predicted binding site for
  miR-206 and lncRNA MALAT1. (E) Relative luciferase activity of MALAT1 wt or mut
  in 293T cells following transfection with the miR-206 mimics, inhibitor or corresponding
  NC. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. **P<0.01;
  ##P<0.01. (F) lncRNA MALAT1 expression levels following transfection with miR-206
  mimic or miR-206 inhibitor were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
  **P<0.01; ##P<0.01. (G) Verification of successful downregulation of MALAT1 by siRNA
  and overexpression of MALAT1 by pcDNA-MALAT1 vector transfections in MHCC97-H and
  Huh-7 cells. **P<0.01; ##P<0.01. (H) MALAT1 knockdown increased, whereas overexpression
  of MALAT1 decreased miR-206 expression in HCCLM3 and Huh-7 cells. **P<0.01; ##P<0.01.
  (I) lncRNA MALAT1 increases c-Met expression via sequestering miR-206 at post-transcription
  level, leading to the activation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, thus promotes HCC
  cell growth, migration and invasion. HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; hsa, Homo sapiens;
  lncRNA, long non-coding RNA; miR, microRNA; NC, negative control'
