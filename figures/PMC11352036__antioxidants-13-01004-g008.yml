  signaling pathway.
caption: 'Sodium selenite induces autophagy and apoptosis in vivo via the AMPK/mTOR/FOXO3a
  signaling pathway. (A) Protein expression levels of LC3-II, p62, cleaved-caspase3,
  and cleaved-PARP in tumors from different intervention groups; the expression of
  β-actin was used as a reference. (B,C) Immunofluorescence analysis of cleaved-caspase3
  and LC3B in tumor sections, magnification ×200. (D) Expression levels and quantitative
  analysis of p-AMPK, p-mTOR, and FOXO3a in tumors from different intervention groups;
  the expression of β-actin was used as a reference. (E) Immunohistochemical analysis
  of FOXO3a in tumor sections, magnification ×400. (F) Evaluation of changes in the
  ADP/ATP ratio in tumors. All results were repeated at least five times. * indicates
  statistical significance compared to the control group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. Con: Control; SS: sodium selenite; c-PARP: cleaved-PARP;
  c-caspase3: cleaved-caspase3'
