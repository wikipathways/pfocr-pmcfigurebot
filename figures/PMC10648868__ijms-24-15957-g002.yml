  of IL−1β.
caption: Reciprocal effects of p38 and ERK MAPK signaling pathways for the expression
  of IL−1β. (A,B) Cells were pre-treated with either 10 μM of chemical inhibitors
  (BAY11-7082, SB203580, PD98059, SP600125; (A)) or 20 μM of chemical inhibitors (SB203580,
  PD98059; (B)) for 1 h, followed by treatment with 1 μg/mL of DnaJ for 4 h. (C–E)
  Cells were transfected with 50 nM of either ERK1 siRNA or ERK2 siRNA. Forty-eight
  hours post-transfection, the transfected cells were treated with 1 μg/mL of DnaJ
  for 4 h (C). The effect of siRNA was verified by qPCR analysis (D,E). (F) Cells
  were treated with 1 μg/mL of DnaJ for the indicated time. (G–I) Cells were pre-treated
  with 10 μM of chemical inhibitors (SB203580 and PD98059 for (G,I); BAY11-7082 for
  (H) for 1 h, followed by treatment with 1 μg/mL of DnaJ for the indicated time.
  After treatment, the increase in IL−1β mRNA level was quantified by qPCR analysis,
  and the levels of protein were measured by either ELISA or immunoblot analysis.
  Data in (A–E) are expressed as means ± SD (n = 3). Data in (F–I) are representative
  of three separate experiments. ***, p < 0.001 vs. DnaJ treatment alone (A–C), or
  no transfection (D–E)
