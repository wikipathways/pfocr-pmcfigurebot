caption: Summary of the TGFβ family induced signalling in EVT. During placentation,
  the coordinated migration and invasion of EVTs is critical for the maintenance of
  a successful pregnancy. During the first trimester, CTs undergo an EMT-like process
  and differentiate into EVTs. These EVTs migrate and invade the decidua and maternal
  spiral arteries in the myometrium. Highly regulated interactions between EVTs and
  surrounding cells, including NK cells, macrophages (M0), and stromal cells, play
  an important role in the immunological acceptance and depth of trophoblast invasion.
  In a normal pregnancy (A), TGFβ signalling regulates the process of trophoblast
  invasion. Different ligands, such as BMPs, activins, and GDFs, are involved in promoting
  EVT invasion and migration. For example, BMP2 can directly or indirectly activate
  different receptors (ALK2, ALK3, or ALK4), subsequently inducing Smad1/5/8 or Smad2/3
  activation, depending on the context of signalling and receptor binding. Activin
  A binds to ALK4 and activates Smad2/3, leading to the activation of metalloproteinase
  2 (MMP2). GDF8 and GDF11 also activate Smad2/3 and downstream MMP2. To maintain
  a balance in trophoblast invasion, the secretion of inhibitors or molecules that
  attenuate their activity regulates the activity of trophoblast proteases. TGFβ and
  Nodal subfamilies are involved in the induction of TIMPs, with TGFΒs signalling
  through ALK5 and Nodals signalling through ALK7. In PE (B), trophoblasts fail to
  invade the spiral arteries adequately, resulting in reduced blood flow and impaired
  utero-placental perfusion. The impaired invasion appears to be the first change
  on cellular level that contributes to the pathogenesis of PE. TGFβ1 inhibits cell
  invasion through ALK5 and Smad2/3 induction, and contributes to the upregulation
  of miR142-3p and Snail expression in PE. Non-canonical ERK1/2 signalling may also
  be involved in inhibiting invasion by inducing Kiss-1 expression. Interestingly,
  elevated levels of Activin A in PE trigger apoptosis via the Nodal/ALK7 pathway
  rather than by inducing MMP expression. Elevated levels of Nodal, on the other hand,
  do not inhibit EVT migration but rather induce apoptosis via the ALK7 pathway. M0,
  macrophages.
