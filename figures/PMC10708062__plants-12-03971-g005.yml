caption: Analysis of DEGs involved in polyamine biosynthesis and metabolism under
  osmotic stress. The color spectrum ranging from yellow to red represents log2FC
  values from low to high, |Log2FC| â‰¥ 1. The dashed lines represent source, the dashed
  boxes represent pathway, the solid lines represent synthesis
