caption: RTN3 suppression promotes M2 macrophage polarization in a manner dependent
  on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. A, B. KEGG enrichment analysis of the differential
  genes induced by RTN3 knockdown contrast to Vector NC or QGP-1-H-exos contrast to
  QGP-1-N-exos. C. Western blot results for the expression of proteins in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway in macrophages treated with PBS, QGP-1-N-exos, QGP-1-H-exos or
  exosomes from QGP-1 cells treated with GW4869 under hypoxia. D. Expression of proteins
  in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in macrophages transfected with mimics NC,
  miR-4488 mimics, H-exos or both H-exos and miR-4488 inhibitor were measured by western
  blot. E. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway related genes expression in macrophages
  transfected with NC Vector, RTN3 knockdown plasmid, miR-4488 mimics or both miR-4488
  mimics and RTN3 overexpression plasmid were measured by western blot. F. Western
  blot was performed to detect the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway related genes expression
  in macrophages transfected with NC Vector, FABP5 knockdown, RTN3 knockdown, or both
  FABP5 knockdown and RTN3 overexpression plasmids
