caption: 'Limiting the number of Mets promotes the recovery of motor function and
  nerve conduction. (a) BBB scores of the Sham, SCI, and DNase I groups at 0, 7, 14,
  21, and 28 days after the operation, respectively. Data are exhibited as Mean ±
  SD (n = 6).  ∗P < 0.05 vs. Sham group; #P < 0.05 vs. SCI group (one-way analysis
  of variance followed by the least significant difference test). SCI: spinal cord
  injury; BBB scale: Basso-Beattie-Breshman Locomotor Rating Scale. (b) Inclined plane
  test results of the three groups at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the operation,
  respectively. Data are displayed as Mean ± SD (n = 6).  ∗P < 0.05 vs. Sham group;
  #P < 0.05 vs. SCI group. (c) Footprint map of three groups. (d–f) Representative
  bar graphs of rotation angle, the base of support, and stride length, respectively.
  Compared with those in the SCI group, the rotation angle and stride length in DNase
  I group were significantly improved. Data are shown as Mean ± SD (n = 6).  ∗P <
  0.05 vs. Sham group; #P < 0.05 vs. SCI group. (g) The waveform of MEP in Sham, SCI,
  and DNase I groups. Horizontal lines indicate the positions of peaks and troughs.
  The vertical lines split the periods of waves. (h–i) Typical bar graphs of MEP amplitude
  and latency in three groups, respectively. (h) The MEP amplitude in DNase I group
  is larger than the SCI group and similar to the Sham group. (i) The MEP latency
  in DNase I group is shorter than the SCI group and similar to the Sham group. Data
  are presented as Mean ± SD (n = 6).  ∗P < 0.05 vs. Sham group; #P < 0.05 vs. SCI
  group. MEP: motor evoked potentials.'
