caption: Fecal metabolomic changes and metabolic pathway in patients with AONFH. (A)
  The gut metabolites were identified by HMDB superclass analysis. (B) Volcano plot
  demonstrated the number of dysregulated metabolites in the feces of patients with
  AONFH compared with the NC group. (C) Computed metabolic pathways as a function
  of P-value and the pathway impacts of the key metabolites that were differentially
  expressed between the AONFH and NC groups. AONFH, alcohol-induced osteonecrosis
  of the femoral head; NC, negative control; HMDB, Human Metabolome Database
