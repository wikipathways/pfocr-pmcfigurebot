caption: TORC1 pathway manipulations alter underlying stable MT signal. (A) Heat map
  showing percent change from control in acetylated α-tubulin and Futsch levels for
  each genetic manipulation. Each experimental condition was compared to WT control
  and appropriate statistical comparisons were performed (detailed in ). See  for
  representative images. (B) Representative reconstructions of branches from WT and
  TORC1 genetic manipulations—normalized mCherry::Jupiter fluorescence is coded with
  the rainbow spectrum shown (A.U.). Scaled axes are provided in µm. (C) Heat map
  representing the average normalized, binned mCherry::Jupiter fluorescence along
  dendrites at increasing distances from the soma for each genotype. TORC1 inhibitions
  are marked in purple and TORC1 activations in green. Genotypes found to be significantly
  different along the dendritic arbor are marked with an asterisk. In all panels *
  = p < 0.05, see  for detailed statistics.
