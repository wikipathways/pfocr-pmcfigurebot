figure_title: NRP-1 gene expression generating axis of stem-cell properties.
caption: NRP-1 gene expression generating axis of stem-cell properties. (A) NRP-1
  was involved in the Wnt/β-catenin-signaling-dependent CSC generation and the Nanog
  and Oct-3/4 signaling pathway mechanisms, endowing cells with biological properties
  resembling those of ESCs (ES-like property), such as self-renewal, pluripotency
  and the reversibility of cellular states, which are hallmarks of ESCs. (B) RNA binding
  protein, Lin28B, is involved in the control of let-7 and miRNA stability, which
  plays a role in controlling cell differentiation and cell stemness. NRP, neuropilin;
  CSCs, cancer stem cells; ESC, embryonic stem cells; miR/miRNA, microRNA; UTR, untranslated
  region; let-7, let-7 microRNA; TUT4, Terminal uridylyltransferase 4; ZCCHC11, zinc-finger,
  CCHC domain-containing protein 11; Lin28B, Lin-28 homolog B
