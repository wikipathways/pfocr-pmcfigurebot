caption: Highly activated biological processes found in MSI-High cell lines stratified
  by their p53 genotype Highly activated pathways were clustered into 41 biological
  processes of which 26 were highly activated in both MSI-High p53 Mut and WT; 4 processes
  are unique to MSI-High p53-WT and 11 to MSI-High p53-Mut
