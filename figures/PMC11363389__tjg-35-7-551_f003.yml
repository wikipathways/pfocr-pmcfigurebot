caption: HNK inhibited MAFLD progression by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
  (A) The oil red stain was utilized to evaluate the fat levels in LO2 cells, the
  MAFLD model, MAFLD model treated with HNK, RIPK3 inhibitor, Nrf2 inhibitor + RIPK3
  inhibitor, respectively. Bar = 100 μm. (B) CCK-8 assay was used to measure the cell
  survival rate of LO2 cells with different treatments. n = 8, *P < .05 was shown
  as significance between the 2 groups. Student’s t-test was used to compare differences
  between the 2 groups
