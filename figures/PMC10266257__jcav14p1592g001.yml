caption: Resistance of thyroid cancer to vemurafenib is associated with upregulation
  of RTK receptors and ligands. A Vemurafenib IC50 detection by CCK-8 assay in BCPAP,
  K-1, 8305C, BHT-101, and KTC-1 cell lines. B Western blot analysis revealed reactivation
  of the ERK signaling pathway in 5 BRAF mutant thyroid cancer cell lines after 48
  h of vemurafenib (5 μM) treatment. C Heat map analysis of RT-qPCR results showed
  activation of multiple RTK receptors and ligands in 5 BRAF mutant thyroid cancer
  cell lines (BCPAP, K-1, 8305C, BHT-101, and KTC-1) after 48 h of vemurafenib treatment
  (5 μM)
