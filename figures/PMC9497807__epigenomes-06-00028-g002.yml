caption: PRC2 composition and normal mechanism of recruitment. Scheme of PRC2 subunits
  in mammals and drosophila melanogaster, including the core and accessory subunits
  of PRC2 complex in mammals. (A) Subunits of PRC2.1 and PRC 2.2 protein complex in
  mammals. The core PRC2.1 contains PCL1/2/3 and the PALI1/2 or EPOP subunits. The
  binding between the core PRC2, JARID2 and AEBP2 constitutes PRC2.2. (B) The original
  pathway of PcG recruitment, first discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, has two
  sequential steps (represented in blue). First, PRC2 is recruited to the chromatin
  areas with Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) and deposits the repressive H3K27me3
  mark via EZH1/2. This mark is recognized by canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) and RING1A/B
  deposits the ubiquitination on H2AK119. In addition, in mammals (represented in
  black), PRC2 recruitment occurs at CGIs, via transcription factors, lncRNAs, or
  an alternative recruitment pathway, in which non-canonical PRC1 (ncPRC1) complexes
  are recruited in a KDM2B-dependent manner, which deposits the H2AK119 ubiquitination
  mark recognized by the JARID2 and PCL1/2/3 subunits of PRC2.2 and PRC2.1, respectively.
