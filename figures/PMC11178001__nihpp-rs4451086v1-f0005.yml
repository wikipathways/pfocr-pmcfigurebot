caption: Cell populations (cluster 5, articular chondrocytes) that are underrepresented
  in the mutant growth plates. A) Violin plots showing the expression of top genes
  in cluster 5, Creb5 and Wif1; B) Immunofluorescence for Creb5 protein â€“ its expression
  was detected in articular chondrocytes in the control growth plate (white arrows)
  while in the mutant, Creb5 expression is almost absent; C) GSEA of cluster 5 showing
  upregulated (shown in red) and downregulated (shown in blue) pathways. D) GSEA plot
  showing that in this cluster 5, biological process of non-canonical WNT signaling
  pathway is downregulated

  chondrocytes reveal distinct cell populations responsible for longitudinal growth
  and enchondroma formation
