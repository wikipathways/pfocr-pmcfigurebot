  fibroblast-myofibroblast transition in TAO OFs.
caption: 'The serelaxin and Notch signaling pathways negatively regulate the TGF-β1-induced
  fibroblast-myofibroblast transition in TAO OFs. (A) Serelaxin weakened the inhibitory
  effect of the Notch signaling pathway induced by TGF-β1. (B,C) The protein level
  of NICD and Jagged-1 was quantified and analyzed. (D) Serelaxin inhibited TGF-β1/smad2
  pathway. (E) The protein level of p-smad2. (F) Western blotting analysis of NICD
  and α-SMA expression in the absence or presence of DAPT and serelaxin. (G,H) The
  protein level of NICD and α-SMA was quantified and analyzed with or without DAPT
  and serelaxin (n = 3). * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.001 compared with
  the control; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01 and #### p < 0.0001 compared with TGF-β1; &
  p < 0.05 and && p < 0.01 represent TGF-β1 with serelaxin compared to TGF-β1 with
  serelaxin and DAPT'
