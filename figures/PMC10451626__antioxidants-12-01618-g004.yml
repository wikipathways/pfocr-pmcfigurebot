caption: Effects of salt stress on metabolic intermediates of the common and chlorophyll
  branches in the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway in leaves of rice seedlings. (A)
  Chlorophyll. (B) ALA-synthesizing capacity. (C) Proto IX and Mg-porphyrin intermediates.
  Data are means ± SE of nine replicates obtained from three independent experiments.
  Mean values followed by different lowercase letters are significantly different
