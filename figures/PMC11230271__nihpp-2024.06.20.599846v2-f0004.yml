figure_title: Global metabolomic and lipidomic profiling revealed metabolic dysregulation
  and disruptions in lipid classes with age in liver tissues
caption: '(A) Metabolomics heatmap showing the relative abundance of metabolites.
  (B-M) Metabolite pools illustrating the metabolic pathways that are altered with
  age in the liver– Vitamin A Metabolism, TCA Cycle, Nucleotide Metabolism, and NAD+
  metabolism. (N) Heatmap showing enriched lipid classes based on comparison between
  young and old liver tissues. (O) Volcano plot labeling significant hits, which have
  adjusted p-value <0.05 and fold change (+ or −) greater than 1. For each tissue
  and metabolite in the heatmaps, the aged samples were normalized to the median of
  the young samples and then log2 transformed. Significantly different lipid classes
  represented in the figures are those with adjusted p-values < 0.05 (note: p-values
  were adjusted to correct for multiple comparisons using an FDR procedure) and log
  fold changes greater than 1 or less than −1. Young, n= 4; aged, n= 4. For all panels,
  error bars indicate SEM, ** indicates p< 0.01; and *p< 0.05, calculated with Student’s
  t-test'
