figure_title: Protein interaction network created using STRING database based on Bos
  taurus genome.
caption: 'Protein interaction network created using STRING database based on Bos taurus
  genome. Edges represent protein–protein associations, line thickness indicates the
  strength of the supporting data, network nodes represent proteins, and colors indicate
  their functional categories: GO database—dark blue—GO:0032481 “Positive regulation
  of type I interferon production” (FDR = 9.69 × 10−13); green—GO:0002764 “Immune
  response-regulating signaling pathway” (FDR = 9.76 × 10−12); grey—GO:1901222 “Regulation
  of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling” (FDR = 3.33 × 10−6); KEEG-pathways—light blue—bta04620
  “Toll-like receptor signaling pathway” (FDR = 1.53 × 10−32); pink—bta04621 “NOD-like
  receptor signaling pathway” (FDR = 3.48 × 10−16); yellow—bta04060 “Cytokine–cytokine
  receptor interaction (FDR = 8.74 × 10−9); light green—bta04612 “Antigen processing
  and presentation (FDR = 0.0187)'
