figure_title: TAM receptors and their downstream signaling pathways in osteoblasts.
caption: 'TAM receptors and their downstream signaling pathways in osteoblasts. AXL
  induces osteoblast proliferation and survival via activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway
  and inhibition of caspase signaling but inhibits osteoblast mineralization. TYRO3
  inhibits RHOA signaling in osteoblasts, promoting cytoskeletal remodeling leading
  to enhanced differentiation and mineralization but reduced migration. MERTK induces
  RHOA-ROCK signaling in osteoblasts, which negatively regulates important osteoblastogenesis
  pathways WNT and IGF-1. Activation of MERTK negatively regulates differentiation
  and mineralization but promotes migration. Main pathways and biological functions
  induced by AXL are coloured in green, TYRO3 in turquoise and MERTK in brown. Arrows
  illustrate activation and blunt arrows silencing of indicated pathways. Boxes at
  the bottom highlight biological functions of AXL, TYRO3 and MERTK in osteoblasts.
  Arrow up: Increased function; Arrow down: Decreased function. IGF-1R: IGF-1 receptor;
  GDP: guanosine diphosphate; and GTP: guanosine triphosphate. Created with BioRender.com'
