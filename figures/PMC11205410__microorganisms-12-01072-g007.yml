  SHZ01. (A) GO Functional Classification Diagram: This diagram illustrates genes’
  Gene Ontology (GO) functional classification. The horizontal axis depicts the GO
  functional categories, the right vertical axis indicates the number of genes annotated
  for each category, and the left vertical axis represents the percentage of genes
  in each category relative to all coding genes. (B) KEGG Metabolic Pathway Classification
  Diagram: The bar chart displays the classification of genes into different metabolic
  pathways according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Numbers
  on the bars denote the count of genes annotated for each pathway. The other coordinate
  axis provides the code for each level 1 functional class in the KEGG database. (C)
  COG Functional Classification Diagram: This diagram represents the functional classification
  of genes based on the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) database. The horizontal
  axis indicates COG functional types, and the vertical axis shows the number of genes
  annotated for each type. (D) NR Functional Classification Diagram: In this diagram,
  the horizontal axis represents species ID, and the vertical axis indicates the number
  of genes annotated for each species in the Non-Redundant Protein Database (NR).
  (E) TCDB Function Classification Diagram: The horizontal axis represents the TCDB
  primary classification type, and the vertical axis represents the number of genes
  on the annotation. (F) CAZy Functional Classification and Corresponding Gene Quantity
  Statistical Chart: The horizontal axis represents the classification type of the
  CAZy database, from left to right—Auxiliary Activities (AAs); cCarbohydrate-Related
  Modules (CBMs); Carbohydrate Esterases (CEs); Glycoside Hydrolases (GHs); Glycosyl
  Transferases (GTs); Polysaccharide Lyases (PLs). The vertical axis represents the
  number of genes annotated. (G) Statistical Diagram of Gene Clusters and Corresponding
  Gene Numbers: The horizontal axis represents Gene cluster name, and the vertical
  axis represents the number of genes contained in gene clusters. (H) Distribution
  Map of Pathogen PHI Phenotypic Mutation Types: The horizontal axis represents the
  type of phenotype mutation, and the vertical axis represents the number of genes
  on the annotation'
