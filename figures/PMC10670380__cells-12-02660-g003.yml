caption: Multi-level functional integration of extended regions of the human genome,
  above and beyond individual noncoding RNAs. The NEAT1–MALAT1 genomic region encodes
  a biologically integrated circuit controlling innate immune sensing and cell–cell
  interactions. From an evolutionary perspective, the NEAT1–MALAT1 genomic region
  appears as a highly integrated RNA processing circuitry critically contributing
  to immune homeostasis. Its components MEN-β, MEN-ε, menRNA, MALAT1, TALAM1, and
  mascRNA are obviously set for well-balanced interactions with each other. Genetic
  ablation of any element therefore leads to major dysfunction. Beyond prior work
  in NEAT1 and MALAT1 knockout mice, a recent cell biological study identified menRNA
  and mascRNA as novel components of innate immunity with deep impact upon cytokine
  regulation, immune cell–endothelium interactions, angiogenesis, and macrophage formation
  and functions. These tRNA-like transcripts appear to be prototypes of a class of
  ncRNAs distinct from other small transcripts (miRNAs, siRNAs) by biosynthetic pathway
  (enzymatic excision from lncRNAs) and intracellular kinetics, suggesting a novel
  link for the apparent relevance of the NEAT1–MALAT1 cluster in cardiovascular and
  neoplastic diseases. For the long primary transcripts of NEAT1, a function of general
  cell-biological interest has been identified. They are critical for the formation
  of paraspeckles which are involved in multiple cellular functions, and possibly
  also in the broader context of micellization and the formation of biomolecular condensates
  essential for proper subcellular and nuclear compartmentalization. Obviously, molecules
  involved in these fundamental processes may deeply impact upon various cellular
  functions in a context-dependent manner, so that their observed association with
  diverse diseases is therefore not entirely unexpected. Overall, the NEAT1–MALAT1
  genomic region may serve as paradigm of a biological integrated circuit fine-tuning
  multiple cellular processes covering innate immune sensing and cell–cell interactions.
