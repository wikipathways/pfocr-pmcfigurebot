figure_title: AsC activates the ATF/CHOP signaling pathway.
caption: AsC activates the ATF/CHOP signaling pathway. (A) A549, LLC, A375 and B16F10
  cells were treated by AsC at indicated concentrations for different times (0, 3,
  6, 12, 24, 36 h). Levels of ATF4 and CHOP proteins were detected using Western blotting.
  (B) A549, LLC, A375 and B16F10 cells were treated with 10 μM AsC or oxaliplatin
  for 24 h. Levels of ATF4 and CHOP proteins were detected using Western blotting.
  (C) A549, LLC, A375 and B16F10 cells were treated with 10 μM AsC or oxaliplatin
  for 24 h, the images of ATF4 were detected by the immunofluorescence
