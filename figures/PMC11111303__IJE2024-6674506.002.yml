caption: Differential gene analysis before and 1 day (1 D) after MWA. 81 differential
  genes (a) enriched in oxygen transport-related signaling pathways (b), consistent
  with GO analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed hypoxia (c) and glycolysis-related
  (d) signaling pathways consistent with gene ontology (GO) analysis
