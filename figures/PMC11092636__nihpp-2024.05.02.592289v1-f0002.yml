figure_title: Exercise counteracts amyloid-dependent transcriptomic changes
caption: (a) Scatter plot of gene expression showing a negative correlation between
  exercise effects (APP_EX vs. APP_RT) and amyloid effects (APP_RT vs. WT_RT) across
  different cell types. (b) Heat map of 833 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  with the reversed pattern in at least one cell type. (c) Number of overlapping reversed
  DEGs across different cell types. (d) Overlapping pathways enriched in reversed
  DEGs across different cell types. (e-f) GSEA analysis of the insulin signaling pathway,
  a top common enriched pathway in reversed genes in different cell types
