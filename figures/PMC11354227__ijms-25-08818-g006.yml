caption: Top enriched signaling pathways in healthy volunteers treated with BIO 300
  Oral Powder. Top 25 canonical pathways identified using IPA that have a Fisherâ€™s
  exact test p < 0.05 and an absolute z-score > 2 in healthy volunteers treated with
  BIO 300 once daily at 3000 mg/day for six consecutive days. Whole blood was sampled
  at 12 h after the last dose for transcriptomic analyses and changes in gene expression
  were compared to whole blood sampled just prior to the first dose. Data were adapted
  from a previously published phase 1 clinical trial of healthy volunteers. Blue bars
  indicate predicted inhibition of the pathway and orange bars indicate predicted
  activation. The darker the shading of the bars, the higher the absolute z-score.
  The black symbols represent the ratio of enriched genes in the data set compared
  to the total number of genes associated with the pathway
