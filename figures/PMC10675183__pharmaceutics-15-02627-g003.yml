caption: 'Curcumin inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway and SHH expression, which
  are downstream of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in ADMSCs. (A,B) Relative pNF-κB translocation
  levels in nuclei of ADMSCs after treatment for 4 h were imaged via immunofluorescence
  staining and quantified. The protein levels of (C) pNF-κB, NF-κB, and (D) SHH were
  determined using Western blotting analysis. (E) The secretion level of SHH was quantified
  using ELISA kits. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared to the control
  group; # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001 compared to the CAF group; Con:
  control; CAF: MCF7-CM-treated group; AMD: MCF7-CM-treated group with 20 μM of AMD3100;
  Cur: MCF7-CM-treated group with 20 μM of curcumin; scale bar: 100 μm'
