caption: Purine metabolism is a potent metabolic checkpoint of T-cell hyperactivation-mediated
  liver injury. (A) Liver and plasma samples from ConA-induced mice and NC mice and
  plasma samples from AIH patients and healthy controls were collected for metabolomics.
  (B-C) The heatmap displays the top 20 up- and downregulated differentially abundant
  metabolites in mouse liver and plasma. (D-E) Pathway analyses based on the differentially
  abundant metabolites in mouse liver and plasma between the ConA and NC groups. (F)
  The heatmap displays the top 20 up- and downregulated differentially abundant metabolites
  in human plasma. (G) Pathway analyses based on the differentially abundant metabolites
  in human plasma between AIH patients and HCs. (H) The number of identical differentially
  abundant metabolites in liver and plasma samples from mice and humans. (I) The species
  of identical differentially abundant metabolites according to the three metabolomics
  analyses. (J) Pathway analyses based on the differentially abundant metabolites
  identified by the three metabolomics methods. (K) Pearson correlation coefficients
  (r) were calculated for the expression levels of purine nucleotides and clinical
  indicators. The numbers in the boxes are the r values. The depth of the color reflects
  the |r| value; red or blue indicates a positive or negative correlation, respectively.
