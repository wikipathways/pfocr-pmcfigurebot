caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms of VEGF (receptor) inhibitors-induced
  cardiovascular complications. Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway causes apoptosis to
  be activated and ROS to accumulate, which may harm mitochondrial function. Whereas,
  blocking off-target kinases such as AMPK is linked to disrupting energy homeostasis,
  decreased cell survival, and a reduced ability to respond to cardiac stress. Each
  element might have an impact on how HF develops. When it comes to artery thrombosis,
  the lowered level of PGI2 and NO encourages platelet aggregation, and the level
  of TXA2 is elevated, which predisposes an individual to ATEs. Furthermore, oxidative
  stress may result from reduced NO production. Additionally, compromised vascular
  integrity could root in antiangiogenesis and lead to thrombosis. To sum up, hypertension,
  cardiac dysfunction, and ATEs are brought on by VEGF (receptor) suppression. AMPK,
  adenosine 5â€²-monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ATE, arterial thromboembolic
  event; NO, nitric oxide; PGI2, prostacyclin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TKIs,
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors; TXA2, thromboxane A2; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
