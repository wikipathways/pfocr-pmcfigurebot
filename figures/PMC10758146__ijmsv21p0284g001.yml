figure_title: Lithium exerts neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke through multiple
  mechanisms.
caption: 'Lithium exerts neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke through multiple
  mechanisms. GSK-3: glycogen synthase kinase 3; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK: extracellular signal- regulated kinase;
  MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; NMDAR: N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; FoxO3a: forkhead
  box O3; NLRP3: nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and
  pyrin domain-containing protein 3; cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA: protein
  kinase A; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; AKT: protein kinase B; CREB: cAMP-response
  element binding protein; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Trk: tropomyosin-related
  kinase; PSD-95: postsynaptic density protein 95; GAP-43: growth associated protein-43;
  BBB: blood-brain barrier. Lines with solid arrows represent stimulatory connections;
  lines with flattened ends represent inhibitory connections. Dashed lines represent
  pathways with reduced activity as a result of lithium treatment'
