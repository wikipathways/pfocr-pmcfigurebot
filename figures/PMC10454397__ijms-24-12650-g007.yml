figure_title: Overexpression of BmJHBPd2 results in upregulation of the 20-hydroxyecdysone
  (20E) signaling pathway in silk glands assayed using qRT-PCR.
caption: 'Overexpression of BmJHBPd2 results in upregulation of the 20-hydroxyecdysone
  (20E) signaling pathway in silk glands assayed using qRT-PCR. The following 20E
  signaling pathway–related genes were selected: Brc (A), E74A (B), USP (C), EcR (D),
  HR3 (E), and E75A (F). BmRpl3 was used as a control. Results are expressed as means
  ± S.D. of three independent experiments. ** p < 0.01; ns, not significant'
