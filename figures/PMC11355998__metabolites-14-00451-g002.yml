caption: Metabolite pathway analysis. KEGG metabolite molecular network diagram of
  comparisons performed between sheep and pigs (A) and geese and chickens (B). Green
  dots represent metabolic pathways, and other dots represent metabolite molecules.
  The size of the metabolic pathway point indicates the number of metabolite molecules
  connected to it, with greater numbers represented by larger points. The metabolite
  molecular points indicate the size of the log2(FC) value through the gradient change
