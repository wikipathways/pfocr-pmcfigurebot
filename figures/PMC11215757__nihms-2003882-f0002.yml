figure_title: Production of hiPSC-CMs
caption: (A) Protocol for the differentiation timeline for making hiPSC-CMs from hiPSCs.
  This small molecule-mediated differentiation approach involves modulation of the
  Wnt signaling pathway to induce cardiac mesoderm and cardiomyocytes. Schematic made
  with BioRender. (B) Phase contrast image of hiPSC-CMs. (C) Immunofluorescence staining
  of hiPSC-CMs illustrates cardiomyocyte-specific protein markers anti-cardiac troponin
  T (cTnT) and anti-Î±-actinin, as well as the nucleus stained with DAPI.
