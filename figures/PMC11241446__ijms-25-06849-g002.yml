caption: Identification and biological characteristics of two molecular subtypes of
  colon cancer. (A) Consensus matrix of TCGA-COAD for k = 2. (B) CDF curves in consensus
  clustering analysis. CDF curves representing consensus scores for different subtype
  numbers (k = 2â€“9). (C) Survival curves of TCGA-COAD patients among different subtypes.
  Survival rate differences were evaluated using log-rank test, p < 0.05. (D) Heatmap
  of seven TAS2Rs prognostic genes in the TCGA-COAD dataset. (E) GSEA enrichment analysis
  showing the activation status of biological pathways in two molecular subtypes of
  colon cancer, red boxs indicates an important signaling pathway
