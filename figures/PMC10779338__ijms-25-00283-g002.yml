caption: 'TNF-α induces MMP-9 expression via TNF receptor-dependent pathway. (A,B)
  Cells were pretreated with a TNF receptor antagonist R-7050 (1 μM) following TNF-α
  (30 ng/mL) incubation for the indicated times. After the stimulation, the MMP-9
  expression and activity were analyzed by gelatin zymography, Western blot, and RT-PCR
  (GAPDH and β-actin as the internal controls). The intensity of the zymographic quantitated
  by densitometry and gene expression was expressed as fold of untreated control.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). * p < 0.05, # p < 0.05, as compared
  to untreated control and TNF-α treatment only, respectively. (C) After stimulation,
  the cells were fixed and labeled with anti-ZO-1 antibody and a FITC-conjugated secondary
  antibody, and then the cell images were observed by immunofluorescence stain (ZO-1).
