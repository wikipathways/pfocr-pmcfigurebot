caption: Screening using the RT2 Profiler PCR Array to determine the effect of PAC
  on genes involved in the DNA repair pathway. Scatter plots show the upregulation
  (yellow dots) by more than 2 fold compared with untreated control cells. (A) In
  MCF-7, six genes were upregulated. (B) In MDA, 16 genes were upregulated. (C) The
  schematic diagram represents the upregulation of DNA repair genes in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231cells
  because of treating them with PAC
