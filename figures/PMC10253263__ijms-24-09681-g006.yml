caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway of PNPLA3-I148M-induced activation
  of LX-2 cells. In the presence of PNPLA3-I148M, the expression of the cholesterol
  efflux protein ABCG1 was significantly reduced, leading to the accumulation of FC
  in LX-2 cells and the disruption of mitochondrial cholesterol homeostasis. The diminished
  mitochondrial function and structural damage further promoted the activation of
  LX-2 cells and increased the expression of fibrosis-related factors, which may be
  a key mechanism of PNPLA3-I148M leading to the progression of liver fibrosis. Upward
  arrows indicate upregulation and downward arrows indicate downregulation
