caption: 'Schematic view of hepatic hepcidin regulation by BMP/SMAD pathway and proposed
  potential candidate genes contributing to polygenetic inheritance in monoallelic
  IRIDA. Expression of hepcidin is regulated via the BMP/SMAD pathway, which is activated
  by BMP receptors that bind with BMP coreceptor hemojuvelin (HJV), leading to phosphorylation
  and translocation of the intracellular SMAD proteins to the nucleus. Here they act
  as transcription factors increasing HAMP mRNA transcription. Hepcidin expression
  via this pathway is modulated by three main mechanisms: erythropoiesis, inflammation,
  and iron (stored and circulating). Potential candidate genes in these pathways contributing
  to polygenetic inheritance are indicated by numbers (1 to 7). It is conceivable
  that gain of function mutations of positive regulatory factors and loss of function
  of inhibitors of the BMP/SMAD pathway (e.g., ACVR1 (ALK2)) can lead to an overactivation
  of the hepcidin response, leading to instability of the BMP pathway and, consequently,
  to a potential IRIDA phenotype: red clouds, loss of function (LoF); yellow stars,
  gain of function (GoF). Proposed genes are displayed by number: (1) FKBP1a (FKBP
  prolyl isomerase 1A) (LoF), (2) TMPRSS6 (transmembrane serine protease 6) (LoF),
  (3) BMPR1 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1) (GoF), (4) TFR2 (transferrin
  receptor type 2) (GoF), (5) HFE (homeostatic iron regulator) (GoF), (6) HJV (hemojuvelin)
  (GoF), and (7) HAMP (hepcidin antimicrobial peptide) (GoF). Act-B, activin B; ERFE,
  erythroferrone; IL-6, interleukin 6; Fe3+-Tf, transfferin-bound iron; TfR, transferrin
  receptor; JAK2, Janus kinase 2—inhibiting effect.'
