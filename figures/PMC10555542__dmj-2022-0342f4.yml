figure_title: The three microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially expressed with glimepiride
  treatment; miR-206, miR-182-5p, and miR-766-3p, and their mRNA-associated targets
  with a focus on targets belonging to (A) the gene ontologies/WikiPathways “Cellular
  response to insulin stimulus” (GO:0032869), “Response to insulin” (GO:0032868),
  “Insulin signalling” (WP481), and “Insulin receptor signalling pathway” (GO:0008286),
  and (B) targets belonging to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathway “advanced glycation endproduct/receptor for advanced glycation end product
  (AGE-RAGE) signalling pathway in diabetic complications” (hsa04933).
