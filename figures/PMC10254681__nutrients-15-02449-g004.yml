caption: Effects of different concentrations of SCPs1 on the protein expression of
  cAMP-CREB signaling pathway in B16 cells. (a) Densitometry graphs of the Western
  blot analyses. (b) Protein levels of TYR, TRP-1, TRP-2, MITF, MC1R, p-CREB and CREB
  were examined by Western blot. **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01 and *
  p < 0.05 indicate that there is significant difference between different treatment
  methods and the control group; ns indicates that there is no significant difference
  between different treatments
