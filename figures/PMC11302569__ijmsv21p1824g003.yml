caption: 'Four key mechanisms of gut microbiome associated with the occurrence and
  progression of colorectal cancer a. The inflammation pathway triggered by toxins
  secreted by the gut microbiome, such as Salmonella or E. coli, can lead to chronic
  inflammation and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the mucosal
  lining, resulting in DNA damage. b. Tumor microenvironment (TME): Certain microorganisms
  like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis have the ability to modulate
  the density of different types of T cells, creating a tumor microenvironment that
  promotes tumor initiation and progression. c. Bacterial components can promote tumor
  cell proliferation through the NF-ÎºB pathway, for example, via putative cell wall
  binding repeat 2 (PCWBR2) surface protein produced by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
  d. Senescence and tumor growth can be facilitated by specific strains of E. coli
  that produce colistin-encoded enzymes responsible for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
