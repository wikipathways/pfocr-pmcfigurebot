caption: AT-II combined with IFN-γ suppressed growth and lung metastasis in vivo.
  (A) Images of the xenograft tumors from BALB/c (nu/nu) mice after treatment of IFN-γ
  or AT-II or combination. (B) Tumor volume and (C) tumor weights xenograft tumors
  in each group. (D) Tunel staining showing the levels of cell apoptosis in xenograft
  tumors. Scale bar, 50 µm. HCT-15 cells were injected into another cohort of C57BL/6
  mice through the caudal vein, and lung metastasis was assessed after treatment of
  IFN-γ or AT-II or a combination for 30 days. (E) Image of lung tissues in C57BL/6
  mice in each group, and the statistical analysis of lung metastasis number was performed
  at the experimental endpoint. (F) H&E staining of the lung tissues in lung metastatic
  specimens. Scale bar = 100 μm. (G) Western blot analysis showing the expression
  of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Wnt, β-catenin, Smad1, p-NF-kB p65, NF-kB p65, and PD-L1
  proteins in lung tissues of lung metastatic C57BL/6 mice after treatment of IFN-γ
  or AT-II or combination. ▲P<0.05, ▲▲P<0.01, vs. model group. **P<0.01, vs. IFN-γ
  and AT-II groups.
