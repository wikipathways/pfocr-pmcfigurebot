caption: KEGG (KEGG-GSEA) pathway enrichment analysis reveals dysregulated pathways
  in WCB cells with OSA compared to control samples. KEGG pathway analysis led to
  the identification of 260 significant biological processes, among which, six of
  them were related to apoptosis, insulin resistance and signaling pathway, leukocyte
  endothelial migration, and type 1 diabetes mellitus
