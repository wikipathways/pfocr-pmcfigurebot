figure_title: The schematic view of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma tissue with expression of main cell surface markers (CD44 and CD133),
  transcription factors (SOX2 and NANOG), and selected molecules belonging to crucial
  signaling pathways (SHH, WNT1, and NOTCH1).

  cell carcinoma tissue with expression of main cell surface markers (CD44 and CD133),
  transcription factors (SOX2 and NANOG), and selected molecules belonging to crucial
  signaling pathways (SHH, WNT1, and NOTCH1). Immunohistochemical images were adapted
  from our previous studies [88,89]
