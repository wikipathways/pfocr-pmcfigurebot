caption: The Hippo pathway is a signaling pathway that regulates the self-renewal
  and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Mechanical stresses and
  the presence of VEGF activate the pathway, which promotes HSC retention in the bone
  marrow. MST1/2 and XMU-MP-1, respectively, suppress HSC expansion and ROS signaling.
  LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ copolarize and form a complex in the cytosol with Scribble-Cdc42
  GTPases, which controls HSC self-renewal and asymmetric cell division. Mechanical
  cyclic stretch influences embryonic aortic endothelial cell differentiation into
  HSCs by activating Rho GTPase, an upstream regulator of YAP-mediated mechanotransduction,
  which leads to RUNX1 expression for endothelial-hematopoietic transition (EHT)
