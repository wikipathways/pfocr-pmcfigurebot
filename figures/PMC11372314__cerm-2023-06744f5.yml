caption: Expression of β-catenin at MC3T3-E1 cells during osteogenic differentiation.
  To determine whether the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was involved in this experiment,
  immunocytochemistry and Western blotting were conducted. (A) Immunocytochemistry
  was performed using β-catenin monoclonal antibody coupled with Alexa 488 conjugated
  secondary antibodies (green). There were red arrowheads to point to the presence
  of translocation into nucleus. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used for
  nuclear counterstaining (blue). Fluorescence images were obtained using a Nikon
  Eclipse 80i microscope at ×400 magnification (scale bar=50 μm). Fluorescence intensity
  was evaluated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). (B) β-Catenin
  levels were measured using Western blot analysis. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH) was used as an internal control. OIM, osteogenic induction medium; LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; L, LPS; N, NMN; Co, co-treatment
  of LPS&NMN. a),b)Distinct letters indicate statistically significant differences
