caption: Tn enhances the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in ARPE-19 cells.
  (A) Western blot assays demonstrated that the phosphorylated level of Akt was significantly
  enhanced after Tn pretreatment at a 50 nM concentration. (B) Western blot assays
  revealed that the phosphorylated level of S6 was significantly enhanced after Tn
  pretreatment at 10 and 50 nM concentrations. (C) Western blot assays identified
  that phosphorylated 4EBP-1 increased significantly after being pretreated with Tn.
  (D) Western blot assays showed that the phosphorylated level of p70S6k was significantly
  enhanced after Tn pretreatment at 10 and 50 nM concentrations. Data are expressed
  as the mean Â± standard error of the mean. ***P<0.005 (n=3). Tn, triptonide; Ctrl,
  control; ns, not significant
