figure_title: Species unique MEGENA modules
caption: Unique network modules in (A) human MDM cells, (B) HTBE cells, (C and D)
  mouse lung, and (E) ferret lower lung are shown. Red nodes denote up-regulation,
  and blue nodes denote down-regulation. Diamond-shaped nodes are key regulators.
  Species unique MEGENA modules were identified by enrichment for SRG (JTG) intersection
  signatures from all eight systems. Modules with significant enrichment in one species
  but not in any other were deemed unique. (A) The human (MDM) M104 unique module
  with 30 nodes and 78 edges is ranked number 75 and is responsible for the negative
  regulation of leukocyte activation. CR1L, HLA-G, MNDA, and RBM34 are key regulators
  in this module. Most of the genes in this pathway are up-regulated. (B) The number
  67 ranked regulation of endocannabinoid signaling/endosomal vacuolar pathway with
  114 nodes, 326 edges, and key regulators HDGFRP2, PDGFC, SMPDT, TIPARP, TJAP1, and
  U2AF2 is shown. (C) The number 136 ranked and predominantly down-regulated mouse
  module M473 relevant for sphingolipid signaling has 27 nodes and 67 edges. The sole
  key regulator is ANXA11. (D) M631 is a number 49 ranked and up-regulated mouse module
  responsible for positive regulation of T cell cytokine production with CTSS as a
  single key regulator. M631 has 23 nodes and 57 edges. (E) The number 170 ranked
  ferret lower lung module M14 with 202 nodes and 565 edges shows minichromosome maintenance
  (MCM) and cell cycle functionality. Key regulators are ARHGAP21, ARPC1B, ATP6V0C,
  CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CDC42BPG, CFL1, DPP3, ECT2, ENO1, ENSMPUG00000006004 (putative
  MELK), ENSMPUG00000008504 (putative TRBC2), IFT81, MCM10, MCM4, MKI67, TPPP3, TRAC,
  TRADD, UBE2V1, and UNC93B1.
