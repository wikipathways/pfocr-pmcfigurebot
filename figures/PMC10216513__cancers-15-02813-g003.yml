caption: Transcriptome analysis of patient-derived MPM cell lines, commercial MPM
  cell lines, and MPM tumor material. (a) Hierarchical clustering of all samples using
  the top 100 differentially expressed genes shows 3 distinct clusters representing
  samples from different origins and the non-cancerous Met-5A cell line clustering
  the furthest away from all other samples. (b) Three distinct clusters could be further
  validated using PCA analysis across all genes and all samples (Q = 0.6841). PC1
  represents 35% of variance and PC2 12%. (c) Differential gene expression analysis
  with a significance threshold of 0.01 and a log2 ratio threshold of 0.5 between
  cell lines and tumors shows a downregulation of processes involved in antigen processing
  and presentation, protein transport, actin filament organization and vesicle-mediated
  transport, translation, the ATP biosynthetic process, regulation of mRNA stability,
  NIK/NF-κB signaling, Wnt signaling, the tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling
  pathway, and angiogenesis in tumors compared to cell lines. GO terms related to
  regulation of transcription, chromatin organization, mRNA transcription, RNA splicing,
  mRNA processing, cell–cell signaling, positive regulation of transcription, immune
  response, cell differentiation, inflammatory response, positive regulation of apoptotic
  cell clearance, and positive regulation of cell death were downregulated in cell
  lines compared to tumors. (d) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for Hallmark gene
  sets for tumors vs. patient-derived cell lines and tumors vs. commercial derived
  cell lines (e). Blue bars indicate significant enrichment between groups with FDR
  q values < 0.25. Red bars indicate non-significant FDR q values > 0.25. A positive
  Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) indicates enrichment in patient-derived cell lines
  or commercial cell lines, respectively; a negative NES indicates enrichment in
