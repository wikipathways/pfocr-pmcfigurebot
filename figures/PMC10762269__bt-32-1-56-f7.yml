caption: Diagram showing the molecular cascades involved in the biased signaling pathways
  of dopamine D2 receptor. The G protein pathway is responsible for D2R-mediated adenylyl
  cyclase inhibition, while the arrestin pathway is involved in arrestin ubiquitination
  and receptor endocytosis. In terms of regulating ERK, the G protein pathway induces
  ERK activation in the cytosol. In contrast, the arrestin pathway facilitates ERK
  activation within the nucleus, followed by the translocation of phosphorylated ERK
  to the cytosol. Gi/o, inhibitory/other heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding
  proteins; AC, adenylyl cyclase; impo, importin α/β; ERK-p, phospho-ERK
