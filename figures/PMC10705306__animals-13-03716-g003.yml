figure_title: The metabolites and their metabolic pathway analysis in cecal digesta.
caption: The metabolites and their metabolic pathway analysis in cecal digesta. (a)
  Score scatter plot of PCA model. (b) Score scatter plot of OPLS-DA model. (c) Permutation
  test of OPLS-DA model. (d) Volcano plots. The red dots mean up-regulated, and the
  blue dots mean down-regulated. (e) Hierarchical clustering analysis. (f) Topology
  analysis of metabolic pathway. The X-axis and Y-axis, respectively, represent the
  rich factor and the negative nature logarithm of the p-value. PCA, principal component
  analysis; OPLS-DA, orthogonal projections to latent structuresâ€“discriminant analysis
