caption: 'GA inhibited LPS-induced inflammation in Caco-2 cellsCaco-2 cells pretreated
  with or without 1, 5 or 10 μg/mL GA for 24 h were exposed to 10 μg/mL LPS for an
  additional 4 h. qRT-PCR was utilized to measure the mRNA levels of inflammatory
  cytokines, such as (A) inos, (B) il-6, (C) tnf-α, (D) il-1β, (E) il-10, (F) tgf-β1,
  and (G) tgf-β2. The data were standardized to the mRNA expression of β-actin. (H)
  TLR4 protein expression was assessed via western blot analysis. (I) Relative level
  of TLR4 protein. The values were standardized to the β-actin level. Data are shown
  as the mean±SEM, n=6. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 compared to the control. #P<0.05 and
  ##P<0.01 compared to the LPS group. GA: gallic acid.'
