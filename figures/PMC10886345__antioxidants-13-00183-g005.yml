  BMSC-Exos regulate autophagy and TJ function through the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. (A) SCs are subjected to D-gal (50 g/L) and/or BMSC-Exos (20 μg/mL) processing for 48 h. The protein expressions of p-mTOR, mTOR, p-AKT, AKT, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-AMPK, and AMPK are investigated using Western blotting. (B) Western blotting is performed to examine the relative expressions of p-mTOR, mTOR, p-AMPK, and AMPK proteins obtained from porcine testes. (C) SCs receive 48 h of treatment with D-gal (50 g/L), CC (10 μM), and/or BMSC-Exos (20 μg/mL). Western blotting for protein expressions of Beclin-1, LC3, NLRP3, IL-1β, ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-11 is accomplished with β-actin as the loading control and the values exhibited in the format of mean ± SD; ** p < 0.01 vs. the control group; ##
  p < 0.01 vs. the D-gal treatment group
