figure_title: NPs regulate ROS to activate the JNK/HO-1/FTH1 signaling pathway to
  induce ferroptosis in BV2 cells.
caption: NPs regulate ROS to activate the JNK/HO-1/FTH1 signaling pathway to induce
  ferroptosis in BV2 cells. (A) NAC treatment downregulated expression of (B) JNK
  and (C) HO-1. (D) BV2 cells were pretreated with SP600125 (2 ÂµM) for 1 h and exposed
  to NPs for 12 h. The expression levels of ferroptosis-associated proteins were detected
  by western blotting. NAC treatment downregulated expression of (E) TFRC, (F) FACL4
  and (H) COX-2, upregulated expression of (G) FTH1, (I) XCT, (J) GPX4. (K) Fluorescence
  intensity of Fe2+. (L) SP600125 treatment downregulated fluorescence intensity of
  Fe2+. NP, nanoplastic; ROS, reactive oxygen species; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; FTH1,
  ferritin heavy chain 1; p-, phosphorylated; TFRC, transferrin receptor; FACL4, acyl-CoA
  synthetase long-chain family member 4; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; XCT, solute carrier
  family 7 member 11; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
