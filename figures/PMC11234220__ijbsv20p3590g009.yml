figure_title: Function annotation of the TTCRRS signature based on the TCGA cohort.
caption: Function annotation of the TTCRRS signature based on the TCGA cohort. (A)
  The relationship between TTCRRS and 28 immune cell infiltrations. (B) Chorogram
  plot depicts the Pearson r value between TTCRRS and immune cell infiltrations in
  TCGA and Meta cohorts. (C) Violin plot shows the relationship between 28 immune
  cell infiltrations and the TTCRRS subtype. (D) Difference in pathway activities
  scored per patient by GSVA between high- and low-TTCRRS. Shown are t values from
  a linear model. (E) Butterfly plot illustrates the correlation between the TTCRRS
  and metabolic pathways, the enrichment pathways based on GSVA of GO and KEGG terms.
  (F) Scatterplots between CD8A and PD0-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 with the TTCRRS were shown
  in the TCGA-KIRC
