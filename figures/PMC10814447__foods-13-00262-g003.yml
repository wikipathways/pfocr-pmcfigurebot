  and FSC metabolomes.
caption: Principal component analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis of the SC and FSC
  metabolomes. Principal component analysis of the positive (a) and negative (b) ionization
  mode data. KEGG enrichment analysis of the data from positive (c) and negative (d)
  ionization mode. The linear distance between the two samples in (a,b) represents
  the difference in the metabolites. The horizontal axis in the figure is x/y (the
  number of differentially abundant metabolites in the corresponding metabolic pathway/the
  total number of metabolites identified in the pathway), and the higher the value
  is, the more differentially abundant metabolites in the pathway there are. The color
  of the dot indicates the p value from the hypergeometric test, and the smaller the
  value is, the greater the reliability of the test and statistical significance of
  the difference. The size of the dot represents the number of differentially abundant
  metabolites in the corresponding pathway, and the larger the dot is, the more differentially
  abundant metabolites there are in the pathway
