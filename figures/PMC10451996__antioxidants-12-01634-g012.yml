caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism by which fibroblast upregulation of VDR
  suppresses lung fibroblast proliferation and activation during pulmonary fibrosis.
  VDR is specifically upregulated in lung fibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis. Upon
  activation, VDR attenuates lung fibroblast proliferation and activation. The anti-fibrotic
  effects of vitamin D/VDR signaling may be at least partly due to suppression of
  ER stress in lung fibroblasts. In this study, we have identified JAK1/STAT3 as an
  upstream regulator of ER stress in fibroblasts. VDR activation inhibits enrichment
  of STAT3 to ATF6 promoter, thus suppressing ATF6 expression in fibroblasts. Collectively,
  this study suggests that fibroblast VDR upregulation may be a self-protective response
  to limit fibroblast proliferation and activation during pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing
  JAK1/STAT3/ER stress pathway
