figure_title: Changes in subcellular localization of Ras upon S-nitrosylation.
caption: 'Changes in subcellular localization of Ras upon S-nitrosylation. (A) S-Nitrosylation
  of the cytoplasmatic H-Ras by CysNO inhibits the integration of the protein into
  the plasma membrane, resulting in an enhancement of the GTPase activity. S-Nitrosylation
  of the membrane-anchored H-Ras by CysNO diminishes the rate of GTP hydrolysis, in
  a model of membrane system [44]. (B) In hypoxic conditions (high NO levels simulated
  by SNP exposure), Ras is S-nitrosylated with the consequent translocation of the
  protein from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm in PC12 cells. In these conditions,
  a shift from the Ras/ERK signaling pathway to the PI3K/HIF-1-alpha pathway occurred.
  In normoxic conditions, H-Ras remains associated with the plasma membrane [40,57].
  (C) Parallel S-nitrosylation of both Src kinase and H-Ras in HeLa cells by means
  of GSNO. S-Nitrosylation activates the membrane-bound H-Ras with the subsequent
  stimulation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. S-Nitrosylation of Src phosphorylates PLC-γ,
  ensuing the synthesis of DAG and an increased intracellular Ca2+. The translocation
  of H-Ras from the cytoplasm to the Golgi occurs, where H-Ras is activated, which
  further contributes to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 [41]. (D) Activation of the
  bradykin-receptor/Akt signaling results in eNOS-derived NO production. This translates
  into S-nitrosylation of the membrane-bound H-Ras and stimulation of the ERK1/2 pathway,
  in HUVEC cells. In these conditions, the Golgi-associated H-Ras will not be activated
  [41]. (E) Activation of Golgi-associated N-Ras by eNOS-derived NO, following T cell
  receptor stimulation in T-cells [42,58]. AKT: protein kinase B (PKB), BK: bradykinin,
  BK-R: bradykinin receptor, CysNO: S-nitrosocysteine, DAG: diacylglycerol, eNOS:
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase, ERK1/2: extracellular signal-related kinases
  1 and 2, GDP: guanosine diphosphate, GSNO: S-nitrosoglutathione, GTP: guanosine
  triphosphate, HIF1a: hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha, NO: nitric oxide,
  PI3K: phosphoinositide-3 kinase, PLC: phospholipase C, SNP: sodium nitroprusside,
  Src: non-receptor protein–tyrosine kinase (sarcoma), TCR: T cell receptor. Arrows
