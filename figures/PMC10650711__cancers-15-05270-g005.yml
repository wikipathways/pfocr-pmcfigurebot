caption: EHF suppressed EMT through the STAT3 signaling pathway. (A) Western blot
  assay showing p-STAT3, STAT3, and Flag-EHF protein levels of MDA-MB-231 cells after
  transfection with pCMV-Taq2B (mock) and pCMV6-Entry-EHF (EHF). (B) Western blot
  assay showing p-STAT3, STAT3, and Flag-EHF protein levels in MDA-MB-453 cells after
  transfection with pCMV-Taq2B (mock) and pCMV6-Entry-EHF (EHF). (C) RT-qPCR data
  showing a relative EHF expression in MDA-MB-231-NDRG2 cells after transfection with
  control siRNA and two siRNAs (number 1 (#1) and number 2 (#2)) against EHF (left).
  Western blot assay showing p-STAT3, STAT3, and EHF protein levels of MDA-MB-231-NDRG2
  cells after the transfection of control siRNA and two siRNAs against EHF (right).
  (D) Western blot assay showing p-STAT3 and STAT3 protein levels in MDA-MB-231-mock
  and -EHF cells. *** p < 0.001
