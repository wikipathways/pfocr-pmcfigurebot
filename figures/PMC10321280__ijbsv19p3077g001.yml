caption: 'Xanthurenic acid is identified as the metabolic marker of MI. A. Metabolite
  pathway of MI. Compared with the sham group, elevated metabolites in MI mice were
  labeled red, and the reduced metabolites were labeled green. B. Results of heat
  map analysis of the four potential metabolic biomarkers. Red represents high content
  and green represents low content (n = 6). C. Changes in the content of xanthurenic
  acid (XA), 2-arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine, 7-methylguanine, and fructoselysine
  in sham and MI model groups mice during CAL 3 weeks (n = 7-10). D. Changes in the
  content of xanthurenic acid, 2-arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine in normal healthy
  persons (n = 23) and MI patients (n = 41). All metabolites in biological samples
  were detected by LC-MS. E. Evaluation of sensitivity and specificity of xanthurenic
  acid and 2-arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine in the diagnosis of MI patients. Analysis
  of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on the targeted quantitative
  results of metabolites in clinical samples. Data are presented as mean Â± SD. #p<0.05,
  ##p<0.01 vs. sham group or normal group'
