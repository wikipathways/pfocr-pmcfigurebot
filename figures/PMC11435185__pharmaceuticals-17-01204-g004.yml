caption: IMD up-regulates CPT-1β. RNA-sequencing analysis of hearts in mice. (A) Volcano
  plot showing the transcript expression profiles of differentially expressed genes
  in the hearts of the WT diabetic mice, respectively. n = 3. (B) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis showing the 20 most significantly enriched signaling pathways for differentially
  expressed genes in the hearts of WT diabetic mice. n = 3. (C) Heat map of the microarray
  results showing the 36 (ranked by p-values) differentially expressed fatty acid
  metabolism genes in hearts from the WT diabetic mice. Red, up-regulated; blue, down-regulated;
  white, no change. n = 3. (D) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of Cpt1b mRNA expression
  in the hearts of WT diabetic mice and diabetic rats. n = 4. (E) Volcano plot showing
  the transcript expression profiles of differentially expressed genes in the hearts
  from the diabetic WT and IMD−/− mice, respectively. n = 3. (F) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis showing the 20 most significantly enriched signaling pathways for differentially
  expressed genes in the hearts of diabetic WT and IMD−/− mice. n = 3. (G) Heat map
  of the microarray results showing the 28 (ranked by p-values) differentially expressed
  fatty acid metabolism genes in hearts from the diabetic WT and IMD−/− mice. Red,
  up-regulated; blue, down-regulated; white, no change. n = 3. (H) Quantitative real-time
  PCR analysis of Cpt1b mRNA expression in the hearts of diabetic WT and IMD−/− mice.
  n = 4. (I) Heat map of the microarray results showing the 23 (ranked by P-values)
  differentially expressed fatty acid metabolism genes in hearts from the diabetic
  WT and IMDtg mice. Red, up-regulated; blue, down-regulated; white, no change. n
  = 3. (J) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of Cpt1b mRNA expression in the hearts
  of diabetic WT and IMDtg mice. n = 4. Data are mean ± SD, ** p < 0.01
