caption: |-
  NKT inhibited ROS production and upregulated the antioxidant enzyme expression via Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in rat primary astrocytes. (A) Rat primary astrocytes were treated with NKT prior to MPP+ stimulation for 16 h, and intracellular ROS level was evaluated with CellROX staining (n = 3). Representative fluorescence images are shown in the left panel, and the quantification of fluorescence intensity is shown in the right panel. (B) Astrocyte cells were incubated with NKT for 6 h to determine the effects of NKT on the protein expression of HO-1, NQO1, and MnSOD (n = 3). (C) RT-PCR results demonstrating the influence of NKT on mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes (n = 3). (D) Effect of NKT on intracellular GSH level in astrocytes (n = 3). (E) Effect of NKT on GCLC and GCLM protein expression (n = 3). Quantification data of Western blot analysis are shown in right panel. (F) RT-PCR results demonstrating the influence of NKT on mRNA expression of GCLC and GCLM (n = 3). (G) Western blot data showing the effect of NKT on nuclear translocation of Nrf2. (H) EMSA data showing the effect of NKT on Nrf2 DNA binding activity. ‘F’ indicates free probe. (I) Effect of NKT on ARE-luc reporter gene activity. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05 vs. control cells; ** p < 0.01 vs. control cells; ##
  p < 0.01 vs. MPP+-treated cells
