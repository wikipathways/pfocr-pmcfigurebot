caption: 'TRQ combined with gefitinib inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis
  in NSCLC 2D cell lines. (A) The Chromatographic assay of TRQ and major components
  including Baicalin, Ursodeoxycholic acid and Chenodeoxycholic acid. (B, C) After
  cell lines were treated with TRQ or gefitinib for 48 h, CCK-8 assay was performed
  to detect the cell viability. (D-F) The effect of TRQ alone or in combination with
  gefitinib on proliferation of lung cancer cells. (G) Cell apoptosis rate was detected
  after treated with gefitinib (2.5 μM), TRQ (0.6%) alone or together in lung cancer
  cells. Data were shown as means ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05
  versus the control group, #P < 0.05 versus the gefitinib alone group, **P or ##P
  < 0.01, ***P or ###P < 0.001. TRQ, Tanreqing injection; Gefi, gefitinib; PC-9-PIK3CA-M,
  PC-9-PIK3CA-mutation.'
