figure_title: Upregulated genes in the brains of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice.
caption: 'Upregulated genes in the brains of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Heatmaps showing
  the fold change in expression levels of specific genes involved in the following
  signaling pathways: (A) Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway (KEGG pathway:
  mmu04620), (B) RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) and cytosolic DNA sensing pathway (KEGG
  pathway: mmu04622 and mmu04623, respectively), (C) cytokine and receptor interaction
  (KEGG pathway: mmu04060), (D) nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway (KEGG
  pathway: mmu04064), (E) tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway (KEGG pathway:
  mmu04668), and (F) cell death (KEGG pathway: mmu04210 and mmu04217). Red indicates
  the genes were upregulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection'
