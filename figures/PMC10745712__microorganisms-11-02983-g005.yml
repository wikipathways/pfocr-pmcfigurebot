caption: 'Influence of the B. subtilis 26D strain (Bs26D) on the relative expression
  of genes the SA signaling pathway, TaWRKY13 (A), the JA signaling pathway, TaERF1
  (B), the ethylene signaling pathway, TaEIN3 (C) and the ABA signaling pathway, TaABI5
  (D) in wheat plants infested with bird cherry-oat aphid R. padi. The samples are
  indicated as follows: Control—non-bacterized plants and unpopulated with aphids;
  Bs26D—plants treated with the B. subtilis 26D strain before sowing; R. padi—plants
  populated with aphids; Bs26D + R. padi—bacterized plants and populated with aphids.
  Figures present means ± SE (n = 6). Columns of each histogram marked with different
  letters represent the mean values that are statistically different from each other
  according to Duncan’s test (p ≤ 0.05)'
