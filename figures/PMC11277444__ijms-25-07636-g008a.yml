figure_title: Expression patterns of the key enzyme genes and UrSINA genes in roots
  under ABA treatment.
caption: Expression patterns of the key enzyme genes and UrSINA genes in roots under
  ABA treatment. (a). Expression analysis of 10 UrSINA genes in U. rhynchophylla roots
  under ABA treatment. (b). Expression patterns of the 12 key enzyme genes in roots
  under ABA treatment. (c). The correlation between the gene expression patterns of
  UrSINA and related genes in the pathway in roots under ABA treatment. The red represents
  positively correlated, and blue represents negatively correlated. The final results
  were calculated as the mean Â± standard deviation. * and ** indicate p-values < 0.05
  and <0.01, respectively
