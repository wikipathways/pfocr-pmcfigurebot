caption: Compartment changes following ICG-001 treatment in pancreatic cancer cells.
  (A) Heatmaps and C-scores of Hi-C data in PATC53 cells. (B) Illustration of compartment
  changes. (C) Percentage of compartment changes both in PANC1 and PATC53. (D) Enrichment
  of insulin signaling pathway with GSEA from genes located at regions with absolute
  values of C-score difference greater than 1.
