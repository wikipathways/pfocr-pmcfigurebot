caption: Prospective application of lncRNAs in the treatment of diabetic wounds. (a)
  Stem cell therapy promotes diabetic wound healing. LncRNA MALAT1 acts as a sponge
  for miR-205-5p to promote the repairing effect of epidermal stem cells (ESCs) on
  DFUs. Exosomes secreted from different sources (ADSCs) (MSCs) contain lncRNA H19
  to accelerate wound healing through two different pathways. lncRNA ANRIL is involved
  in the induction of tissue epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). (b) Autologous
  blood transfusion. H19 accelerates fibroblast activation by recruiting ezh2-mediated
  histone methylation and regulating the HIF-1α signalling pathway, thereby enhancing
  autologous blood transfusion and promoting postoperative wound healing in diabetic
  mice. (c) Clinical studies of lncRNA-based drugs. Most drugs have potential lncRNA
  binding sites. Melatonin attenuates diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) by inhibiting
  lncRNA malat1-mediated NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles and the TGF-β1/Smad signalling
  pathway. (d) LncRNA drug delivery system. The use of different nanoparticles and
  extracellular vesicles (EVs) as carriers of lncRNA complexes for exogenous supplementation
  or inhibition of related lncRNAs to restore normal expression levels and accelerate
  diabetic wound healing
