caption: 'MEETL3 plays a crucial role in the progression of prostate cancer. METTL3
  expression levels increase in prostate cancer cells, but decrease in tumor-associated
  macrophages. METTL3 plays a role in the malignant progression of prostate cancer
  mainly through the following six pathways: i) An increase in the content of ARHGDIA
  promotes an increase in the total m6A level; ii) an increase in the total m6A level
  activates the SHH-GLI1 signaling pathway; and iii) an increase in the m6A modification
  of LEF1 mRNA activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway; iv) lncRNA MALAT1 m6A modification
  increases the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; v) the increased modification
  of MYC mRNA m6A leads to an increase in the MYC content; vi) the KIF3C m6A modification
  increases the stability of KIF3C mRNA. In addition, METTL3 is expressed at low levels
  in tumor-related macrophages, promoting the proliferation, migration, and metastasis
  of prostate cancer by inhibiting the activation of STAT6 and leading to the activation
  of M2 macrophages. The low-level expression of METTL3 in tumor-associated macrophages
  exerts its anti-prostate cancer effect by inhibiting the methylation of STAT1 mRNA
  and promoting the activation of M1 macrophages. METTL, methyltransferase-like; ALKBH,
  alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase homolog; SHH, Sonic hedgehog; GLI1, -GLI
  family zinc finger 1; KIF3C, kinesin superfamily protein 3C'
