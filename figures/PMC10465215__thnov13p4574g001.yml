caption: Landscape of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in gastric cancer (GEO cohort).
  (A) The mechanism of HDACs in cells. (B) Association of HDAC expression with ten
  cancer-related pathways. (C) Correlation between HDAC mRNA expression levels and
  immune cell infiltration. (D) Three gastric cancer subtypes with significant prognostic
  differences as identified by the mRNA expression of HDACs. (E) KEGG functional enrichment
  analysis to understand the characteristics of different HDAC clusters. (F) The difference
  in TME cell infiltration levels between different HDAC clusters (CIBERSORT algorithm)
