  H2O2 groups.
caption: RNA-Seq results of H9c2 cells treated with H2O2, CK, ACN, and ACN + H2O2
  groups. (A) Box plots illustrating the distribution of FPKM values. (B) Hierarchical
  clustering analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes among groups.
  (C,D) Metabolic pathway diagrams of H9c2 cells treated with H2O2 (C) and ACN + H2O2
  (D). (E) mRNA levels of PTEN protein in cells of each group. (F) Expression levels
  of PTEN-Akt pathway-related proteins in cells of each group
