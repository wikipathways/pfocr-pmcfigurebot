caption: HCMV regulates the Notch signaling pathway. When Notch receptor binds to
  Notch ligand, Notch receptor is cleaved by ADAM10 and Î³-secretase, leading to the
  release of Notch intracellular structural domain (NICD). NICD fragment is the active
  form of the receptor that binds to the CSL transcription factor to trigger the transcription
  of the Notch target genes. Hes proteins also promote the phosphorylation and activation
  of STAT3, and the activated STAT3 shuttles to the nucleus to bind the Sox2 promoter
  and induce its expression. HCMV is a membrane protein that regulates Notch signaling
  pathway phosphorylation and activation and activated STAT3 shuttles to the nucleus
  to bind the Sox2 promoter and induce its expression. HCMV periplasmic protein pp71
  can alter the cellular localization of Jag1 and NICD and inhibit Notch signaling
  by promoting their degradation via the proteasome. HCMV IE1 promotes proteasomal
  degradation of Hes1 to inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT3 and promotes the accumulation
  of unphosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus and inhibits Sox2 transcription
