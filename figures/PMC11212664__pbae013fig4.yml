caption: MyD88 inhibition induced the upregulation of the NOD-like receptor signaling
  pathway in mice with DSS-induced colitis. (A) RNA-sequencing was performed with
  isolated colon tissue from mice with DSS-induced colitis treated with PBS or TJ5.
  The heat map indicated the differentially expressed genes by clustering analysis.
  (B) Differentially expressed genes (DSS + PBS group versus DSS + TJ5 group) were
  analyzed by KEGG enrichment analysis. (C) Differentially expressed genes (DSS + PBS
  group versus DSS + TJ5 group) associated with the NLR signaling pathway were identified
  by RT-PCR. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
article_title: Suppression of MyD88 disturbs gut microbiota and activates the NLR
  pathway and hence fails to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis.
