  pathway.
caption: ZIC2 up-regulates UBE2C expression and activates AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
  (A) Differentially expressed between high- and low-expression ZIC2 in TCGA dataset.
  (B) GSEA analysis for signaling pathways enriched in highly expressing ZIC2. (C)
  The intersection of the high ZIC2 expression -induced gene and the potential target
  gene of ZIC2. (D) List of genes most associated with ZIC2 expression. (E) Knockdown
  of ZIC2 significantly inhibited UBE2C expression. (F) ZIC2 knockdown significantly
  inhibited UBE2C protein expression and AKT/mTOR signaling pathway activation. (G)
  Transcriptional binding motifs of ZIC2 and potential binding sites to UBE2C. (H)
  Chip-PCR confirmed the binding of ZIC2 to the UBE2C promoter. (I) Luciferase reporter
  experiments confirmed the UBE2C binding site sequence by ZIC2
