caption: Venn diagrams illustrate the overlap and number of differential metabolites
  (pre- vs. post-FMT) among the various therapeutic groups in the negative mode (a)
  and positive mode (b). The numbers in the red circles represent the number of differential
  metabolites shared in the remission and response groups, non-remission and non-response
  groups in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Pathway and enrichment
  analyses of differential metabolites (pre- vs. post-FMT) in the response group.
  Bubble diagram of metabolic pathway enrichment based on the differential metabolites
  (pre vs. post FMT) in the response group (c). One bubble represents one metabolic
  pathway. Data is plotted as significance (âˆ’log10(p)) versus pathway impact. The
  top 23 enrichment pathways are listed on the right (d)
