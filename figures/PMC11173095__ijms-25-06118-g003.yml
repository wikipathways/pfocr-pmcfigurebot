figure_title: VEGF signaling pathway.
caption: VEGF signaling pathway. VEGF binds to VEGFR-2 receptors on the surface of
  endothelial cells to promote cellular proliferation and migration, vascular permeability,
  and gene expression. Ultimately, VEGF induces angiogenesis through numerous pathways.
  This figure provides a simplification of VEGF signaling in angiogenesis with mention
  of key factors and pathways, including Src, SCK, Grb2, SHB, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, PLCÎ³/PKC,
  and PI3K-Akt [58,72]. Created with BioRender.com. VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
  factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
