figure_title: Application of bifunctional elements in lycopene synthesis pathway.
caption: Application of bifunctional elements in lycopene synthesis pathway. (A) The
  detailed genotype of engineered strains. Strains Sl-1, Sl-2 and Sl-3 were constructed
  using bifunctional elements. Strain Tl-1 was obtained using the native promoters
  and terminators. (B) Lycopene production and relative mRNA with engineered yeasts.
  Relative mRNA levels were calculated based on the mRNA level of the reference gene
  TUB1. Error bars indicate ± SD. Data are means ± SD (n = 3)
