figure_title: 'Effects of EMQ on the MAPK signaling pathway in RAW264.7 macrophages
  induced by LPS. The cells were treated with EMQ (25, 50, 100, or 200 µg/ml) for
  12 hours prior to the addition of LPS (1 µg/ml), and the cells were incubated for
  24 hours. The p-p38, p38, p-JNK, JNK, p-ERK, and ERK protein levels were determined
  by western blot analysis (A). Relative protein expression was determined by densitometry
  (B~D). Data represent the means of three independent experiments±standard deviation.
