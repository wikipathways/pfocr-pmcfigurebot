caption: 'The interplay of pyroptosis pathways and immune cell activation in tumor
  immunity. The diagram illustrates the orchestrated pathways of pyroptosis, a form
  of cell death that contributes to tumor immunity by engaging various immune cells
  and inflammatory processes. Initiation of pyroptosis can occur through different
  mechanisms: the canonical inflammasome pathway, which is activated by DAMPs and
  PAMPs leading to NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation; and the non-canonical
  inflammasome pathway, initiated by factors such as LPS and recognized by TLR4, activating
  caspase-4/5/11. These pathways converge on the cleavage of GSDMD, resulting in the
  formation of pores in the cell membrane and cell lysis. CTLs and NK cells secrete
  granzymes that cleave GSDME and GSDMB, further propagating pyroptosis. Active caspase-3,
  influenced by signals such as TNF-α, antibiotics, and chemotherapy, also contributes
  to the activation of GSDME and GSDMC, leading to cell rupture. The outcome is the
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-22, HMGB1) and danger signals
  that prompt the recruitment and activation of various immune cells, including dendritic
  cells (DCs), CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).
  This immunological response culminates in a heightened anti-tumor activity, as the
  activated immune cells induce further pyroptosis in the cancer cells, creating a
  feedback loop that amplifies the anti-tumor immune response. The representation
  captures the complexity of pyroptosis and its significant role in enhancing the
  efficacy of immune-mediated cancer therapies.'
