  pathway in HeLa cells.
caption: AQP3 regulates Syk phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway in HeLa cells. (A) Collection of lentiviral control (sh-control) HeLa cells
  loaded with Green Fluorescent Protein Tag (GFP), CO-Immunoprecipitation detection
  analyzes the interaction of AQP3 and NOX4 complexes in HeLa cells. (B) Control and
  AQP3-49-shRNA HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations of TGF-β1 for
  30 minutes, and the phosphorylation levels of Syk and PI3K/Akt were analyzed by
  western blot. (C) Western blot was used to detect the expression of Syk, PI3K p85α,
  and Akt phosphorylation in control and AQP3-49-shRNA HeLa cells treated with 200
  μM H2O2 at different times. β-Actin was used as a loading control. Data were presented
  as mean ± SD. *, P < 0.05, **, P < 0.01
