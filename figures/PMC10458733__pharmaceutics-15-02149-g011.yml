  signaling pathway (A–K).
caption: Effect of Br-MSCs and/or their derived EXOs on the renal TGF-β/Smad/fibrotic
  signaling pathway (A–K). (A) Relative expression of TGF-β/Gapdh (% control), (B)
  relative expression of Smad-3/Gapdh (% control), (C) relative expression of Smad-7/Gapdh
  (% control), (D) relative expression of Coli-1/Gapdh (% control), (E) photomicrographs
  of Masson trichrome-stained sections showing collagen deposition in between cortical
  structures (arrow head) in control group showed minimal collagen fibers among the
  glomerular capillaries (G) and in the interstitial in between the renal tubules
  (T), (F,G) photomicrographs of Masson trichrome-stained sections showing collagen
  deposition in between cortical structures (arrow head) in nephropathy and nephropathy
  + CM groups showed many collagen fibers among the glomerular capillaries (G) and
  in the interstitial in between the renal tubules (T), (H,I) photomicrographs of
  Masson trichrome-stained sections showing collagen deposition in between cortical
  structures (arrow head) in nephropathy + MSCs and nephropathy + EXOs groups showed
  a reduction in the amount of collagen fibers among the glomerular capillaries (G)
  and in the interstitial in between the renal tubules (T), (J) photomicrographs of
  Masson trichrome-stained sections showing collagen deposition in between cortical
  structures (arrow head) in nephropathy + MSCs + EXOs group showed minimal collagen
  fibers among the glomerular capillaries (G) and in the interstitial in between the
  renal tubules (T), and (K) Masson trichrome collagen deposition area %. Values are
  the mean of (n) 6–8 rats per group ± S.E.M. * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001. (P62 immunoperoxidase
  stain counterstained with H.; X400, Scale bar = 50 μm.) (Modified Masson trichrome
  × 400, Scale bar = 50 μm.)
