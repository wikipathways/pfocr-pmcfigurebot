figure_title: CTLA4 drives tumor-specific iTreg differentiation in Treg-depleted mice
  and dual Treg depletion and CTLA4 blockade enable effector differentiation and metabolic
  re-organization
caption: (A) On day 5 after PyMG administration, mice received isotype control, anti-CD3
  alone, anti-CD28 alone, or dual anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Cell proliferation
  of CD4 SMARTA TTS cells in dLN was analyzed on day 8.(B and C) FoxP3-DTR mice were
  treated on days 0 and 2 with DT, and on days 0, 2, and 5 with CTLA4-blocking or
  isotype antibodies. </p/> (B) Expression of FoxP3 and Bcl6 by SMARTA cells. Bar
  graphs show the frequency (left) and number (right) of FoxP3+ SMARTA cells.(C) Cytokine
  production by CD4 SMARTA TTS cells after ex vivo restimulation.(D–H) FoxP3-DTR mice
  were treated on days 0 and 2 with PBS or DT; and/or on days 0, 2, and 5 with CTLA4-blocking
  or isotype antibodies. Analysis was performed on dLN SMARTA TTS cells on day 8 after
  PyMG administration.(D) UMAP plots show Seurat clustering (resolution 0.3) of CD4
  SMARTA TTS cells s in each condition. Bar graph depicts the proportion of each cluster.
  The numbers in the stacked bar graphs indicate the cluster.(E) Monocle trajectory
  analysis overlaid onto the Seurat clustered UMAP (all conditions combined).(F–H)
  IPA pathways enrichment scoring of the indicated clusters. All pathways are significant
  with a p value < 0.05. For (A)–(C), the data represent three independent experiments
  with at least five mice per group. Error bars indicate SD. Significance is determined
  by Mann-Whitney U test. *p < 0.05
