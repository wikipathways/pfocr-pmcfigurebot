caption: 'Genes involved in the biosynthesis of salicylic acid (SA) are transiently
  upregulated in Norway spruce bark in response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment.
  Expression profiles of genes displaying a significantly (adjusted p < 0.001) altered
  expression pattern across time as a result of MeJA treatment and which were annotated
  as encoding for enzymes and transporters involved in the biosynthesis of SA (yellow
  boxes). In the plots, faint lines indicate the mean expression profiles, with 95%
  confidence intervals, of individual transcripts and the thicker lines depict the
  mean per protein category profile, for water (blue) and MeJA (red) treatments. Read
  counts were normalised using the variance stabilising transformation (vst) in DEseq.
  2. The pathway is based on what is known about the biosynthesis of SA in angiosperms.
  Enzymes in grey are involved in the biosynthesis pathway but no differentially expressed
  genes were annotated to encode for them. Due to space limitations not all enzymes
  have associated expression profiles, see Data Set  for the full list of differentially
  expressed biosynthesis genes. Compound abbreviations: DQ, 3‐dehydroquinate; DHS,
  3‐dehydroshikimate; Shikimate‐3‐P, shikimate 3‐phosphate; EPSP; 5‐enolpyruvoyl‐shikimate
  3‐phosphate; t‐CA, trans‐cinnamic acid. Enzyme/transporter abbreviations: ADT/PDT,
  arogenate dehydratase/prephenate dehydratase (annotated as being encoded for by
  the same genes); AO, aldehyde oxidase; BA2H, benzoic acid 2‐hydroxylase; CM1, chorismate
  mutase 1; CM2, chorismate mutase 2; CS, chorismate synthase; DHQ‐SDH, dehydroquinate‐shikimate
  dehydrogenase; EDS5, ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 5; EPSPS, 5‐enolpyruvylshikimate‐3‐phosphate
  synthase; ICS, isochorismate synthase; IGS, isochorismoyl‐glutamate synthase; IPGL,
  IC‐9‐Glu pyruvoyl‐glutamate lyase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase; pCAT, plastidial
  cationic amino‐acid transporter; PPA, prephenate aminotransferase; PPY, phenylpyruvate
  aminotransferase; SK, shikimate kinase; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase [Color figure
