figure_title: Correlation analysis of rumen microbiota with ADG, enzyme activity,
  antioxidant indexes and immune indexes, and metabolites.
caption: 'Correlation analysis of rumen microbiota with ADG, enzyme activity, antioxidant
  indexes and immune indexes, and metabolites. Red and blue colors represent positive
  and negative correlations, respectively, and color gradation indicates the size
  of the correlation coefficient. Significant correlations are noted by: * 0.01 <
  p ≤ 0.05; ** 0.01 < p ≤ 0.001; and *** p < 0.001 (n = 4). (A) Correlation analysis
  of rumen microbiota with ADG, enzyme activity, and antioxidant indexes and immune
  indexes. ADG = average daily gain; IgG = immunoglobulin G; IgA = immunoglobulin
  A; INF-γ = interferon-γ; IL-4 = interleukin 4; TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-α;
  IL-10 = interleukin 10; IL-1β = interleukin-1β; IL-2 = interleukin-2; and IL-6 =
  interleukin 6. (B,C) Heat map of correlation between differential bacteria and metabolites
  in key metabolic pathways in the Control group vs. the PFDG-15% group and the Control
  group vs. the PFDG-30% group, respectively. Control, PFDG-15%, and PFDG-30% represent
  the group without PFDG supplementation, the group with 15% PFDG substituting for
  15% concentrate, and the group with 30% PFDG substituting for 30% concentrate, respectively'
