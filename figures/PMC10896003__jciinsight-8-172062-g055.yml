figure_title: Immune cell clustering, gene expression profile, and macrophage-expressing
  proangiogenetic molecule identification
caption: (A and B) Representative UMAP plot of the 9 different cluster of immune cells
  is shown in A, while UMAP plot for each sample is shown in B. (C) Dot plot for the
  most common markers for macrophages, DCs, NK cells, and B and T lymphocytes. Cell
  type classification and the percentage and average expression of the specific cell
  markers are shown. (D) Pathway enrichment analysis for the upregulated genes of
  Macrophage A cluster. Only the most significant differentially expressed genes (log2FC
  > 1 and Padj < 0.01) were chosen for pathway enrichment analysis. The graph shows
  the number of genes modulated in each single pathway, the fold enrichment, and the
  statistical significance. (E) Dot plot of the proangiogenic cytokines, with the
  identification of proangiogenic SPP1+ macrophages. Cell type classification the
  percentage and average expression of the specific cell markers are shown. (F) Feature
  plot of SPP1+ cell distribution is shown in F
