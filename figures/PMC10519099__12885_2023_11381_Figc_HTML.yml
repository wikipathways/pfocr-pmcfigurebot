caption: 'Mechanism of coagulation index in LSCC. Tumor cells invade the surrounding
  tissue of the primary tumor cells, enter the blood system and are transported to
  other organs to form metastases. The interaction between tumor cells and platelets
  allows them to migrate from the primary site to form metastasis, and platelets accumulate
  around cancer cells to protect them and form immune escape. Fib also promotes platelet
  aggregation and adhesion around tumor cells to protect them from immune cells. VEGF-A
  is secreted by tumor cells, indirectly promotes coagulation and changes the coagulation
  properties of endothelial cells. VEGF-A binds to Fib, promotes angiogenesis in cancer
  tissues and leads to cancer growth and metastasis. Platelets significantly increased
  with the stimulation of VEGF-A, ROS and IL-6. The combination of ROS and RNS and
  the combination of IL-6 and JAK induce DNA damage leading to genetic instability
  through the STAT-3 pathway, promote cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis.
  VEGF-A: vascular endothelial growth factor-A, Fib: fibrinogen, RNS: reactive nitrogen
  species, ROS: reactive oxygen species, LSCC: laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma,
  IL-6: interleukin-6, JAK: janus kinase, STAT-3: signal transducer and activator
  of transcription-3'
