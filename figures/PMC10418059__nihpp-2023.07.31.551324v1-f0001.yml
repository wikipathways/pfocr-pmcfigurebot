figure_title: CCT and the TORC1 pathway promote dendritic arborization
caption: (A) Schematic diagram of regulatory relationships between the insulin pathway,
  SCF complex, CCT, and TORC1 pathway with the insulin pathway indicated by teal arrows.
  TORC1 is negatively regulated by Cullin1 and positively regulated by CCT. The upstream
  insulin pathway in green is displayed for context but was not examined in this study.
  Individual components of the SCF and TORC1 complexes examined in this study are
  outlined in white. (B) Representative images of CIV neurons for key CCT and TORC1
  pathway manipulations, with RNAi-mediated knockdown indicated with -IR and UAS-mediated
  overexpression with -OE. Scale bars = 100 μm (C) Total dendritic length of CCT and
  TORC1 pathway manipulations shown in comparison to a WT control, * indicates a significant
  change from control (p < 0.05). (D) Number of Sholl intersections mapped by color
  at increasing radial distances from soma (μm). Significant changes in Sholl maximum
  intersections and radius are indicated by an asterisk. Arrows indicate genotypes
  where the radius of maximum intersections has shifted significantly from WT. The
  white dashed line is to reference the radius of maximum intersections for WT neurons.
  In all panels * = p < 0.05, see  for detailed statistics.
