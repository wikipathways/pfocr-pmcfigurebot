caption: The entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain via ACE2 pathway by activation of the
  cytokine storm. TLR or NF-κB signaling may activate the pro-inflammatory pathway
  after viral attachment and penetration into epithelial cells via ACE-2 receptor,
  followed by the development of an inflammasome. CCL-2, CCL-4, CXCL-10, and IL-6
  are among the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines generated as a result of
  this self-defense process. Immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, T cells,
  and neutrophils, are drawn to the infection site by these proteins. A pro-inflammatory
  feedback loop is created when T lymphocytes produce TNF- β, IL-6, IL-4, IL-12, and
  IL-23, increasing immune cell accumulation. CNS immune cells, astrocytes and microglia
  may be activated by these cytokines. IL-1, IL-6, TNF- α, and IL-8 are released as
  a result of the activated microglia and astrocytes. Several CNS disease-related
  illnesses are linked with elevated levels of these inflammatory cytokines. The figure
