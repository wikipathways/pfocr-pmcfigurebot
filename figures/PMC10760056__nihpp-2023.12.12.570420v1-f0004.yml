figure_title: miR153 and miR376c transcriptional repression are controlled by a common
  CaN-NFAT signaling pathway during iLTP
caption: (A) qRT-PCR of primary miR153 transcript (pri-miR153) and pri-miR410 (pri-Ctrl)
  expression in neurons harvested at increasing time-points following iLTP stimulation.
  pri-miRNA levels were normalized to U6 and quantified as fold change from Ctrl condition.
  n = 4.(B) qRT-PCR of mature miR153 and miR410 (Ctrl miRNA) expression in neurons
  harvested at increasing time-points following treatment with actinomycin-D (ActD).
  miRNA levels normalized to U6 and quantified as fold change from Ctrl condition.
  n = 4.(C) qRT-PCR of pri-miR153 expression in hippocampal neurons following control
  treatment (Ctrl) or 90 min post-iLTP stimulation in the presence or absence of CaN
  inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. Quantified as fold change in pri-miR153
  levels from Ctrl condition. n=4(D) qRT-PCR of mature miR153 expression in Ctrl and
  iLTP-90 neurons in the presence or absence of CsA and FK506. Quantified as miR153
  fold change from Ctrl condition. n=5(E) Schematic of the miR153-Luc luciferase reporters.
  Predicted NFAT binding site is mutated in miR153NFAT-Mut-Luc.(F) Quantification
  of miR153-Luc activities in neurons under control conditions (Ctrl) or 90 min post-iLTP
  stimulation. Firefly was normalized to Renilla, and the data quantified as relative
  change in normalized Luc activity with error-corrected control values. n = 4.(G)
  Quantification of miR153-Luc activities in Ctrl and iLTP-90 neurons in the presence
  or absence of CsA and FK506. n = 4.(H) Quantification of miR376c-Luc and miR153-Luc
  activities in Ctrl, NFATc3 knockdown (KD) and NFATc3 KD + rescue (Rescue) neurons.
  n = 7.(I) qPCR readout of acetyl-histone H3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
  from neurons to show acetylation status of the miR153 promoter in Ctrl and iLTP-90
  conditions in the presence or absence BAPTA-AM, CsA, and FK506. n = 4.(J) Quantification
  of miR153-Luc activities in Ctrl and iLTP-90 neurons in the presence or absence
  of CsA and FK506. Quantified as fold change in miR153-Luc activity from Ctrl condition.
  n = 4.(K) Quantification of Luc-Gabra1, Luc-Gabrg2, and Luc-Gphn activities in Ctrl
  and iLTP-90 neurons in the presence or absence of HDAC inhibitor trichostatin-A
  (TSA). n = 4.All values represent mean ± SEM. *p<0.05 and **p<0.01, ***p<0.005,
  ****p<0.0001; one-sample t-test (A-D,I), two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  post-hoc test (F,J), and Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons post-hoc
  test (G,H)
