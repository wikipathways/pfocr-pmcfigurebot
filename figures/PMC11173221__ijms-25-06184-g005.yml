  cells.
caption: 'Effects of Arg on expression of MyHC and mTOR signaling pathway in C2C12
  cells. Histomorphology of C2C12 cells. Scale bars represent 50 μm (A). (B,C) The
  enzyme activity of LDH (B), and SDH (C) in C2C12 cells. (D–F) The mRNA expression
  of MyoD, MyoG, Myomarker (D), MyHC I and MyHC IIB (E), PGC-1α, TFAM, MEF2C, and
  NRF1 (F) in C2C12 cells. The white column represents the group with 0.4 mM of Arg
  added, the red column represents the group with 1.2 mM of Arg added. The gray column
  represents the group with 3.6 mM of Arg added. (G,H) The protein expression of PGC-1α
  (G) and mTOR-p70S6K (H) in C2C12 cells. *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001.
