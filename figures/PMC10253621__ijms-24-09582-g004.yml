  F2 males.
caption: Modulation of the insulin signaling pathway in Chlorpyrifos (CPF)-exposed
  F2 males. (A,D) Representative Western blot of proteins prepared from 6-month F2
  liver probed with different antibodies against pIRTyr972 (B), p-IRS1Ser302 (C),
  p-AKTSer473 (E), and pGS3KSer9/21 (F). Data were normalized for b-actin protein.
  Western blots were quantified by densitometry, using Image Lab Software. Results
  were obtained from three independent experiments and expressed as mean and Â± SD.
  One-way ANOVA, * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 vs. CTRL
