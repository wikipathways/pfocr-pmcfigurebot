figure_title: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway mediates post-burn
  adipose tissue thermogenesis
caption: (A) Volcano plot highlighting differentially expressed proteins between sham
  and burn mice at 7 days post-burn. Red dots indicate significantly decreased proteins
  and blue dots indicate significantly increased proteins in burn mice, n = 3/group.(B)
  Relative protein abundance of acetylcholinesterase between sham and burn mice, n
  = 3/group.(C) Secreted acetylcholine concentration measured in culture medium with
  iWAT explants from sham or burn mice, n = 3–5/group.(D and E) mRNA expression of
  (D) Ucp1, n = 9/group, and (E) Chrna2, n = 9/group, in iWAT of sham or burn mice
  at 7 days post-burn, calculated as a fold change over sham controls.(F) Schematic
  of study design, whereby sham or burn (20% TBSA) mice were injected daily with either
  30 mg/kg of hexamethonium bromide (HexBr, HBr) or PBS for 7 days until euthanasia
  and tissue collection.(G) Change in body weight post-injection, n = 8–12/group.(H)
  Total food intake, n = 5/group.(I) Representative images of H&E staining in iWAT
  of burn + saline and burn + HBr mice. Scale bar, 100 μm.(J) mRNA expression of thermogenic,
  adrenergic, and insulin receptor signaling markers as a fold change over BSal mice
  in iWAT, n = 8–9/group.(K–M) Percentage frequency of CD45+ (K) B cells, (L) T cells,
  and (M) M2-like macrophages, n = 3–4/group.(N) Schematic of study design for chemical
  denervation followed by burn injury experiments.(O and P) (O) Quantified western
  blot protein expression of TH, ATGL, and UCP1 in iWAT of denervated and sham-denervated
  burn mice and (P) representative images, n = 3–7/group.(Q) Acetylcholine concentration
  in iWAT of denervated and sham-denervated burn mice, n = 4/group.(R) mRNA expression
  of iWAT Chrna2, n = 6–7/group. Data reported as the mean ± SEM. Significance was
  determined by two-tailed Student’s t test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001
