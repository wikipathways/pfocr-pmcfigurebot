caption: The Entner-Doudoroff pathway in M. buryatense 5GB1C. (a) Schematic representation
  of simplified central metabolism of M. buryatense 5GB1C in which F6P is the metabolic
  branch point connecting the RuMP cycle, the ED pathway, and the EMP pathway. In
  the ED pathway, Edd catalyzes dehydration of 6PG to form KDPG, and Eda catalyzes
  cleavage of KDPG to form GAP and PYR. M. buryatense 5GB1C uses pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent
  F6P 1-phosphotransferase to convert F6P to FBP instead of phosphofructokinase ().
  In addition, one PPi corresponds to one-third ATP (, ). Therefore, 3.67 ATP and
  2 NADH are generated via the EMP pathway, assuming one F6P molecule is completely
  oxidized to two pyruvate molecules. Through the ED pathway, 2 ATP, 1 NADH, and 1
  NADPH are generated per F6P molecule. (b) Genomic locus organization of edd-eda-gltA
  in the WT strain. 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate; edd, gene encoding
  6-phosphogluconate dehydratase; eda, gene encoding 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate
  aldolase; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; KDPG, 2-keto-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate; PPi, pyrophosphate;
  PYR, pyruvate.
