figure_title: RAC/CDC42 pathway inhibition decreases Dnmt3a loss–induced myeloid skewing
  and improves B cells and T cells in mice
caption: (A) BM cellularity quantitation for 2 femurs in each mouse from mice transplanted
  with Dnmt3a–/– cells and treated with the vehicle or MBQ-167. n = 5–6, mean ± SEM,
  *P = 0.05. (B) Flow cytometry analysis was performed on BM cells from mice transplanted
  with Dnmt3a–/– cells and treated with vehicle or MBQ-167. Quantitative data showing
  the absolute number of Lin–cKit+ myeloid progenitors, Lin–cKit+Sca-1+ (LSKs), CMPs,
  GMPs, and MEPs. n = 5–6, mean ± SEM, *P = 0.05. (C and D) Flow cytometry analysis
  was performed on BM cells from mice in A, and representative dot plots for CD150-
  and CD48-stained (LSK gated) HSCs as shown in F; quantitative data plotted for the
  frequency and absolute number of CD150–CD48+ cells is shown in G. n = 5–6, mean
  ± SEM, *P = 0.05. (E) Representative data showing the frequency of CLPs in BM cells
  from mice transplanted with Dnmt3a–/– cells and treated with vehicle or MBQ-167.
  n = 5–6, mean ± SEM, *P = 0.05. Flow cytometry was performed on BM cells from vehicle-
  or MBQ-167–treated mice as in Figure 10A, and a representative dot plot for Mac1/Gr1
  expression is shown in F and B220/CD3 cells in I. Quantitative data showing decreased
  Gr1+Mac1+ in BM and PB fractions (G); increased CD3+ T cells in BM and spleen fractions
  (H); increased B220+ B cells in BM, spleen, and in PB fractions (J); and increased
  B220hiCD19hi mature B cells in BM fractions (K) of drug-treated mice compared with
  controls. n = 5–6, mean ± SEM, *P = 0.05, **P = 0.005, unpaired t test (2-tailed)
  performed (B, D, E, G, H, J, and K)
