figure_title: CircRILPL1 promotes YAP nuclear translocation through mediating its
  binding to IPO7
caption: 'A The binding between circRILPL1 and IPO7 protein was detected in NPC cells
  by RNA pull-down with biotin-labeled circRILPL1 probe. GAPDH was used as a negative
  control. B The binding between circRILPL1 and IPO7 protein was examined in NPC cells
  using anti-IPO7 antibody by RIP assay. The fold enrichment of circRILPL1 is relative
  to that of the control IgG. C CircRILPL1 promotes the nuclear translocation of IPO7
  in NPC cells as examined by cytosolic/nuclear protein fractionation. PARP was used
  as a nuclear marker and β-tubulin as a cytoplasmic marker. D. Co-localization of
  YAP and IPO7 in NPC cells after overexpression of circRILPL1. DAPI: blue; YAP: red;
  IPO7: green; Scale bar = 10 μm. E The effect of circRILPL1 on the interaction between
  YAP and IPO7 was detected by immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag (IPO7) antibody,
  followed by western blotting using YAP antibody in NPC cells transfected with Flag-IPO7
  plasmid, co-transfected with circRILPL1 overexpression plasmid or empty vector.
  GAPDH was used as a negative control. F The transcriptional activity of YAP was
  measured by luciferase reporter assay after overexpression or knockdown of circRILPL1
  or IPO7 in NPC cells. G Knockdown of IPO7 blocked the nuclear import of YAP induced
  by circRILPL1 in NPC cells. PARP was used as a nuclear marker and β-tubulin as a
  cytoplasmic marker. H The effects of knockdown of IPO7 or ROCK1 on circRILPL1-induced
  YAP nuclear translocation in HNE2 cells. Data were presented as the means ± SD.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.'
