caption: 'Tools used to collect data (genes). (A) Bioinformatics approaches designed
  for the Data Source 1 collection. This project utilized three general axes: 1. AMD-related
  disease module identification; 2. AMD-related protein–protein interactions; 3. The
  anti-VEGF drug resistance signaling pathway. (B) The process of identifying pathogenic
  modules associated with AMD disease involves several steps. Through the combination
  of the results from two algorithms (MuST and DIAMOnD), a collection of genes associated
  with the AMD disease modules was identified (gene list 1 = 230 genes). (C) The process
  and databases utilized to identify the proteins associated with AMD disease were
  designed and employed to construct the AMD-related protein–protein interaction network
  (gene list 2 = 7061 genes). (D) The third set of genes (4340 genes) are involved
  in developing resistance to anti-VEGF drugs. They were identified by analyzing 89
  signaling pathways in the KEGG database and reviewing articles'
