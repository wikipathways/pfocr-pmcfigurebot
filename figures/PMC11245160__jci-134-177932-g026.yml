  (A and B) Immunoblots showing the expression of critical adapters in the IL-6/ STAT3 signaling pathway in WT and WTAPΔ1–77 THP-1 cells. (C) Flow cytometry showing IL6ST-FITC fluorescence in cell surface of peritoneal macrophages and BMDMs. (D) Immunoblots showing the expression of WTAP and IL6ST in the lung or colon tissues from Wtapfl/fl and LyzM-cre+
  WtapΔ1–77 mice that were intraperitoneally injected with LPS for 12 hours. (E) Immunoblots showing the levels of phosphorylated STAT3, p65, and p38 in WT and IL6ST–/– THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS at the indicated time points. (F) ELISAs detecting IL-6 secretion in the supernatants of WT and IL6ST–/– THP-1 cells stimulated with indicated inflammatory stimuli. (G) Schematic representation showing the position of m6A motifs within the IL6ST transcripts. F1/R1 represents detection site 1 and F2/R2 represents detection site 2. (H) MeRIP-qPCR showing the abundance of IL6ST transcripts in WT and WTAPΔ1–77 THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS for 6 hours. (I) WT or mutant (Mut) m6A consensus sequences (A–T mutation) on the IL6ST-3′ UTR were fused with the Renilla luciferase reporter in the psiCHECK-2 vector. (J and K) Relative luciferase activities in 293T cells after transfection with indicated reporter vectors. (L) qRT–PCR showing the proportion of IL6ST mRNA in polysome fractions from WT and WTAPΔ1–77 THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS for 6 hours. (M) Schematic representation of the biotin-labeled probes of IL6ST transcripts. (N) RNA pull-down analyses showing the interaction between different IL6ST RNA probes and the YTHDF1/3 protein. (O) RIP-qPCR showing the interaction between IL6ST mRNA and YTHDF1/3 in WT and WTAPΔ1–77 THP-1 cells. (P) Immunoblot analyses showing the abundance of IL18Rα and IL15Rα in WT and WTAPΔ1–77 THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS at the indicated time points. (Q) Relative luciferase activities in 293T cells after transfection with indicated reporter vectors. Data are representative of 3 independent biological experiments in A–E, N, and P. Data are presented as the mean ± SD in F, H, J–L, O, and Q, with individual measurements overlaid as dots. Statistical analysis was performed using 1-way ANOVA multiple comparisons in F, H, J, O, and Q, or 2-tailed Student’s t test in K
