figure_title: The patient variant p.Arg836Gln disrupts numerous signalling pathways
  and leads to reduced SART3 RNA and protein levels
caption: RNA-seq and MS analysis of heterozygous, homozygous p.Arg836Gln variant or
  non-edited control iPSCs. a A Venn diagram of differentially expressed (DE) genes
  between groups (FDR < 0.05). b Number of DE genes is shown in blue for each comparison
  KEGG and Gene Ontology (biological process) pathway analysis identified 13 pathways/gene
  ontologies with significant enrichment (P < 0.05 adjusted for multiple comparisons,
  Benjamini Hochberg FDR) represented in the topmost DE genes between control and
  homozygous iPSCs (1000 genes based on FDR). c A schematic of the major spliceosome.
  SART3 (red) has been implicated in recycling U4 and U6 snRNAs. Components that are
  DE in variant iPSCs are shown (RNA-seq or MS. Bold text = both with change in same
  direction). d Intersection of the DE genes (FDR < 0.05) and proteins (FDR < 0.05)
  revealed a significant overlap (P < 10−9, one-sided Fischer’s Exact Test) with 350
  genes/proteins DE in the same direction in both datasets (plotted as log2 ratio/fold
  change). Genes/proteins with the highest upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue)
  are shown. SART3 is downregulated in the homozygous variant cells (green). e SART3
  expression from RNA-seq (mean log2 counts per million, CPM) *** = FDR = 1.52E-05
  and 1.45E-04 respectively. Downregulation was confirmed by RT-qPCR – see Supplementary
  Fig. . f MS found a significant difference in SART3 protein levels in homozygous
  iPSC line compared to control (***P = 3.77E-05), or heterozygous line (***P = 1.11E-04).
  g This was confirmed in western blot analysis – see also Supplementary Fig. . h
  SART3 staining is nuclear in all three lines. RNA-seq and proteomic data analysis
  is provided in Supplementary Data .
