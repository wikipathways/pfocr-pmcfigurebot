figure_title: Anti-inflammatory mechanism of MBPs.
caption: Anti-inflammatory mechanism of MBPs. Pathway 1 is Cordyceps militaris peptide
  regulating the PI3K-Akt and TNF signalling pathways to release Leukotriens and 5-hydroxy
  tryptamine. Pathway 2 is Flammulina velutipes peptide and Tricholoma matsutake peptide
  acting on lymphocytes, which in turn regulate NF-κB, P-85, P-AKT, P-IKKe, NLRP 3
  and caspase-1. Pathway 3 is Hericium erinaceus peptide acting on macrophages to
  release NO, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α
