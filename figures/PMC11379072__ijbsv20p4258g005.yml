caption: Hydroxytyrosol (HT) increased antioxidant capacity and alleviated oxidative
  stress through the PI3K/Akt-Nrf2 signaling pathway. (A) Protein expression and quantitation
  of Akt, p-Akt, PI3K, and p-PI3K were determined by western blotting in the intestinal
  mucosa of piglets. (B) Protein expression and quantitation of Akt, p-Akt, PI3K,
  and p-PI3K were determined by western blotting in IPEC-J2 cells. (C) The schematic
  diagram illustrates drug administration in IPEC-J2 cells. LY294002, PI3K/Akt pathway
  inhibitor. (D) The cell viability of IPEC-J2 cells treated with LY294002 was determined
  by CCK-8 assay. (E) Protein expression and quantitation of Akt, p-Akt, PI3K, and
  p-PI3K in IPEC-J2 cells treated with LY294002 were determined by western blotting.
  (F) The cell viability of IPEC-J2 cells was determined by CCK-8 assay in the PI3K/Akt
  pathway inhibition experiment. (G) Protein expression and quantitation of Akt, p-Akt,
  PI3K, p-PI3K, Keap1, Nrf2, p-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were determined by western blotting
  in PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition experiment. (H) The levels of catalase (CAT), glutathione
  peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were
  determined by biochemical assay kits. (I) The relative content and (J) staining
  of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by ROS Assay Kit. (K)
  Western blotting determined the protein expression and quantitation of ZO-1, Occludin,
  and Claudin-1. (L) Representative immunofluorescence images of Claudin-1. Values
  are means Â± SE. Different letters and * represent significant differences (P < 0.05)
