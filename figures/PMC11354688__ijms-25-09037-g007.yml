caption: The PI3K-AKT cell signaling pathway of insulin and glucose utilization, which
  is one of the most significant intracellular signaling cascades involving phosphorylation
  of mediators (a). The muscle (b), liver (c) and adipose tissue (d) are the three
  main target organs of insulin action. Insulin enhances protein synthesis via the
  mTORC1 pathway, which facilitates muscle growth and repair (b). Once the PI3K-AKT
  pathway is triggered, it leads to the activation of glycogen synthase and in turn
  the formation of glycogen in hepatocytes. Concomitantly, insulin suppresses lipolysis
  and encourages fatty acid synthesis (c). Insulin can also enhance lipid storage,
  known as de novo lipogenesis—through mechanisms such as upregulation of the activity
  of lipogenic enzymes like fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase and the
  inhibition of the breakdown of triglycerides. The arrows in the flow chart are used
  to describe the directions of the chemical reactions in the signaling pathway. The
  ↑ and ↓ arrow symbols, displayed next to glycogen synthase, lipogenic enzymes and
  lipolysis refer to an increase in glycogen synthase and lipogenic enzymes, as well
  as decrease in lipolysis, respectively
