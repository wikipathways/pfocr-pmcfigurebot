caption: 'Roles of Zn and Cu in the synapse under physiological and pathophysiological
  conditions: (A) Roles of Zn and Cu under normal physiological conditions. Zn and
  Cu are secreted from presynaptic vesicles to the synaptic clefts with glutamate
  during neuronal firing. Secreted Zn binds to N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-type glutamate
  receptors (NMDA-R) and amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainite
  type glutamate receptors (A/K-R) and inhibits their functions. Zn enhances the expression
  of the zinc transporter ZnT-1 or the translocation of ZnT-1 to synaptic membranes.
  Thereafter, ZnT-1 binds to NMDA-R and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (L-VGCC)
  to regulate overall brain excitability and maintain Ca homeostasis. Secreted Cu
  regulates NMDA-R and A/K-R by binding with normal cellular prion protein (PrPC).
  PrPC also regulates Zn2+ influx by binding with A/K-R. Secreted Zn and Cu spill
  over to neighboring synapses and inhibit or potentiate neuronal excitability in
  a biphasic dose-dependent manner. Finally, Zn and Cu contribute to information processing
  and memory formation. ZIP-4 can reuptake secreted Zn, and CTR1 can reuptake Cu once
  it has been reduced to Cu+ by amyloid precursor protein (APP). The subtle balance
  of Zn, Cu, and Ca maintains synaptic functions. (B) Roles of Zn and Cu under pathophysiological
  conditions. In transient global ischemia conditions, widespread, prolonged excitation
  occurs in the brain, and excess Zn and Cu can be secreted to synaptic clefts with
  glutamate. Secreted excess Zn causes the acute reduction of the GluR2 subunit of
  A/K-R, and Ca2+-permeable A/K-R (Ca-A/K-R) appears. Both Ca2+ and Zn2+ are intracellularly
  translocated via Ca-A/K-R, NMDA-R, and L-VGCC. Increased intracellular Ca2+ levels
  ([Ca2+]i) and intracellular Zn2+ levels ([Zn2+]i) then cause various neurodegenerative
  pathways, ultimately triggering the pathogenesis of vascular-type senile dementia.
