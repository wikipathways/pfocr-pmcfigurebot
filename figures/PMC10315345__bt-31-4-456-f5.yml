caption: LKB1 inhibited cervical tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo.
  (A) Tumor growth was significantly repressed by LKB1 intraperitoneal injection as
  shown in the curve graph. Tumor size was measured every 3 d; *p<0.05; **p<0.01 compared
  with the control groups. (B) The tumors excised from control and LKB1-treated mice
  on treatment day 30 were photographed (upper panel). Tumor weights are reported
  as the means of three mouse tumors (n=5 per group) (lower left panel) ± SDs; *p<0.05
  versus control groups. Sections of LKB1-treated and control tumors were stained
  with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; lower right panel). Bars=20 µm. (C) Immunohistochemical
  (IHC) staining for the cell proliferation markers PCNA and Ki-67. PCNA and Ki-67
  expression were repressed in LKB1-treated groups compared to control groups. Bar=20
  µm; *p<0.05 vs control groups. (D) Endothelial cells in paraffin-embedded tumor
  sections were stained using anti-CD31 antibodies. LKB1-treated tumors showed an
  ~four-fold decrease in CD31 staining. Bar=50 μm; *p<0.05 vs. control groups. (E)
  LKB1 decreased the expression levels of VEGF and HIF-1α protein and the phosphorylation
  of VEGFR-2, as evaluated by WB analysis of tumor samples. (F) LKB1 downregulated
  the phosphorylation of major mediators of the VEGFR-2/mTOR signaling pathway. Whole
  cell lysates were processed and visualized by WB analysis using anti-phospho-PI3K,
  phospho-PDK1, phospho-Akt, and phospho-mTOR antibodies
