caption: Association of p53 pathway and apoptotic genes with liver fibrosis. (A) GSEA
  plots displaying the upregulation of genes associated with the ‘P53 transcriptional
  gene network’ in liver tissues of the DMN group (n = 1) compared to the normal group
  (n = 1) and their downregulation in the oligonol-treated DMN group compared with
  the DMN group (n = 1). (B) A gene network representing gene–gene interaction associated
  with p53-related apoptotic genes in the burn-wound-healing pathway. Genes involved
  in both apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway are colored green. DMN, dimethylnitrosamine;
  NESs, normalized enrichment scores
