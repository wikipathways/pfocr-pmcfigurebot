caption: Examples of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) involvement in the regulation of various
  signaling pathways. OGT catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc to nuclear factor kappa
  B (NF-ÎºB), which enhances its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity.
  OGT also adds O-GlcNAc to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol
  II), which competes with phosphorylation at the same sites and can switch Pol II
  between the pre-initiation and the elongation states
