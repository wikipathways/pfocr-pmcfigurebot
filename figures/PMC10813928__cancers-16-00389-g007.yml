caption: Diagram showing the putative regulatory role of GalCer in regulation of TNFRSF1B,
  TNFRSF9, and BCL2 gene expression that results in resistance of BC cells to apoptosis
  (Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 1 February 2023)). As hypothesized, GalCer
  modulates the activities of a signaling pathway/pathways which leads to decreased
  expression of P53. Depending on the cellular context, P53, acting as a transcription
  factor, upregulates expression of the BCL2 gene and downregulates the expression
  of TNFRSF1B and TNFRSF9 genes at the transcriptional level, or P53 acts as an mRNA-binding
  protein (RBP) and upregulates expression of Bcl-2 protein at the post-translational
  level. ↑—upregulation, ↓—downregulation, ?—unknown signaling pathway
