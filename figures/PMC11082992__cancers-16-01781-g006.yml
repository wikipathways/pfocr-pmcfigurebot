caption: Protein-protein interactions were examined using the STRING database for
  this gene set. (A) The outcome strongly correlates with these proteins and has higher
  co-expression patterns. Additionally, the impact of these signaling pathway gene
  expressions on the prognosis of patients with serous carcinoma was investigated.
  (Bâ€“E) Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots were used to analyze the overall survival (OS) probability
  in these patients. In patients with serous subtypes, the OS plots of the YAP1 gene
  and Hippo gene set expressions show a poor survival pattern when highly expressed
  conditions, while MST1 and MST2 gene expressions do not affect survival. The log-rank
  test determined the significant p-values (p < 0.05)
