figure_title: Upregulated desmin/integrin β1/MAPK axis promotes elastic cartilage
  regeneration with increased ECM mechanical strength
caption: The schematic graph demonstrates that chondrocytes with high desmin expression
  showed a stronger interaction with ECM through integrin β1 and enhanced chondrogenesis
  capability with the activated MAPK signaling pathway
