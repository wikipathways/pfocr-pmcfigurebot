caption: Metabolic pathway analysis based on the enrichment analysis procedure for
  metabolites found in the metabolome of HCT-116 cells after exposure to BLEGI. The
  most relevant biosynthesis pathways are represented according to p-value < 0.05
  and pathway impact (pi) > 0. (1) Glutathione metabolism (p-value = 0.022, pi = 0.282),
  (2) tricarboxylic acid cycle (p-value = 0.010, pi = 0.148), (3) lipoic acid metabolism
  (p-value = 0.021, pi = 0.096), and (4) pyrimidine metabolism (p-value = 0.039, pi
  = 0.053). Summary pathways biosynthesis identified in endo- and exometabolome generated
  with MetaboAnalyst 6.0 based on differential metabolites
