figure_title: Midazolam exposure leads to aberrant activation of the mTOR signaling
  pathway in the mouse dentate gyrus.
caption: Midazolam exposure leads to aberrant activation of the mTOR signaling pathway
  in the mouse dentate gyrus. (A). Schematic representation of the experimental timeline
  for immunohistochemistry. (B,C). Representative confocal images of phospho-S6 and
  phospho-mTOR expression in exposed dentate gyrus neurons at P63 (scale bar = 100
  μm). The upper rows represent the magnified confocal images, and the white arrows
  point at the qualified positive cells (scale bar = 30 μm). (D,E). Downstream markers
  of the mTOR pathway, phospho-mTOR and phospho-S6 expression increased after midazolam
  exposure, and using the inhibitor of mTOR pathway can prevent this increase. M20
  indicates midazolam 20 mg/kg dose administered in deep sedation paradigm using validated
  rating scale. V indicates rapamycin control vehicle (n = 12–17 per group. *** p
  < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, ANOVA, n.s. indicates no significant difference compared
  to the control group)
