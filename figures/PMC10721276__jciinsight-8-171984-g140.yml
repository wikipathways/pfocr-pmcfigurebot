figure_title: Resting and differentiating Aga2+/– chondrocyte differential expression
  indicates accelerated differentiation
caption: (A) Violin plots showing increased Sox9 and Col2a1 as well as decreased Mgp
  expression in resting and differentiating chondrocytes. * = P < 0.05. (B) Top relevant
  enriched KEGG pathway analysis terms between WT and Aga2+/– in resting and differentiating
  chondrocytes. (C) Illustration showing the multiple pathways influencing Sox9 expression.
  (D) Heatmap showing differential expression of signaling pathway components important
  in chondrocyte differentiation. (E) Heatmap showing differential expression of additional
  cell cycle and cartilage markers. NS spaces represent differential expression values
  that were not significant
