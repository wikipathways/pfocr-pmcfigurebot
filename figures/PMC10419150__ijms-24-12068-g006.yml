figure_title: Exosomes from retinal organoids (Exo-ROs) contain microRNAs (miRNAs)
  mainly involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.
caption: Exosomes from retinal organoids (Exo-ROs) contain microRNAs (miRNAs) mainly
  involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. (A) The
  20 most abundant miRNAs in Exo-ROs with more than 1000 counts per million (cpm).
  (B) Gene ontology and (C) pathway enrichment of the 293 genes are predicted as shared
  targets of 10 or more miRNAs among the 20 most abundant miRNAs. (D) Extraction of
  actual target genes by comparison of predicted target genes and differentially expressed
  genes in Exo-RO-treated the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats. Of the 4929 human
  target genes, 4674 rat orthologs are identified. Among them, 301 genes are significantly
  downregulated in Exo-RO-treated eyes relative to those in vesicle-treated eyes (p
  < 0.05, logFC < 0). (E) The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis
  shows that the 301 genes are mainly involved in the MAPK signaling pathway (61.22%).
  (F) Significantly downregulated genes of MAPK pathway, which are targeted by top-20
  abundant miRNAs in Exo-ROs (cpm > 1000), in retina of Exo-ROs-treated RCS rat (false
  discovery rate (q-value) < 0.05)
