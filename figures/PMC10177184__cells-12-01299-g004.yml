figure_title: Rank pairwise correlation between 11 gene evolutionary rate metrics
  related to NPII and pathway dN/dS.
caption: 'Rank pairwise correlation between 11 gene evolutionary rate metrics related
  to NPII and pathway dN/dS. (A) upper matrix triangle and main diagonal are colored
  by rank correlation value, and asterisks denote p-value: *** for p < 0.001. Lower
  matrix triangle contains rank correlation coefficients in numeric format. The clustering
  method is Ward.D2 [43] (B) rank correlation between dN/dS and the aggregated NGRE
  metric for individual genes. Top and bottom 0.2 quantiles are colored to show groups
  with high and/or low evolutionary metrics, accordingly. (C) rank correlation between
  dN/dS and the aggregated NPII metric for molecular pathways. Top and bottom 0.2
  quantiles are colored to show groups with high and/or low evolutionary metrics accordingly'
