caption: The effects on PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway in HK-2 cells induced by uric acid
  (720 μM). HK-2 cells were treated with pCDNA-PAR2 and siPAR2. (a) RT–PCR examined
  the expression of PAR2, PI3K, AKT, and NF-κB genes. (b) Western blotting determined
  the expression of PAR2, PI3K, AKT, and NF-κB proteins. (c) Quantitative values of
  the relative expression levels of PAR2, PI3K, AKT, and NF-κB. (d) The levels of
  pro-IL-1β, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α, and TGF-β in the cell culture supernatant
  were determined by ELISA assay. Data are presented as means ± standard deviation.
