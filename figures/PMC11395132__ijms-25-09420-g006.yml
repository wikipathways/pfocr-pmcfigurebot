figure_title: Effect of HAMSB on the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant signaling pathway.
caption: Effect of HAMSB on the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant signaling pathway. (A,B)
  Interaction of butyrate and Keap-1 at the active domain. The predicted 3D (A) and
  2D (B) binding mode of butyrate with Keap-1. (C) Representative image of western
  blot analysis and (D) quantification of nuclear Nrf2, GCLM, HO-1 and NQO-1 protein
  expression in the liver. (E) The mRNA expression of GCLM, HO-1, NQO-1 in the liver.
  Values of these genes from qRT-PCR analysis are normalized to the expression of
  GAPDH. Data are presented as mean Â± SEM. (#) p < 0.05 and (##) p < 0.01 versus Control
  group; (*) p < 0.05 and (**) p < 0.01 versus EtOH group
