  pathway in a metabolically engineered S.
caption: Implementation of RIM15 deletion and activation of the pyruvate-consuming
  pathway in a metabolically engineered S. cerevisiae strain producing 2,3-butanediol
  (2,3-BDO). All strains were constructed from the YHI030 strain developed by [13].
  (a) The metabolic pathway engineered in this study. (b) Effect of the RIM15 deletion
  on 2,3-BDO production. The 2,3-BDO concentrations in the flask-scale culture were
  determined at 72 h. (c–e) Specific growth rate (c), specific 2,3-BDO production
  rate (d), and 2,3-BDO yield (e) of metabolically engineered strains in the test
  tube-scale culture. Specific rates were determined from 24–72 h data. (f,g) Culture
  profiles of engineered strains in the test tube-scale culture. Culture profiles
  of YMS106 (f) and YMS106 (g) are shown. The data are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation of three independent transformants (n = 3 each). Asterisks indicate the
  results of the two-sided t-test (p < 0.05, n = 3)
