figure_title: Activation of the Hh/GLI signaling pathway.
caption: 'Activation of the Hh/GLI signaling pathway. Left panel: In the absence of
  ligand binding, PTCH exerts repressive effects on SMO. GLI transcription factors
  are sequestered by SUFU and phosphorylated by PKA, CK1, and GSK3β, marking them
  for proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage of the C-terminal domain creates GLIr, the
  repressor form of the transcription factor. GLIr then translocates into the nucleus
  and represses the transcription of Hh/GLI target genes. Right panel: Hh ligand binding
  to the extracellular domain of PTCH inhibits the receptor, relieving the repressive
  effects on SMO. SMO then inhibits the sequestration by SUFU and phosphorylation
  by PKA, CK1, and GSK3β, sparing GLI from proteolytic cleavage. The fulllength form
  of GLI is a transcriptional activator that translocates into the nucleus and promotes
  the transcription of Hh/GLI target genes such as PTCH1, GLI1, BCL2, Cyclin D1, etc.
