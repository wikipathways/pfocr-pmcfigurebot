caption: The formation approaches of Fusarium mycotoxins. (A) Mycotoxin biosynthetic
  genes and gene clusters in Fusarium. Arrows denote the location and transcriptional
  orientation of genes, while the corresponding gene name is provided adjacent to
  each arrow. (B) The proposed pathway of TRI biosynthesis. The 3,4,15‐triacetoxyscirpenol
  is an important branching point. One path leads to a Type A TRI, and the other leads
  to a Type B TRI. In F. sporotrichioides, FsRI1 exclusively catalyzes hydroxylation
  of 3,4,15‐triacetoxyscirpenol at C‐8, resulting in Type A TRIs, while in F. graminearum,
  FgTRI1 mediates hydroxylation of 3,4,15‐triacetoxyscirpenol at both C‐7 and C‐8,
  resulting in Type B TRIs. Dashed arrows denote steps where gene assignment has not
  been established. (C) The proposed pathway of FUM biosynthesis. Fum11p, a tricarboxylate
  transporter, transports tricarboxylic acid precursors out of the inner mitochondrial
  lumen for FUM biosynthesis, while Fum7p and Fum10p catalyze the conversion of tricarboxylic
  acid precursors into acetyl CoA‐activated tricarballylic acid. This product is then
  esterified to the polyketide backbone at C‐14 and C‐15 by Fum14p to produce either
  FB3 or FB4. Finally, the hydroxylation of FB3 and FB4 by Fum3p yields FB1 and FB2,
  respectively. (D) The proposed pathway of ZEA biosynthesis. The biosynthesis begins
  with PKS4, which facilitates the condensation of carbons derived from one acetyl‐CoA
  and five malonyl‐CoAs. PKS13 completes the polyketide backbone as an extender unit
  and is responsible for cyclization and aromatization. As the final step, β‐ZEL is
  converted into ZEA by ZEB1. (E) The formation pattern of metabolites of ZEA. The
  C6 keto group of ZEA is reduced to yield α‐ZEL and β‐ZEL, followed by a subsequent
  reduction at the C11–C12 double bond that results in the formation of α‐ZAL and
  β‐ZAL, respectively. Those proposed biosynthesis and metabolites pathways were derived
  from the works of McCormick et al., Alexander et al, Nahle et al and EFSA Panel
  on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) et al. CAL, calonectrin; FgTRI1, F. graminearum
  TRI1; FsTRI1, F. sporotrichioides TRI1; FUM, fumonisin; PKS, polyketide synthase;
  SAM, S‐adenosyl methionine; TRI, trichothecenes; ZEA, zearalenone.
