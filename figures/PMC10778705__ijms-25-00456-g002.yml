figure_title: TLR2-mediated protumoral mechanisms.
caption: TLR2-mediated protumoral mechanisms. Cancer cells actively or passively release
  DAMPs, especially following cell death induced by chemo- or radiotherapy. In addition,
  alterations in the microbiota due to antibiotic therapies, chemotherapies, or other
  factors can foster the proliferation of bacterial species that exert protumoral
  activity, releasing PAMPs in the TME. These endogenous and exogenous TLR2 ligands
  activate its signaling, promoting tumor progression in a cancer cell-intrinsic manner
  (on the left). TLR2 signaling activates NF-κB, which subsequently transcribes protumoral
  cytokines such as IL-6, TGF-β and VEGF. This stimulates cancer cell survival, angiogenesis
  and resistance to therapies. Additionally, TLR2 triggers the MAPK pathway, inducing
  EMT and promoting metastasis. Moreover, TLR2 is expressed by immune cells, where
  it exerts immunosuppressive effects favoring tumor progression in a cancer cell-extrinsic
  manner (on the right). TLR2 induces the differentiation of T and B regulatory cells,
  as well as of MDSCs from bone marrow precursors. MDSCs contribute to immunosuppression
  through several mechanisms, including the reprogramming of macrophages into the
  M2 phenotype. These processes collectively result in the production of cytokines
  that inhibit CD8+ T cells and their activity, promoting tumor immune evasion. Created
