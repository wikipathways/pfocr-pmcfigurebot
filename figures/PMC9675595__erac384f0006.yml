caption: The role of organelles in salicylic acid signaling. Overview of salicylic
  acid (SA) synthesis via the isochorismate synthase (ICS) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase
  (PAL) pathways starting from chorismate. ICS converts chorismate into isochorismate
  (IC) in plastids. EDS5 exports IC from the plastid into the cytosol where PBS3 converts
  it into isochorismoyl-9-glutamate and further into SA by EPS1. The PAL pathway converts
  chorismate into prephenate by CM1 or CM2. Prephenate is converted into arogenate
  by PPA-AT and further to tyrosine by ADH or phenylalanine by ADT. CM1, ADH, and
  ADT are negatively regulated by their corresponding amino acid products. Tyrosine
  and phenylalanine are transported into the cytosol where PPY-AT converts them to
  phenylalanine. Phenylalanine produced from both plastidal and cytosolic pathways
  is further converted into trans-cinnamic acid by PAL and then into SA via ortho-coumaric
  intermediate or benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. SA can be converted into functional
  or non-functional metabolites such as SA-2-sulfonate, SA-Asp and MeSA, or can be
  stored in the vacuole as SAG, SGE, 2,3-DHBX, 2,3-DHBG, 2,5-DHBX and 2,5-DHBG. Higher
  SA levels induce monomerization of NPR1, translocation into the nucleus and NPR1-dependent
  gene expression through direct interactions with TGA transcription factors. The
