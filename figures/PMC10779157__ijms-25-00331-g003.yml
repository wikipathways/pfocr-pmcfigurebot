figure_title: SHP-1-mediated inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
caption: SHP-1-mediated inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Several growth
  factors and cytokines activate their associated receptors, which, in turn, activate
  JAK. Activated JAK then activates STAT through phosphorylation and moves the activated
  STAT (p-STAT) to the nucleus, upregulating the expression of STAT-related genes.
  SHP-1 directly dephosphorylates STAT3 or its upstream JAKs, thereby inhibiting cell
  proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. EPO—erythropoietin; EPOR—erythropoietin
  receptor; TYK2—tyrosine kinase 2
