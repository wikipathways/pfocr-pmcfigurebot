figure_title: Regulatory analysis of BMDC from early-life RSV-infected female mice
  reveals enhancement of type-I IFN transcription factor signaling pathways.
caption: Regulatory analysis of BMDC from early-life RSV-infected female mice reveals
  enhancement of type-I IFN transcription factor signaling pathways. BMDC grown from
  neonatal male and female BALB/c mice were infected neonatally with RSV at 7 days
  of age were grown from 4-week post-infection mice and assessed by assay for Transposase-Accessible
  Chromatin using sequencing evaluation or messenger RNA gene expression. Age/Sex-matched
  naïve male or female mice were used as controls. N = 4–6 mice/group. (A) Bioinformatics
  array research tool analysis to determine transcription factors likely to bind to
  naïve BMDC DAR predicted genes. (B) Bioinformatics array research tool analysis
  to determine transcription factors likely to bind to EL-RSV BMDC DAR predicted genes.
  (C) Selected assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing EL-RSV
  BMDC DAR chromatin landscape plots for Irf1, Jun, Stat1, and Stat2 transcription
  factors. (D) Selected DAR chromatin landscape quantification for the altered transcription
  factors. (E) Percentage of genes within EL-RSV BMDC DAR annotations that are targets
  of STAT1/2, JUN, and IRF1. (F) Baseline transcription factor expression in male
  and female-derived BMDC 4 weeks post-RSV infection by quantitative polymerase chain
  reaction analysis for gene expression. (G) RSV infection-induced transcription factor
  expression in male and female-derived BMDC 4 weeks post-RSV infection by quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction analysis for gene expression. Data represent mean ± standard
  error of mean. Unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test used for statistical analysis;
  ** = p < 0.01; *** = p < 0.001; **** = p < 0.0001. BMDC = bone marrow-derived dendritic
  cell; DAR = differentially accessible region; EL = early-life; IFN = interferon;
  IL = interleukin; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus; Stat = Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription ; wpi =weeks post infection
