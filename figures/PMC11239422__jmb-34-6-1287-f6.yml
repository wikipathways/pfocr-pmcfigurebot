figure_title: Effects of the BG on the metabolic function of intestinal flora in UC
  mice
caption: (A) Relative abundance of KEGG signaling pathway functional gene expression
  in each group. (B) Metabolic pathways showed significant differences in functional
  gene expression abundance in the UC group vs. the SDFL group. (C) Metabolic pathways
  showed significant differences in functional gene expression abundance in the UC
  group vs. the SDFH group. (D) Spearman correlation analysis between metabolic pathways
  and indicators of enteritis. (UC means DSS, SDFL means BGL, SDFH means BGH)
