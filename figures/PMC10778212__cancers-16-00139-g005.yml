figure_title: CARM1 regulates the expression of PRKACA in bladder cancer (BC).
caption: CARM1 regulates the expression of PRKACA in bladder cancer (BC). (A,B) J82
  cells were transfected with LV−Con or LV−oeCARM1, or T24 cells were transfected
  with LV−shCon or LV−shCARM1, and RT–qPCR was used to examine the expression of the
  indicated pathway genes. (C,D) Western blotting was used to detect the PRKACA protein
  levels in J82 cells transfected with LV−Con or LV−oeCARM1. (E,F) T24 cells were
  transfected with LV−shCon or LV−shCARM1, and PRKACA protein expression was assessed
  via western blotting. (G,H) RT−qPCR and Western blot were used to explain PRKACA
  mRNA and protein expression in the clinical tissues. (I) Correlation analysis of
  PRKACA and CARM1 in bladder tissues (R = 0.355, p = 0.0203). (J) The Kaplan–Meier
  method was used to analyze the relationship between PRKACA expression and overall
  survival in patients with BC. (K,L), T24 and J82 cells were transfected with the
  indicated lentiviruses, and the CCK−8 assay was used to evaluate the cell viability.
  (M,N) T24 cells were transfected with LV−oeCARM1 or LV−shPRKACA alone or in combination,
  and a colony formation assay was performed to evaluate cell growth. All data were
  derived from three independent experiments and expressed as the mean ± standard
  error of the mean (SEM). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. their corresponding
  controls
