caption: 'UGT2B17 expression level influences proximal BCR signaling effectors. (A)
  Pathway enrichment analysis with the 683 genes commonly and significantly changed
  in MEC1 and JVM2 leukemic models overexpressing UGT2B17. Pos: positive; Neg: negative;
  Reg: regulation; IFNγ: interferon gamma; BCR: B-cell receptor; TCR: T-cell receptor;
  and TF: transcription factor. (B) Pearson correlations of UGT2B17 expression with
  genes related to BCR signaling pathway in two large CLL cohorts. For each cohort,
  genes were ranked from most positively correlated to most negatively correlated.
  (C) Expression of proximal BCR signaling effectors is enhanced in UGT2B17OE leukemic
  cell models. (D) pBTK is higher in UGT2B17HI CLL patients, revealed by WB. LO, HI:
  patients’ cells with low or high UGT2B17 expression levels assessed by RT-qPCR as
  specified in Methods. *, p ≤ 0.05'
