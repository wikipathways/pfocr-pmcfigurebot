caption: 'Metabolic remolding is influenced by genetic instability in PDAC. (A) Genetic
  mutations: PDAC is affected by high frequencies of aberrations and mutations in
  KRAS, P16/CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4. KRAS is involved in the RAF/mitogen-associated
  protein kinase pathway and the phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. P16/CDKN2
  mediates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. TP53 influences the transforming growth factor-beta
  (TGF-β)/Smad4 pathway. (B) Mutated forms of KRAS, TP53, P16/CDKN2, and SMAD4 promote
  glucose (Glc) uptake and enhance glycolytic flux, including the production of lactate
  (Lac). KRAS and TP53 can both reprogram glutamine (Gln) metabolism to balance cellular
  redox homeostasis. Pancreatic cancer induces metabolic shifts, including increased
  glycolysis, lipogenesis, glutaminolysis, and autophagy, which are related to cachexia.'
