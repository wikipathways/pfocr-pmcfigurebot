caption: Metabolic plasticity of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC).
  Glucose entering cells is converted to pyruvate which enters the inner mitochondrial
  matrix. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) oxidizes the pyruvate to acetyl
  CoA. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle begins when oxaloacetate combines with acetyl
  CoA to form citrate which is converted to isocitrate (by aconitase) and then to
  α-ketoglutarate (KG) by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). KGDHC oxidizes KG to produce
  succinyl CoA which is converted to succinate by succinyl CoA synthetase. Succinate
  is converted to fumarate (by succinate dehydrogenase, SDH) then to malate (by fumarase,
  fum) and finally to oxaloacetate (by malate dehydrogenase, MDH). KGDHC is rate limiting
  so if it is inhibited, the oxidative pathway is impaired. The inhibition of KGDHC
  creates a blockage in the TCA cycle, forcing the reductive pathway to occur, which
  leads to higher amounts of citrate. This citrate is exported out of the mitochondria
  into the cytosol where it is used for fatty acid synthesis which is necessary for
  cell proliferation and growth. KG is also produced from glutaminolysis which can
  enter either the reductive or oxidative pathways of the TCA cycle depending on the
  activation of KGDHC.
