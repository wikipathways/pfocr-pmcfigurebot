  of the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway.
caption: A PKA inhibitor (H89) abrogated icariin-induced osteogenesis via blockade
  of the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. (A) The protein expression levels of p-PKA,
  p-CREB, total PKA and total CREB in the control group, icariin group, H89 group
  and icariin+H89 group. (B) The mRNA expression levels of ALP, Runx2, Osx and Col1a1
  at seven days of osteogenic differentiation in the four cell groups. (C) ALP activity
  at seven days of osteogenic differentiation in the four cell groups. (D) ALP staining
  at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of osteogenic differentiation in the four cell groups.
  The deeper and larger blue-purple staining represents more ALP expression. The bar
  represents the mean Â± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p
  < 0.0001
