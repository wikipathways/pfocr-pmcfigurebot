figure_title: The role of FOSL1 in promoting drug resistance and radio resistance.
caption: 'The role of FOSL1 in promoting drug resistance and radio resistance. FOSL1
  plays a role in drug resistance through various mechanisms. It enhances resistance
  to chemotherapy agents and radiotherapy by influencing the PI3K, ERK, ERK/JAN, and
  ITGB4 signaling pathways. Moreover, FOSL1 exerts a critical role in cancer drug
  resistance by regulating processes like EMT, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and
  miRNAs. EMT: epithelial–mesenchymal transition'
