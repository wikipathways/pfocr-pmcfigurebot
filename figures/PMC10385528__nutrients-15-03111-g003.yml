caption: Anticancer mode of action of melittin on the essential molecular targets
  in different carcinomas. Melittin exerts its anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis,
  cell cycle arrest, modulation of the oncogenic signaling pathway, inhibiting metastasis,
  and promoting chemo/radio sensitivity. The vital molecular targets associated with
  melittin’s growth inhibitory and apoptotic inducing potential are Bax, Bcl-2, caspases,
  Akt, HIF-α, NF-kB, Wnt, STAT3, MMPs, VEGF, and TNF-α
