caption: A schematic diagram of ERS in immune cells in SLE and LN. An abnormal ER
  stress (ERS) pathway is closely related to the autoimmune diseases, such as SLE
  and LN. ERS promotes B cells differentiate into plasma cell and increased antibody
  secretion by activating IRE1–XBP1 and CHOP pathways. TLR promotes the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages by activating the IRE1αXBP1 pathway.
  ERS can also activate the ATF6 pathway to further activate the NF-κB inflammatory
  pathway and promote the secretion of inflammatory factors in macrophages. ERS drives
  T cell differentiation by activating the IRE1XBP1 pathway and can also activate
  the CHOP pathway to promote the T cell apoptosis. ERS participates in the formation
  and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and the production of inflammatory
  cytokines in neutrophils. ERS participates in antigen presentation and cytokine
  secretion of DCs by activating the IRE1XBP1 and CHOP pathways
