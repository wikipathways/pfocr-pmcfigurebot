caption: Progression model of the CLL through S100A9 overexpression in the leukemic
  cells and plasma exosomes. Increased expression of S100A9 within CLL leukemic cells
  during the disease progression (but not in the indolent phase) activates NF-kB signaling
  pathway mediators. In addition, secreted S100A9-containing exosomes from CLL leukemic
  cells activate the NF-kB signaling pathway mediators, which results in proliferation
  and survival signaling. Increased levels of S100A9 within the exosomes are detectable
  in CLL patientsâ€™ plasma during the disease progression. (CLL; chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia, NF-kB; nuclear factor kappa B). Created with BioRender.com (accessed on
