figure_title: Stage-specific stem cell niches between early and later stages.
caption: Stage-specific stem cell niches between early and later stages. A. Heatmaps
  showing stem cell-related signaling pathways. Hit of the same signaling pathway
  identified by the EnrichR were pooled. B. Log p-value (PV) plotted against the pathways.
  * Uniqueness or significant differences between mild and severe stages. HC, hematopoietic
  cell (HC); SCF, stem cell factor; SP, surfactant. Other abbreviations are used in
  their common meanings
