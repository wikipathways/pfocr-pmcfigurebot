  Wnt signaling

  krt5 mRNA level expressed in AEC2s were measured after silencing the expression of Fzd5 or Fzd6. The silenced Fzd5 and silenced Fzd6 AEC2 were subsequently treated with 60 ng.ml−1 of sFRP2 for 48 h. n= 3 independent biological replicates. (C) Level of expression of krt5 and axin 2 mRNA were measured in AEC2 cells treated with CaMKII inhibitor KN93 (1ug.ml−1) with or without sFRP2 (60ng.ml−1) for 48 h. (D) Schematic of the sFRP2-FZD5 signaling pathway promoting the expression of KRT5 in AECs created with BioRender.com. Statistical significance was determined by One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons (B) and unpaired 2-tailed t-test (C)
