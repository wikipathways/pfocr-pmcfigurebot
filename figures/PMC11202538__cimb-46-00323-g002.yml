figure_title: Crosstalk with the Shh signalling pathway.
caption: Crosstalk with the Shh signalling pathway. Cross talk is a phenomenon that
  occurs when multiple signalling pathways can affect the same protein and lead to
  similar effects. Alongside the normal Shh signalling pathway, expression of GLI1/2
  can be regulated by MAPK/MEK signalling as well as PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling. MEK
  is known to induce GLI1/2 signalling, while PI3K maintains a positive feedback loop
  through GLI1/2. PI3K signalling induces GLI1/2 expression which in turn leads to
  inhibition of PTEN, an inhibitor of AKT protein, which is essential for PI3K signalling.
  PI3K signalling is also known to increase SOX2 expression directly. The exact mechanism
  in which WNT signalling has crosstalk with Shh signalling is unknown (Indicated
  by the dotted arrow); however, Shh-related genes (SOX2/NANOG/PTCH1 and C-MYC) have
  been found to be upregulated in the presence of WNT signalling. This crosstalk with
  multiple pathways poses problems, as inhibition of the Shh signalling pathway can
  be bypassed by alternative signalling pathways. This is seen particularly when targeting
  SMO, an upstream regulator of Shh signalling, as GLI1/2 appears to be the common
  link between canonical and non-canonical (crosstalk) Shh signalling
