figure_title: A proposed model that the Sw-5b NLR immune receptor mimics the behavior
  of the ABA receptors and directly modulates the ABA central regulator PP2C-SnRK2
  to activate antiviral immunity
caption: At the center of the ABA signaling regulation, PP2C4 interacts with and constitutively
  inhibits SnRK2.3/2.4. Upon detection of ABA, the ABA receptors PYLs undergo a conformational
  change that allows them to bind to PP2C4. This binding releases SnRK2 from PP2C
  inhibition, thereby allowing SnRK2 to activate the downstream ABA signaling pathway
  (upper). The Sw-5b NLR immune receptor behaves in a similar manner to ABA receptors
  to activate ABA signaling. Sw-5b NLR is maintained in an inactive state in the absence
  of the viral effector NSm. Upon detection of the viral effector NSm, Sw-5b NLR switches
  from an inactive state to an active state. The conformational changes of Sw-5b allow
  it to bind to PP2C4 through its NB domain, and this binding interferes with the
  interaction between PP2C4 and SnRK2.2/2.4, thereby releasing SnRK2 from PP2C-mediated
  inhibition to activate ABA-dependent antiviral immunity (lower).
