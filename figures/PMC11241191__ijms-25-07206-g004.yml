caption: SRI interacts with STAT3, inhibits apoptosis and activates the NF-κB signaling
  pathway in vitro and in vivo. (A–D) SRI downexpression reduced the fluorescence
  intensity of TMRE (shown in red) and enhanced the apoptosis sensitivities by Hoechst
  33342 (shown in blue) staining assay. The results of SRI overexpression were consisted
  with SRI downexpression. Scale bars = 200 μm. (E–J) Western blot detected the expression
  of STAT3, p65, p-p65, p-IκB and apoptosis-related proteins when SRI overexpression
  or downexpression were found in HCC cell and tumor xenografts. (K,L) Representative
  IHC images of STAT3, p65, p-p65, p-IκB and apoptosis-related proteins when SRI overexpression
  or downexpression were found in tumor xenografts. The expression of proteins were
  determined by the brown area. Scale bars = 50 μm. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
