caption: 'Effects of different intervention methods on MetaCyc metabolic pathway in
  mice at day 42. (a) MetaCyc metabolic pathway heat map after different intervention
  methods. (b) As shown in the Circos diagram, genes for enzyme activity were altered
  in five groups (Enzyme nomenclature database). CTL: control; ATBX: antibiotic; EXC:
  exercise; KGM: the native KGM; EK: combination of exercise and KGM. Samples (N =
  15) were colored by treatment'
