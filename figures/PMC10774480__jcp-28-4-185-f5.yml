figure_title: Dendropanax morbifera Leveille extract (DME) regulated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway
caption: (A) The expression levels of proteins related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway were determined using western blotting after treating SK-Hep1 cells with
  0, 10, 20, or 40 µg/mL DME for 24 hours. (B) Band intensity was normalized using
  a total form protein. (C) Cells were treated with 0 or 40 µg/mL DME and the AKT
  inhibitor LY294002, and the levels of p-AKT were assessed by western blotting analysis.
  Band intensities were normalized to total AKT. β-actin was used as an internal control.
  Values indicate the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 as shown by the Student’s t-test
