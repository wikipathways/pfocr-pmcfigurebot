caption: GSEA analysis of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Enrichment plot and heatmap
  showing significant enrichment in the (A) Npc1−/−App−/− cerebral cortex and (B)
  cerebellum compared with its Npc1−/−/App+/+, Npc1+/+/App−/−, and Npc1+/+/App+/+
  counterparts. ES = enrichment score; NES = normalized enrichment score; FDR-q =
  false discovery rate q-value. Significance is determined by an FDR-q < 0.25
