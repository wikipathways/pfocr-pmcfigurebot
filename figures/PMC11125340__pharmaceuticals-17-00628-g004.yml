figure_title: PDGFRB was identified as an important downstream target gene of BW18.
caption: 'PDGFRB was identified as an important downstream target gene of BW18. (A)
  Volcano plot shows the DEGs between HEL cells treated with and without BW18. Red
  dots represent up-regulated genes, green dots represented down-regulated genes and
  grey dots represented unchanged genes. DEGs were identified according to the following
  criteria: |log2 (fold change)| ≥ 1 and FDR < 0.0001. (B) PPI network of 184 BW18-related
  DEGs. Red represents hub genes. (C) Top 20 clusters of enrichment analysis of 184
  BW18-related DEGs from Metascape. (D) Using ClueGO analysis of 184 BW18-related
  DEGs, 15 signaling pathways were significantly enriched (p < 0.05). (E–G) Effects
  of BW18 on expression of PDGFRB in HEL cells. (E) mRNA level. (F,G) Protein level.
  All data are expressed as the mean ± SD. β-actin was used as the loading control.
  Each experiment was repeated in triplicate. * p < 0.05, and ** p < 0.01 vs. the
  control group'
