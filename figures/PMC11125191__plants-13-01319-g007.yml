caption: A schematic diagram of the ethylene (ETH) signaling pathway. The ETH receptor,
  ETR1, binds ETH and fails to activate CTR1, leading to the release of phosphate-carrying
  Arabidopsis histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs). Simultaneously, the ethylene
  insensitive 2 (EIN2) undergoes degradation and the C-terminus is cleaved to produce
  EIN2-CEND. Both the AHPs and EIN2-CEND are transferred to the nucleus; the transfer
  of the phosphate groups on AHPs to ARRs results in transcriptional changes in the
  ethylene-responsive genes. EIN2-CEND interacts with the histone-binding protein
  EIN2 NUCLEAR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1 (ENAP1) to enhance the ability of dimerized EIN3
  to bind to the target gene and regulate EIN3-dependent transcriptional activation.
  The dotted line arrows indicate the transfer of substances, and thick arrows indicate
  the facilitation of these processes [80]
