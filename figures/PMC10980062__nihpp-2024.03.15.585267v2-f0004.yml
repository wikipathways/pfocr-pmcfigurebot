figure_title: DEGs are underrepresented in perturbed gene programs
caption: (a—c). Circular heatmaps illustrating cell-type specific dysregulation pattern
  of active genes amongst all perturbed pathways (unique and broad). Yellow and purple
  strips represent upregulated and downregulated genes respectively (false discovery
  rate (FDR) < 0.01 and abs(log2(fold change)>0.25), while grey regions represent
  non-DEGs, suggesting sparse presence of DEGs relative to total genes within the
  gene programs. (d—f). Table showing number of DEGs in the gene programs comprising
  perturbed pathways in each cell type.
