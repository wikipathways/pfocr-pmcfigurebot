figure_title: Effect of resveratrol on the mTOR signaling pathway.
caption: Effect of resveratrol on the mTOR signaling pathway. (A) pAKT/AKT. (B) pmTOR/mTOR.
  (C) pP70S6K/P70S6K. (D) pS6/S6. (E) Representative Western blots of all proteins
  at different glucose concentrations around the circadian cycle. C2C12 myotubes were
  incubated with resveratrol for 6 h and analyzed for an additional 24 h. Western
  blots were performed to determine protein levels. All time-points are expressed
  as average daily levels. Within each panel, protein levels display statistical significance
  (p < 0.05) only when bars are presented with different letters
