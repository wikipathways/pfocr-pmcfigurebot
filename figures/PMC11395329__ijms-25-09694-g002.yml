figure_title: MiR-27a-5p mimic downregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  via the NF-κB pathway.
caption: 'MiR-27a-5p mimic downregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  via the NF-κB pathway. (a) hDPCs were transfected with NC or the miR-27a-5p mimic
  for 24 h and then stimulated with LPS for 4 h. MiR-27a-5p expression was measured
  by RT-qPCR to verify the transfection efficiency (mean ± SD, n = 4). (b) Western
  blot analysis of NF-κB p65 (RELA) phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated hDPCs with GAPDH
  serving as the internal control (mean ± SD, n = 3). (c) NF-κB reporter activity
  was evaluated by luciferase reporter assays in LPS-stimulated hDPCs (mean ± SD,
  n = 4). (d) mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP1 measured by RT-qPCR after miR-27a-5p
  overexpression in LPS-stimulated hDPCs (mean ± SD, n = 4). (e) Cytometric bead array
  of proinflammatory cytokines after miR-27a-5p overexpression in LPS-stimulated hDPCs
  (mean ± SD, n = 4). **** p < 0.0001; *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05. LPS:
  lipopolysaccharide; hDPCs: human dental pulp cells; NC: miRNA mimic Negative Control
  #1; miR-27a: miRNA mimic for miR-27a-5p'
