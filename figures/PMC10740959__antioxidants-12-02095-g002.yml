figure_title: Differential metabolites in the muscle of C.
caption: Differential metabolites in the muscle of C. carpio between the NC (MNC)
  and 0.8 g/kg Pro-fed groups (MPro). (A,B) Volcano plot of the differential metabolites
  in positive (Pos) and negative (Neg) ion modes. (C,D) Numbers and classification
  of the differential metabolites in Pos and Neg ion modes. (E) Main KEGG pathways
  enriched by the differential metabolites in Pos and Neg ion modes. (F) Differential
  metabolites related to lipids and lipid-like molecules (FA, fatty acyls; GP, glycerophospholipids;
  SD, steroids and steroid derivatives; GL, glycerolipids; SP, sphingolipid; and PL,
  prenol lipid). (G) Differential metabolites related to phenylpropanoids and polyketides.
  (H) Differential metabolites related to amino acids
