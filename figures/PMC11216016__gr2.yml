caption: 'Nano-S regulates Hippo signal pathway during wound healing. (A) CCK-8 assay
  to evaluate proliferation rate of HSF cells induced by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + Verteporfin
  (Hippo pathway inhibitor) and Nano-Se. (B) Clonal formation assay to evaluate proliferation
  rate of HSF cells induced by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + Verteporfin (Hippo pathway inhibitor)
  and Nano-Se. (C) Representative images of edu assay to evaluate the proliferating
  HSF cells induced by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + Verteporfin (Hippo pathway inhibitor)
  and Nano-Se. (D) Quantitative analysis of the Edu+ cells induced by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + Verteporfin
  (Hippo pathway inhibitor) and Nano-Se. (E) Flow cytometry analysis of the proportion
  of edu+/hoechst+ cells treated with Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + Verteporfin (Hippo pathway
  inhibitor) and Nano-Se. (F) Quantitative analysis of the edu+/hoechst+ cells induced
  by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + Verteporfin (Hippo pathway inhibitor) and Nano-Se. (G)
  Representative images of the Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + Verteporfin (Hippo pathway inhibitor)
  and Nano-Se accelerate caudal fin regeneration. Dpa: days past amputation. (H) Regeneration
  rate of zebrafish caudal fin treated with Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + Verteporfin (Hippo
  pathway inhibitor) and Nano-Se on different days. (3 independent biological repeats
  n = 9). (Mean values ± SD, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001).'
