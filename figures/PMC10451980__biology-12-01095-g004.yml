caption: GSEA analysis revealing the critical pathways associated with the cell cycle.
  (Aâ€“F) The down-regulated genes were enriched in DNA replication, cellular response
  to the DNA damage stimulus, DNA repair, ATP-dependent activity, acting on DNA, the
  mitotic cell cycle, and in the regulation of the cell cycle pathway as revealed
  from GSEA analysis
