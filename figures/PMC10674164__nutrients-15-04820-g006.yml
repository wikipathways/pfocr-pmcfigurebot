caption: APE and AFE inhibited the MAPK signaling pathway in the colonic tissues of
  the CAC mice, as determined via Western blotting. (A) Effects of APE on p-ERK/ERK,
  P38, and p-JNK/JNK in the colonic tissues of the CAC mice. (B) The relative intensities
  of the expression of (A) normalized against total proteins. (C) Effects of AFE on
  p-ERK/ERK, P38, JNK, and c-fos in the colonic tissues of the CAC mice. (D) The relative
  intensities of the expression of (C). Data are presented as the mean Â± SD; * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. AOM/DSS group
