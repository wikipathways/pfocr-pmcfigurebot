  LUAD.
caption: 'In vitro experiments to explore the molecular mechanism of UBE2C in LUAD.
  (A) Gene expression levels of UBE2C in common human LUAD cell lines from the Cancer
  Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database. (B) The protein and mRNA expression levels
  of UBE2C detected after siRNA transfection in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. (C) Effect
  of UBE2C siRNA knockdown on the proliferation of NCI-H1299 and A549 cells by Cell
  Counting Kit 8 assay. (D-E) Effect of UBE2C siRNA knockdown on NCI-H1299 and A549
  cell cycle (D) and cell apoptosis (E) by flow cytometry. (F) siUBE2C inhibits the
  PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in LUAD: (a) UBE2C expression and somatic changes
  in Akt-mTOR signaling pathway using proteomics; (b) NCI-H1299 and A549 cells were
  transiently transfected with siUBE2C for 48 h, and the expression of Akt, phospho-Akt,
  mTOR and phospho-mTOR was then analyzed by Western blot. Î²-Actin was used as a loading
  control. LUAD = Lung adenocarcinoma (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p
  < 0.0001)'
