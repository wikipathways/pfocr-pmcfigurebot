figure_title: Roflumilast mitigates damage of H/R to H9C2 cell viability by activating
  the AMPK signaling pathway.
caption: 'Roflumilast mitigates damage of H/R to H9C2 cell viability by activating
  the AMPK signaling pathway. (A) Effect roflumilast on H9C2 cell viability was analyzed
  using CCK-8 assay. (B) Viability of H/R-induced H9C2 cells treated with roflumilast
  was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. (C) Expression AMPK signaling pathway-related proteins
  in H/R-induced H9C2 cells with roflumilast treatment was detected by western blotting.
  (D) Apoptosis of H/R-induced H9C2 cells with roflumilast and compound C treatment
  was analyzed by TUNEL assay. (E) Expression of apoptosis-related proteins in H/R-induced
  H9C2 cells with roflumilast and compound C treatment was detected by western blotting.
