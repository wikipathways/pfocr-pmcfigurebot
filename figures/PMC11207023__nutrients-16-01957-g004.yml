caption: Network pharmacological analysis suggested potential anti-PTSD components
  in EVO. (A) Venn map of PTSD-associated genes combined with the Venn map and EVO-PTSD
  intersecting target genes. (B) Protein interaction network of EVO for PTSD. (C)
  Finding the core of the PPI network. (D) Results of GO enrichment plotted as bars
  and bubbles. (E) KEGG enrichment results in bar and bubble plots. The length of
  the bar and the size of the bubble indicate the number of targets enriched, and
  the color of the bar and node from red to blue indicates the p value from large
  to small. Therefore, the darker the red color is the greater the significance of
  the signaling pathway, indicating the greater importance of the signaling pathway
