caption: 'Citrus’ resilience mechanisms to recurrent drought stress: (A) Epigenetic
  Underpinning and ABA Signaling: The observed DNA methylation profiles in scions
  and rootstocks suggest an epigenetic underpinning. This epigenetic modulation, combined
  with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways, enhances citrus’ resilience to water
  scarcity. ABA-mediated mechanisms play a pivotal role in orchestrating adaptive
  responses. (B) Enhanced Citrus Resilience: The interaction between DNA methylation
  patterns and ABA signaling significantly enhances citrus plants’ ability to cope
  with recurrent drought stress. This enhanced resilience is evident through physiological
  responses and antioxidant system activation, both contributing to reduced reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production [45]'
