figure_title: Microglial p65/NFkB associates with disease associated microglia (DAM)
caption: (A) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) clustering representation
  of cortical microglial cells, derived from ~39K cells in the inCITE dataset, with
  disease state regressed out. (B) in silico isolation of microglia nuclei and uniform
  manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) clustering based on batch corrected
  gene expression patterns, without regression of disease state. (C) Heatmap illustrating
  differential gene expression patterns across the identified microglial subclusters.
  (D) Gene counts for disease associated microglia (DAM) and homeostatic markers across
  cells. (E) Comprehensive analysis of inferred pathways prevalent in the microglial
  clusters by Progeny and mapping of inferred pathway scores onto cells in UMAP, red
  signal indicates higher expression of pathway genes. (F) GSEA analysis of TNF-alpha
  signaling pathway within clusters 0 and 1 in contrast to other clusters from MsigDB.
  (G) Scatter plot showing correlations (Spearmann) between donor age and disease
  status and its respective contribution to individual microglial clusters and (H)
  scatter plot showing correlation between the number of nuclei in DAM-enriched cluster
  0 and pTau levels determined by Western blot in the same brain tissue. (I) Violin
  plot showing the mean level of p65/NFkB protein (normalized to levels of histone
  H3 protein) in cells of microglial cluster 1 and 0, and informatic isolation of
  nuclei with highest (Top 10th percentile), high (Top 10â€“25th percentile) and low
  (Bottom 25th percentile) levels of NFkB:H3 shown as a density plot. Areas of the
  UMAP enriched for cells falling into this range of NFkB:H3 are red, lower levels
  are blue. (J) Scatter plot showing gene weight (relative association in the NFkB
  pathway as predicted by the Progeny database, X-axis) and log fold change between
  Cluster 0 and other clusters (Y-axis). In red are transcripts increased or decreased
  in a manner consistent with NFkB activation, and in blue are transcripts following
  a pattern of reduced NFkB activity. (K) Similar plot for Cluster 1
