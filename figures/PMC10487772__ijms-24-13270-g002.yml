caption: Overview of different lipid classes and their synthesis pathways. The major
  classes of lipids (sterols, fatty acids (FAs), sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids)
  important for this review are depicted with their chemical structure and the key
  steps of their synthesis pathway. Eicosanoids, such as arachidonic acid, are classified
  as a type of FAs. CDP = cytidine diphosphate; CoA = Coenzyme A; GPC = glycerophosphocholine;
  GPE = glycerophosphoethanolamine; GPS = glycerophosphoserine; HETE = hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acids; HMG = β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl; MUFAs = monounsaturated fatty acids; P
  = phosphate; PUFAs = polyunsaturated fatty acids; TCA = tricarboxylic acid
