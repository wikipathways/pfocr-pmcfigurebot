caption: Taurine promotes mutant and wild-type p53 binding to DNA and p53-mediated
  p21 activation. (A) Differential transcriptomic analysis of the TP53 gene pathway
  in FNE-m-p53 cell monolayers grown under normal conditions or in media supplemented
  with taurine. (B) Quantification of p53 binding to its response element using a
  p53 Transcription Factor Assay Kit (Cayman). For each cell line, data were normalized
  to the mean of the respective control group and are reported as a fold change. (C)
  Histogram representation of flow cytometry-based analysis of taurine-induced p21
  promoter activation. Cells were transduced with a plasmid encoding mCherry cloned
  downstream of either EF1-Î± (CSII-mCherry) or the p21 promoter (p21-mCherry). (D)
  Western blots of p21 and p53 expression in OC cell lines expressing mutant or wild-type
  p53. (E) mRNA expression of various cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in FNE-m-p53
  cells cultured in the absence or presence of taurine. Each dot is one replicate.
  Data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. (F) mRNA quantification and Western blot
  analysis of p21 expression in FNE-m-p53 cells cultured in taurine or valine. The
  p-value represents control vs. taurine as determined by a one-way ANOVA. (G) Western
  blots of p21 and p53 expression in FNE-m-p53 and FNE (WT p53) cell lines cultured
  in taurine following transduction with either scramble shRNA or p53 shRNA.
