caption: IRPM score heterogeneity and associated immune characteristics in tumor microenvironments.
  (A,B) The UMAP visualization shows nine main cell types in a single-cell pancreatic
  cancer data (GSE2129664), colored by cell type (A) and the IRPM scores (B). (C)
  Violin plot for the IRPM scores in different cell subtypes. (D) Circle plots depicting
  the interaction numbers and interaction strength between high-IRPM epithelial cells,
  low-IRPM epithelial cells, and other cell subtypes, respectively. (E) Dot plot illustrating
  substantial ligand-receptor interactions between high-IRPM/low-IRPM epithelial cells
  and surrounding cells. The CellChat program used colors to represent the communication
  possibility. The permutation p-value is shown by point size. (F,G) KEGG (F) and
  immune-related (G) pathways enrichment analysis of DEGs in high- and low-IRPM score
  groups. ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
