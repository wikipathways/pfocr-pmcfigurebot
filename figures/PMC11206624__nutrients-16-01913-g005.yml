figure_title: MLP regulated protein expression within the AMPK signaling pathway.
caption: MLP regulated protein expression within the AMPK signaling pathway. (a) Proteins
  AMPK, SREBP-1, FAS, and ACC were identified using a Western blot, and the (b) AMPK
  levels and (c) levels of SREBP-1, ACC, and FAS in each group were determined. Each
  value represents the mean ± SEM (n = 4). Tukey’s multiple comparison test shows
  a significant difference (p < 0.05) between values that do not share a common letter
