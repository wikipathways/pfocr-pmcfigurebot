figure_title: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) promotes specific innate immune responses
  and upregulates 12 innate immune (innatome) genes.
caption: 'Chronic kidney disease (CKD) promotes specific innate immune responses and
  upregulates 12 innate immune (innatome) genes. The gene expression changes of the
  innate immune response genes in the veins of CKD patients are compared to those
  of non-CKD controls. (A) CKD significantly modulates the expression of 119 innate
  immune response genes with 12 upregulated genes in the veins of CKD patients. (B)
  Metascape pathway analysis showed top pathways of 12 CKD-upregulated immune response
  genes. (C) The trained immunity regulator SET7 contributes to CKD. Microarray expression
  data from SET7-depleted H9 human embryonic stem cells (GSE53038, PMID: 25479749)
  were collected (Log2FC > 1, p < 0.05). The genes upregulated by CKD were crossed
  with the genes downregulated by SET7 depletion. Fifteen genes upregulated in CKD
  were significantly downregulated in SET7 depletion. (D) Metascape analysis showed
  top pathways of 15 CKD-upregulated and SET7 deficiency-downregulated genes. The
  1367 innate immune response gene list was collected from the InnateDB database (https://www.innatedb.com,
