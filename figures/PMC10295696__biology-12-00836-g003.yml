caption: Predicted three-dimensional structures of enzymes related to the ascorbate
  biosynthesis pathway of A. fulica using the homology prediction method and templates
  from related molluscan species. These enzymes consist of (A) UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase
  (UGDH), (B) glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), (C) alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), (D)
  gluconolactonase (GNL), (E) gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), (F) dehydroascorbate reductase
  (DHAR), (G) myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), and (H) ascorbate oxidase (AO)
