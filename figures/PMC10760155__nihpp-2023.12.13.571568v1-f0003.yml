caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway to pazamine and pazamide (A) Cyclopropanation
  is proposed to take place in two steps. In the first step, radical halogenation
  of 4 by PazA incorporates a leaving group for the next step. In the second step,
  the PLP-dependent enzyme PazB reacts with 5 to form the external aldimine. Cα-deprotonation
  yields the quinonoid carbanion intermediate that can carry out an SN2-like reaction
  at C4 to form the carbocycle with stereoinversion and concomitant loss of chloride.
  1 is then released from the PLP cofactor and is succinylated by AOST to produce
  2. (B) A model of the PazB active site was generated by AlphaFold and the quinonoid
  intermediate before carbocyclization was docked in with AutoDock Vina. In this model,
  a polar pocket is observed and proposed to bind the ε-ammonium group in order to
  bring C4 into proximity of Cα for cyclization. The bending of the chain also appears
  to be assisted by steric interactions with F79 and F80
