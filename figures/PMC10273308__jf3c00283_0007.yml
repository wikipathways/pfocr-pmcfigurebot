caption: Effect of SA on regulation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling. (A) Strip plot of
  NF-κB P65 western blot in the mouse colon, (B) relative quantitative plot of NF-κB
  P65 phosphorylated protein in the mouse colon, (C) strip plot of P38/JNK/ERK western
  blot in the mouse colon, and (D) relative quantitative plot of P38/JNK/ERK phosphorylated
  protein in the mouse colon. Values given are mean ± SD (n = 3). a,b,c,d,e,f Values
  with different letters were significantly different (P < 0.05).
