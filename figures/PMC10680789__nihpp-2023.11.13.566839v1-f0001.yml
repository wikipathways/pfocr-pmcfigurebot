figure_title: COQ4-deficient human cells accumulate 10P-HB
caption: A) The biosynthetic pathway of CoQ in eukaryotes. Proteins shared by S. cerevisiae
  and humans are in green, and those specific to S. cerevisiae or humans are in orange
  and blue, respectively. 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB) is the aromatic precursor of
  CoQ and the numbering of the carbon atoms used throughout this study is shown for
  polyprenyl-4-HB (nP-HB). Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate
  (FPP) are building blocks for the synthesis of the polyprenyl pyrophosphate tail
  (PPP) which is added onto 4-HB by Coq2. The polyprenyl chain (n=6 for S. cerevisiae,
  n=10 for humans) is depicted by R on all intermediates derived from nP-HB. The uncharacterized
  steps for C1-decarboxylation and C1-hydroxylation are indicated with red question
  marks. An alternative order for the early steps is depicted by dashed arrows. The
  biosynthetic intermediates are represented in reduced form but they may also exist
  in their oxidized form as depicted for polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone (PBQn). B-C)
  Superimposition of electrochomatograms (B) and chromatograms of single ion monitoring
  (m/z 836.6 in positive mode) of 10P-HB in lipid extracts from WT, ΔCOQ4 and ΔCOQ6
  HEK293 cells (0.2 mg protein), with CoQ8 used as standard. D) Targeted mass spectrometry
  quantification of CoQ10 (left) and 10P-HB from human primary fibroblast samples
  normalized to a CoQ8 internal standard. The data are representative of biological
  triplicates (B-D)
