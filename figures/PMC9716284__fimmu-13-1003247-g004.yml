caption: Functional profiles of the microbiota along the hind-gut in Dezhou donkeys.
  (A) Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and PERMANOVA test (P = 0.001) showing
  significant differences in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) function
  in pathway level 3 of the C and DC groups. (B) Differential KEGG metabolic pathways
  were observed between the C and DC groups at level 3 (*p< 0.05). (C) Species contribution
  relationship of KEGG functions at the gene level in the C and DC groups. C, cecum;
  VC, ventral colon; DC, dorsal colon.
