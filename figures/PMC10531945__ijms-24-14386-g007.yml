caption: Major pathways downstream of mTORC1 signaling in mRNA translation. mTORC1
  promotes protein synthesis by phosphorylation of two key effectors, eIF4E binding
  protein 1 (4E-BP1) and p70S6 Kinase (p70S6K). 4E-BP1 inhibits translation by binding
  and sequestering eukaryotic translation initiation factor-4E (eIF4E) to prevent
  assembly of the eIF4F complex. eIF4F complex mediates the recruitment of ribosomes
  to mRNA, which is the rate-limiting step for translation. mTORC1 phosphorylates
  4E-BP1 at multiple sites to trigger its dissociation from eIF4E, allowing 5′-cap-dependent
  mRNA translation to occur. Unrelated to 4E-BP1, mTORC1 phosphorylates p70S6K, stimulating
  its subsequent phosphorylation. p70S6K phosphorylates and activates several substrates
  that promote mRNA translation initiation, including S6.
