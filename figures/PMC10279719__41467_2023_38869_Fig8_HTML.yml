figure_title: Unified SPR analysis of PEAK protein interactions and proposed model
  for PEAK3/Grb2 and PEAK3/CrkII regulation via the tandem site 14-3-3 motif
caption: a SPR binding contributions were measured for PEAK interactors (14-3-3ɣ,
  GrbFL and CrkIIFL and sub-domains) toward immobilized PEAK proteins with or without
  phosphorylation by Src. Tabulated mean SPR affinity values (KD) are colored as a
  heat map to illustrate trends in affinity. Gray cells represent KD > 50 µM or no
  detectable binding. b Representative SPR sensorgrams for key interactions of PEAK3FL.
  c A unifying model of PEAK3 interactions. Avidity stabilizes PEAK3/CrkII interaction
  with clustered CrkII (interacting via the CrkIINSH3 and tandem motif PRM of the
  PEAK3 dimer). CrkII is likely to be clustered by interaction with other adapters/scaffolds,
  such as SH2 domain-mediated binding to partner proteins containing multiple adjacent
  pYxxP motifs (e.g., present in known Src substrates p130cas/NEDD9, paxillin), but
  possibly also via dimerization (e.g., SH2-mediated as we identify for recombinant
  protein). Phosphorylation of PEAK3 at S69 creates a high-affinity binding site for
  14-3-3, leading to the formation of a highly stable PEAK:14-3-3 dimer:dimer. Phosphorylation/binding
  of 14-3-3 to PEAK3 destabilizes CrkII binding in the adjacent tandem site (negative
  cooperativity), disfavoring PEAK3/CrkII complexes. Possible outcomes are termination
  of PEAK3/CrkII signaling and/or alter PEAK3 sub-cellular localization. CrkII may
  facilitate colocalization of PEAK3 to regions with active Src kinase (e.g., p130cas
  at focal adhesions). Phosphorylation of PEAK3 at Y24 (e.g., by Src kinase) recruits
  Grb2 via its SH2 domain leading to downstream signaling that alters cell motility
  (e.g., via association with ASAP1 and PYK2 and potential PYK2/ASAP1-mediated activation
  of the PI3K/AKT pathway). Thus, PEAK3 S69A mutation abrogates 14-3-3 binding and
  promotes CrkII association and PEAK Y24 phosphorylation/Grb2 signaling, culminating
  in enhanced in cell motility. d Illustrative representation of a potential dimeric
  human PEAK3FL:14-3-3ε complex to show relative scale and key sites of interaction.
  Depicted is the 14-3-3ε:PEAK3tandem-pS69 crystal structure (PDB 8DGP) and a structural
  model of the PEAK3SHED-PsK dimer prepared from AlphaFold2 multimer modeling of a
  human PEAK3FL dimer,. Unmodelled IDR linker regions are depicted as dotted lines.
