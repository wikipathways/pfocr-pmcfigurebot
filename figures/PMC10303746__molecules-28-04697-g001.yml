caption: Analysis of mogroside metabolites in the post-ripening fruits of Siraitia
  grosvenorii. (a) Cluster heatmap of mogroside metabolites in post-ripening fruits,
  the metabolites under the pink background represent mogroside IIE and its isomers
  which contain two glucosyl units, the metabolites under the blue background represent
  mogroside III and its isomers which contain three glucosyl units, the metabolites
  under the yellow background represent siamenoside I and its isomers which contain
  four glucosyl units, the metabolites under the green background represent mogroside
  V and its isomers which contain five glucosyl units, and the metabolites under the
  yellow background represent mogroside VI and its isomers which contain six glucosyl
  units. (b) The synthesis pathway of sweet mogrosides, glycosyltransferase UGT94-289-3
  can continuously catalyze glycosylation using mogroside IIE as a substrate to obtain
  various sweet mogrosides. (c) The quantitative results of five mogrosides (mogroside
  IIE, mogroside III, siamenoside I, mogroside V, and mogroside VI), the lowercase
  letters represent statistically significant differences (p < 0.5)
