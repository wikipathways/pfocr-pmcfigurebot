figure_title: GSDMD KO modulates the transcriptional response to hyperoxia in the
  hippocampus
caption: A. Volcano plot of genes differentially expressed in brains of KO-O2 mice
  compared to WT-O2 mice (fold change >1.25 and FDR<0.1). B. Gene set enrichment analysis
  of genes differentially expressed in hyperoxia-exposed KO mice compared to hyperoxia-exposed
  WT mice. In the KO-O2 group, there was an induction of genes associated with negative
  regulation of nervous system development, regulation of neuronal synaptic plasticity,
  hippocampus development, negative regulation of neurogenesis, endothelial cell chemotaxis,
  postsynapse organization, extracellular structure organization, and VEGFA/VEGFR2
  signaling compared to WT-O2 group. Hyperoxia-suppressed gene pathways were associated
  with neurotransmitter receptors and postsynaptic signal transmission, neuroactive
  ligand receptor interaction, synaptic transmission, synapse asseembly, blood vessel
  diameter maintenance, vascular process in circulatiory system, reponse to BMP, and
  oligodendrocyte differentiation. C. Network plot of select top biological processes
  and their associated genes induced in KO-O2 compared to WT-O2. D. Network plot of
  select top biological processes and their associated genes suppressed in KO-O2 compared
  to WT- O2 brains. n=4 animals/group in WT groups. n=3 animals/group in KO groups
