caption: A biological function and pathway analysis of cordycepin combined with doxorubicin
  against breast cancer. (a) The biological processes of cordycepin combined with
  doxorubicin against breast cancer. The text on the right shows the top 20 biological
  processes. The blue font shows the biological process related to apoptosis; the
  red font indicates the biological process related to proliferation; and the black
  font indicates the biological process related to migration. (b) Top 20 pathways
  enriched via cordycepin combined with doxorubicin against breast cancer
