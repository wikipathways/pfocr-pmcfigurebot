caption: SPARC affects NETs formation by regulating the NADPH oxidase pathway. (A)
  Biological function annotation enrichment analysis of significantly changed proteins
  in SPARC-knockdown HL60 cells. (B) The abundance of protein kinase C (PRKCA), neutrophil
  cytosol factor 1 (NCF1), neutrophil cytosol factor 2 (NCF2), and cytochrome b-245
  beta chain (CYBB). After knockdown of SPARC, NADPH oxidase pathway-related proteins
  are significantly upregulated (n = 3 per group; mean ± SEM, adjusted p-value was
  calculated by DESeq2 (version 1.24.0), Wald-test). (C) NADPH oxidase-related pathway
  protein expression and phosphorylation levels in HL60 cells were assessed by immunoblotting.
  After knockdown of SPARC, the protein expression and phosphorylation levels of NADPH
  oxidase-related pathway proteins are upregulated. (D) After stimulation of sh-NC
  and SPARC-knockdown dHL60 cells with 20 nM PMA, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  detection probe (DCFH-DA) was loaded and the fluorescence intensity was measured
  at 1 h, 2 h, and 5 h (n = 12 per group; mean ± SEM, Student’s t-test). (E) Western
  blotting analysis of SPARC-3 × Flag expression in HEK293T cells. The SPARC-3 × Flag
  plasmid was constructed for the subsequent identification of SPARC interacting proteins
  by mass spectrometry. (F) Interaction between exogenous SPARC and the receptor of
  activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1) in HEK293T cells was detected by Co-IP using
  anti-Flag beads. (G) Interaction between endogenous SPARC and RACK1 in HL60 cells
  was detected by Co-IP using IgG or SPARC antibodies. (H) Representative fluorescence
  images of the colocalization of SPARC (green) and RACK1 (red). Scale bar, 5 μm.
  Colocalization ratios were analyzed using ImageJ (version 1.53r) (n = 10 per group,
  mean ± SEM). **** p < 0.0001
