  mice.
caption: Ovulation is normal in Amhr2-Cre-mediated insulin receptor knockout mice.
  Mice were superovulated and sacrificed 12 h post-hCG for histological and molecular
  analyses. (A) Oviducts were extirpated, flushed with PBS, and retrieved COCs were
  counted (n = 8 control, n = 5 for each conditional knockout). (B) qPCR analysis
  of established ovulation-promoting genes in conditional insulin receptor knockout
  mice relative to control which was arbitrarily set to 1 (n = 10–12 per genotype).
  (C) qPCR analysis of rate-limiting enzyme for steroid synthesis, Star, and steroid
  hormone synthesis pathway genes relative to control which was arbitrarily set to
  1 (n = 12 per genotype). (A–C) Bar heights indicate mean ± SEM for each genotype
  with no significant differences (p > 0.05) observed between control and mutants
  determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison post-test
