caption: 'Antioxidant effects of the CBD. (A) Fluorescence images for Thiol tracker
  and (B) quantification analysis. (C) Total GSH contents in the protein lysates of
  hMSCs. (D) mRNA expression levels of GSH systems including GSS, (E) GPX3, and (F)
  GRS. (G) SOD activities in the protein lysates of hMSCs and mRNA expression levels
  of SOD family members including (H) SOD1, (I) SOD2, and (J) SOD3. (K) Catalase activities
  in the protein lysates for hMSCs and (L) mRNA expression levels of CAT. Images were
  captured by fluorescence filters equipped with microscopy conditions (630×). Data
  are expressed as mean ± S.E.M (n = 4 to 6 for each group). ##p < 0.01 and ###p <
  0.001 vs. normal group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. H2O2 group.'
