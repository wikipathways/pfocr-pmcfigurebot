caption: Proteins interacting with FUT8 and their biological effects in tumor progression.
  Aberrant core fucosylation mediated by FUT8 alters the biological function of key
  proteins, induces excessive activation of tumor signaling pathways, and promotes
  malignant transformation of tumors, such as proliferation, metastasis, and immunosuppression.
