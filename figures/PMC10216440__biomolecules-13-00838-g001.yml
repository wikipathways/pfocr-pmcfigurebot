figure_title: CGRP regulates various cells to promote bone repair.
caption: 'CGRP regulates various cells to promote bone repair. CGRP is secreted by
  sensory nerve cells, and its effects on bone tissue are: 1. CGRP can bind to the
  CLR receptor on the cell surface to directly enhance the osteoblast and osteogenic
  gene expression; 2. CGRP can inhibit the RANKL/RANK/NF-ÎºB pathway by increasing
  OPG level, inhibiting osteoclast proliferation, and reducing the osteoclast effect;
  3. CGRP can enhance the angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cells by promoting
  the expression of VEGF and HIF factors, induce angiogenesis, and provide nutritional
  support for bone repair; 4. CGRP can enhance the transformation of M0 into M2 macrophages
  and regulate the immune microenvironment of bone repair. CGRP is a calcitonin gene-related
  peptide, CLR is a calcein gene-related peptide receptor, RANK is the receptor activator
  of nuclear factor kappa B, RANKL is the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa
  B ligand, OPG is osteoprotegerin, HIF is a hypoxia-inducible factor, and VEGF is
  a vascular endothelial growth factor'
