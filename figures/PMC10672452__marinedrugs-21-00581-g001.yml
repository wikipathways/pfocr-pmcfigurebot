caption: LPS-induced inflammatory response of the innate immune system and the anti-inflammatory
  effect of LPS-binding peptides/proteins from marine invertebrates. Serum protein
  LBP (LPS-binding protein) binds the monomer of LPS and delivers it to a CD14 molecule.
  CD14 transfers LPS to the ectodomain of the TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex, which leads
  to homodimerization of TLR4. This change in TLR4 conformation provides a binding
  site for adaptor molecule MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein
  88). The MyD88-dependent signaling pathway leads to the activation of nuclear factor-κβ
  (NF-κβ), which regulates the expression of target genes encoding pro-inflammatory
  mediators. The overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may lead to an uncontrolled
  inflammatory reaction and eventually to sepsis. The binding of ILBP to LPS blocks
  CD14–LPS interaction and prevents the transfer of LPS to the TLR4/MD-2 complex,
  thus interfering with TLR4 dimerization and downstream inflammatory responses
