caption: Novel Sema3D antagonist CHOV20191024. A Predicted binding site of Sema3D
  according to the critical residues of Sema3A and PlexinA2 interface. K108, H216,
  and R404 were on Sema3A; K122, S233, and K422 were on Sema3D. B Cytotoxicity of
  CHOV20191024 was assessed in human neurons (SY5Y) and the total cell number was
  calculated at 48 h-post-treatment. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± SEM
  from three independent experiments. C CHOV20191024 rescued cell viability of Sema3D-treated
  SY5Y cells that were simultaneously treated with Sema3D and CHOV20191024 for 48 h.
  The MTT assay was conducted to determine cell viability. Quantitative western blot
  data are on the right (mean ± SEM) from three independent experiments. N.S. no significance;
  *p < 0.05. D CHOV20191024 reversed Sema3D-induced signaling cascade in SY5Y cells
  treated with Sema3D and CHOV20191024 for 24 h. Phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway was measured by western blot. E CHOV20191024 rescued Sema3D-induced
  autophagy dysfunction in SY5Y cells treated with Sema3D and CHOV20191024 for 72 h.
  Autophagy-associated proteins including mTOR, p62, Beclin-1, and LC3-II / I were
  measured by western blot. For Fig. 4D and E, quantitative data are presented as
  mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01
