figure_title: Verification of Logarithmic Signaling in the HOG Pathway through Gradual
  Cell Stress
caption: (A) Linear NaCl stress (with final concentrations of Cmax = 0.6M and 0.8M)
  lead to (B) increasing cell volume reduction and (C) decaying dynamics of Hog1 nuclear
  localization over time. (D) Exponential stress result in (E) increasing cell volume
  reduction and (F) increasing Hog1nuc dynamics over time. Fitting cell volume reduction
  to a polynomial function indicates that volume reduction changes with a smaller
  polynomial order under linear stress compared to exponential stress (see Figures
  S3D, S3F for Cmax = 0.6M and 0.8M). (G-I) Summation of cell volume reduction dynamics
  and the transient responses of Hog1nuc to NaCl stress with polynomial orders (k=1,2,3,5,7)
  generated (H) increasing cell volume reduction and (I) increasing Hog1nuc dynamics
  over time, similar to the responses observed with exponential stress at each final
  concentration. (J) A comparison between pulsatile and staircase NaCl stress, consisting
  of three equal-height step elevations, shows differential dynamics in both (K) cell
  volume reduction and (L) Hog1nuc responses over time. The lines represent means,
  and the shaded areas indicate standard deviations (std) from 2â€“3 biological replicates
  (BRs), each with approximately 100 single cells analyzed through time-lapse microscopy.
