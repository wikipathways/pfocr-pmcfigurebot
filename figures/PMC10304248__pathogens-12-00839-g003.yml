caption: Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the necrotic-like cell death modulation. The
  mycobacteria or its virulence factors may modulate pyroptosis, necroptosis, and
  ferroptosis pathways at different levels as inducers (red arrows) or inhibitors
  (black inhibitors). For example, Mtb through ESAT-6, LpqH activates inflammasome,
  favoring pyroptosis, while Zmp1 and PknF inhibit it. The Mtb ESX-1 secretion system,
  secreted protein ESAT-6, TNT, and PDIM lipid induce necroptosis. Meanwhile, multiple
  factors inhibit or activate ferroptosis, including the HO-1 enzyme, the SOCS1 protein,
  and the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway, which act at different levels and points
  regulating the cell death pathway. PtpA favors ferroptosis by inhibiting GPX4 expression,
  a ferroptosis regulator
