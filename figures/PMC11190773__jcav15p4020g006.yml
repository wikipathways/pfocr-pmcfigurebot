figure_title: (A) The t-SNE plot demonstrating main cell types in normal and EC samples.
caption: (A) The t-SNE plot demonstrating main cell types in normal and EC samples.
  (B) Expression patterns of canonical specific markers in each cell type. Each dot
  represents a gene, of which the colour saturation indicates the average expression
  level, and the size indicates the percentage of cells expressing the gene. (C-E)
  The t-SNE plot shows the expression levels of MMP-14, MMP-7, MMP-2 in normal and
  EC samples, respectively. (F) Percentage of MMPs gene in each cell type. (G) The
  distribution of up- and down-regulated genes of DEG in each cell type. (H) Correlations
  between MMP score and the classical biological gene signatures in EC using Spearman
  analysis. The negative correlation was marked with blue and positive correlation
  with red. (I) Correlation between the MMP-14 and epithelial cells proliferation
  (r=0.29, P < 0.001, Spearman correlation analysis). (J) Correlation between the
  MMP-2 and WNT signalling pathway (r = 0.29, P < 0.001, Spearman correlation analysis).
  (K) Correlation between the MMP-7 and P53 mediated pathway (r = 0.42, P < 0.001,
  Spearman correlation analysis). t-SNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding
