figure_title: MEP pathway in herbaceous peony.
caption: MEP pathway in herbaceous peony. The numbers 1âˆ’17 represent 17 cultivars,
  and numbers assigned are described in Figure 2. (A) Expression pattern of genes
  involved in the MEP pathway of herbaceous peony. Gene expression levels in different
  cultivars are represented by color gradations. (B) The relative contents of monoterpenes,
  citronellol, linalool, and geraniol in 11 cultivars. The detailed data are sourced
  from Figure 4 and Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S4. (C) Correlation heat map
  between monoterpenes release and gene expression levels. Correlation levels are
  represented by color gradations. (D) Correlation heat map between citronellol, linalool,
  and geraniol releases and TPS gene expression levels. Correlation levels are represented
  by color gradations. Three biological replicates of the experiments were carried
  out
