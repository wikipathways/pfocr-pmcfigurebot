caption: IFN-γ cooperates with AT-II suppressed migration and invasion of CRC cells.
  (A-B) Transwell assays showed that the combination of IFN-γ and AT-II significantly
  inhibited the migration and invasion of HT29 and HCT15 cells. Scale bar, 50 μm.
  (C) The levels of migration-associated genes slug, zeb1, foxc-1, and twist1 in CRC
  cells were assessed using qRT-PCR. (D) Protein expression levels of migration and
  invasion-related proteins MMP2, MMP9, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin were detected by
  Western blotting analysis. All the data are shown as the mean ± SD. ▲P<0.05, ▲▲P<0.01,
  vs. Control group. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, vs. IFN-γ group.
article_title: Atractylenolide II combined with Interferon-γ synergistically ameliorates
  colorectal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro by blocking the NF-kB p65/PD-L1
  pathway.
