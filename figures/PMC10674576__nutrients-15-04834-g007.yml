figure_title: VDR upregulates NHE8 expression by suppressing NF-κb p65 signaling pathway
  in colitis.
caption: 'VDR upregulates NHE8 expression by suppressing NF-κb p65 signaling pathway
  in colitis. The white rectangles show the enlarged part. (A): Representative immunofluorescence
  staining for colonic pp65 proteins in control mice (CT), VitD-sufficient mice with
  DSS-induced colitis (DSS) and VitD-deficient colitis mice (VDd + DSS). (B): Representative
  immunofluorescence staining for pp65 proteins in wild-type mice (WT), wild-type
  mice with DSS-induced colitis (WT + DSS) and VDR−/− mice with DSS-induced colitis
  mice (VDR−/− + DSS). Red: pp65; blue: cell nucleus. (C): Western blot detection
  of phosphorylated NF-κb p65 (pp65) and total NF-κb p65 (p65) proteins in Caco-2
  cells. (D): Western blot detection of NHE8 protein expression of Caco-2 cells in
  each group. (E): Intestinal enteroids extraction and culture in vitro. (F): Representative
  immunofluorescence staining for NHE8 (green) and pp65 (red) proteins in 3D-organoids
  of WT and VDR−/− mice. Vehicle: control cells; TNF: vehicle and TNF-α treated cells;
  TNF + QNZ: QNZ and TNF-α co-treated cells; TNF + siVDR: VDR siRNA transfected and
  TNF-α treated cells; TNF + siVDR + QNZ: QNZ and TNF-α co-treated cells with VDR
  siRNA pre-transfection. WT: wild-type enteroids. VDR−/−: VDR−/− enteroids. * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 for statistical significance'
