figure_title: Interaction between trophoblast cells and immune cells.
caption: Interaction between trophoblast cells and immune cells. (A) Violin plot showing
  the expression patterns of signaling genes involved in the CALCR signaling network.
  Normalized expression levels are shown in a violin plot. Red represents the NC group
  and blue represents the RM group. (B) Circle plot showing the CALCR signaling pathway
  network in cells from maternal-fetal interface in NC and RM groups. The thicker
  the line, the stronger the interaction weights/strength between the two cell types.
  (C) Comparison of the contributions of the ligand-receptor pairs in the CALCR signaling
  pathway network between NC and RM groups. (D) Violin plot showing the expression
  patterns of the signaling genes involved in the CDH signaling network. Normalized
  expression levels are shown in the violin plot. Red represents the NC group and
  blue represents the RM group. (E) Circle plot showing the CDH signaling pathway
  network in cells from maternal-fetal interface in NC and RM groups. The thicker
  the line represented, the stronger the interaction weights/strength between the
  two cell types. (F) Comparison of the contributions of ligand-receptor pairs in
  the CDH signaling pathway network between NC and RM groups. (G) Violin plot showing
  the expression patterns of signaling genes involved in the PVR signaling network.
  Normalized expression levels are shown in the violin plot. Red represents the NC
  group and blue represents the RM group. (H) Circle plot showing the PVR signaling
  pathway network in cells from maternal-fetal interface in NC and RM groups. The
  thicker the line represented, the stronger the interaction weights/strength between
  the two cell types. (I) Comparison of the contributions of ligand-receptor pairs
  in the PVR signaling pathway network between NC and RM groups. (J) Dot plot exhibited
  incoming communication patterns of placental trophoblast cells and decidual immune
  cells
