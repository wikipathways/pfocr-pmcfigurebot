  diseases.
caption: 'The different roles of the cGAS–STING pathway in host defense and various
  diseases. (A) The role of the cGAS–STING pathway in host defense. The genome of
  invading pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria and parasites, in the cytosol can
  be sensed by cGAS, triggering the cGAS–STING pathway-induced production of type-I
  IFN and other cytokines to eliminate the genomes of invading pathogens. (B) The
  role of the cGAS–STING pathway in ALS. The missense mutation in the TDP-43 protein
  enables its absorption into the mitochondria and causes mtDNA leakage into the cytosol,
  prompting overproduction of type-I IFN and NF-κB to initiate hyperinflammatory responses.
  (C) The role of the cGAS–STING pathway in HD. The mutation of the N-terminal polyglutamine
  in the huntingtin protein (mHTT) leads to the abnormal accumulation of damaged DNA
  in the brain’s striatum, initiating the STING-dependent type-I IFN production and
  autophagy. (D) The role of the cGAS–STING pathway in MI. Synchronously dying cells
  are sensed by cardiac macrophages, and damaged DNA from these cells is internalized
  by cardiac macrophages. Furthermore, this internalization process leads to the inhibition
  of the transformation of cardiac macrophages from inflammatory cells to a reparative
  phenotype via the activation of the cGAS–STING pathway. (E) The role of the cGAS–STING
  pathway in AP. Damaged DNA released by the dying pancreatic acinar cells is internalized
  by leukocytes, resulting in severe inflammation due to the cGAS–STING pathway-induced
  overproduction of type-I IFN and other cytokines. (F) The role of the cGAS–STING
  pathway in silicosis. Silica microparticles invade the lungs, causing an increased
  release of chromatin fragments and mtDNA from dying cells into the BALF. These chromatin
  fragments and mtDNA then engage the cGAS–STING pathway to increase type-I IFN and
  other cytokine levels, causing chronic progressive fibrotic inflammation in the
  lungs. (G) The role of the cGAS–STING pathway in NASH and liver IRI. Lipotoxicity
  in NASH and ROS in IRI both lead to mitochondrial stress and the release of mtDNA
  into the cytosol of Kupffer cells. Furthermore, these changes result in adipose
  tissue inflammation via the cGAS–STING pathway and cGAS–STING–NLRP3 inflammasome-driven
  cell death in NASH and IRI, respectively. (H) The role of the cGAS–STING pathway
  in SLE. The loss-of-function mutation in TREX1 is suggested as the main cause of
  SLE. TREXI mutations lead to the abnormal accumulation of cytosolic DNA, which continuously
  activates the type-I IFN signaling cascade and amplifies inflammation via cGAS–STING.
  (I) The role of the cGAS–STING pathway in AGS. The loss-of-function mutation in
  TREX1 and the RNaseH2 complex are considered the major components of AGS. In this
  context, mutations in TREX1 and the RNaseH2 complex lead to the failure to eliminate
  genomic fragments in the cytosol and maintain genome stability, causing increased
  cGAS–STING pathway-dependent expression of type-I IFN. (J) The role of the cGAS–STING
  pathway in COPA, SAVI, and FCL. COPA is caused by the abnormal accumulation of STING
  in the GR. SAVI is attributed to the gain-of-function mutation in the STING-encoding
  gene, which leads to the spontaneous translocation of STING from the ER to the GR.
  This abnormal translocation activates intensive type-I IFN signals independently
  of cGAMP stimulation. Finally, FCL is caused by the heterozygous gain-of-function
  mutation in STING, resulting in the spontaneous dimerization of STING and constitutive
  activation of the type-I IFN signature. (K) The role of the cGAS–STING pathway in
  RA. The abnormal accumulation of cytosolic DNA leads to the expression of cytokines
  and chemokines via cGAS–STING activation, contributing to RA development. (L) The
  role of the cGAS–STING pathway in neurodegeneration. In microglia, mtDNA in the
  cytosol of microglia contributes to the chronic inflammatory response, which leads
  to neurodegeneration. Abbreviations: ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; MT stress,
