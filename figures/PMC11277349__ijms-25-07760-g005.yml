caption: Proposed synthesis pathway for CA and associated genes in suspension cells
  treated with 0.5 mmol·L−1 HQ for 12 h. (a) Potential syntheyic route of CA (b) Main
  KEGG pathways of DEGs positively correlated to CA synthesis (correlation coefficients
  > 0.9 and p value < 0.01). (c) 13 DEGs correlated significantly with CA synthesis
  (correlation coefficients > 0.995 and p value < 0.01)
