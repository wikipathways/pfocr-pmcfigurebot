caption: 'Differential gene analysis before and 1 month (1 M) after MWA. 27 differential
  genes (a) enriched in toll-like receptor-related signaling pathways (b). GSEA showed
  NF-kappa B-TNFα signaling pathway consistent with GO analysis (c). GSEA: gene set
  enrichment analysis; GO: gene ontology; MWA: microwave ablation'
