  DEGs expression analysis.
caption: 'The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene ontology (GO) and DEGs
  expression analysis. (a) The number of DEGs identified in two mangrove varieties
  in response to chilling stress. (b) The most significantly expressed genes with
  more than eightfold change in K. obovata and A. marina under chilling stress. (c)
  GO enrichment of DEGs in K. obovata. (d) GO enrichment of DEGs in A. marina. (e)
  The 43 DEGs co-regulated K. obovata and A. marina in the oxidation-reduction process
  (GO: 0055114). (f) DEGs co-expressed in the A. marina and K. obovata in the photosynthesis
  pathway'
