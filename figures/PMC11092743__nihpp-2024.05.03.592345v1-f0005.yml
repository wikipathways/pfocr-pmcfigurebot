caption: 'Growth effects of IGF-1-AKT signaling in the KPC cell line and role of cholesterol
  metabolism. (A) Colony formation assay of parental KPC and Akt1/2/3KO cells cultured
  in the indicated conditions. 10,000 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and treatment
  started on day #2 by replacing the media with either DMEM with PBS, DMEM containing
  100ng/ml EGF or 100ng/ml IGF-1 or 100ng/ml EGF plus 100ng/ml IGF-1, or 10% FBS.
  The media were replaced every day and cells were stained with crystal violet on
  day #5. The quantification of crystal-violet-positive area with Image J is shown
  on the right, two-way ANOVA was performed followed by Šídák''s multiple comparisons
  test for every possible pair. Only the selected pairs are shown. * P < 0.05, **
  P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.001 (B) Heatmap of all genes above threshold
  by RNA-seq analysis of KPC and Akt1/2/3KO (n=3). The experiment was conducted with
  triplicates of cells of three different passages. The color scale for the z-score
  is shown on the right. (C)GSEA pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially
  expressed genes between KPC and Akt1/2/3KO cell lines and subsequent visualization
  by EnrichmentMap in Cytoscape show a cluster of interconnected pathways related
  to cholesterol metabolism. (D) The transcript levels of key genes involved in the
  cholesterol synthesis pathway. T-tests were performed. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01,
  *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001. Srebf2 is a master regulator of cholesterol metabolism.
  Hmgcs1 and Hmgcr encode the rate-limiting enzymes in the mevalonate pathway. Ldlr
  encodes low-density lipoprotein receptor, responsible for cholesterol uptake. (E)
  Protein-mass-normalized whole-cell cholesterol levels were measured by the Amplex
  Red assay of KPC and Akt1/2/3KO cells in the indicated conditions. Two-way ANOVA
  (P<0.05 for the interaction H0) was performed, followed by an uncorrected Fisher''s
  LSD test. ** P < 0.01.'
