  target gene expression.
caption: 'The role of IL-6R interaction with gp130 for Stat3-mediated inflammatory
  target gene expression. Gp130 chain dimerization by the IL-6-IL6R complex stimulates
  the non-overlapping intracellular signaling pathway via phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic
  region of gp130 linked with the Janus kinase family. Abbreviations: IL-6, interlukin-6;
  IL-6R, interlukin-6 receptor; gp130, glycoprotein 130'
