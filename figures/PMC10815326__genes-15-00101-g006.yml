  Oxygen Species pathway.
caption: Gene set enrichment analysis of the Reactome Detoxification of Reactive Oxygen
  Species pathway. (A,C) Detoxification of Reactive Oxygen Species is not enriched
  in cerebellum versus ccerebral cortex in presymptomatic Npc1−/− mice (A) and wildtype
  controls (C). (B,D) Comparisons between Npc1−/− and wildtype mice show gene set
  enrichment in the cerebral cortex of Npc1−/− mice (D) but not in the cerebellum
  (B) ES = enrichment score; NES = normalized enrichment score; FDR-q = False discovery
