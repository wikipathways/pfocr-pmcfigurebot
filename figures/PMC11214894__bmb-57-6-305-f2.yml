caption: 'Effects of PLST downregulation on cell migration, invasion and morphological
  changes in H460 and H1299 cells. (A) The cells were transfected with 10 nM NC siRNA
  or 100 nM PLST siRNA using LipofectaminTM 3000 reagent. Then, qRT-PCR was performed
  to substantiate the mRNA expression level of PLST. (B) Western blotting analysis
  was performed to substantiate the protein expression level of PLST. (C) Wound healing
  assay was performed to measure migratory ability by PLST knockdown in H460 and H1299
  cells. Wound healing process was observed using a microscope. Quantitative analysis
  of decrease in wound-healing ability by PLST knockdown in H460 and H1299 cells.
  Scale bar: 100 μm. (D) Cell migration assay was performed to examine cell migratory
  ability by PLST knockdown using a Boyden chamber in H460 and H1299 cells. The migrated
  cells on the bottom surface of membrane were observed using a microscope. Quantitative
  analysis of decrease of migrated cell number by PLST knockdown in H460 and H1299
  cells. Scale bar: 100 μm. (E) Cell invasion assay was performed to determine cell
  invasive ability by PLST knockdown using a Boyden chamber in H460 and H1299 cells.
  The invaded cells on the bottom surface of membrane were observed using a microscope.
  Quantitative analysis of decrease of invaded cell number by PLST overexpression
  in H460 and H1299 cells. Scale bar: 100 μm. (F) F-actin staining assay was performed
  to examine the cell morphological change of H460 and H1299 cells by PLST knockdown.
  Scale bar: 50 μm. These results are the average of three independent experiments.
  Data are represented as mean ± SD (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).'
