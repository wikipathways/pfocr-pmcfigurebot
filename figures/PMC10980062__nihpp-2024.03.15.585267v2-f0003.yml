figure_title: Broadly dysregulated processes in AD
caption: (a—c). Heatmaps representing select Gene Ontology biological processes dysregulated
  in more than one cell type (nominal P < 0.05). Shared alterations are indicated
  as evidence of dysregulation in multiple cell types, with red representing upregulation
  and blue for downregulation. Pathways discussed in the Article are highlighted in
  bold text. (d—f), Upset plots displaying the broadly dysregulated pathways. (g—i),
  Selected pathways exhibiting different dysregulation patterns across cell types.
