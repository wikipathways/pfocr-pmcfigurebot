figure_title: The role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in unhealthy lifestyle-related
  ovarian aging.
caption: 'The role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in unhealthy lifestyle-related ovarian
  aging. CSE induces a cytostatic effect regulated by cell-cycle associated genes,
  and leads to oxidative stress via the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, eventually resulting in
  the death of ovarian cells. Some of the material in the image was sourced from BioRender.com,
  accessed on 24 July 2023. The red line represents inhibition and the black line
  represents promotion. endoplasmic reticulum: ER'
