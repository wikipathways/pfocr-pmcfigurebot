figure_title: Fibroblasts from ILD biopsies have higher TGF-β signaling than fibroblasts
  from ILD explants
caption: (A) Schematic of processing diagnostic lung biopsies of ILD patients. (B)
  Dimensional reduction plot of fibroblasts from donor (13,856 cells, n = 13), ILD
  biopsy (7,724 cells, n = 3), and IPF explant (21,192 cells, n = 26) samples. (C)
  Fibroblast subtype composition by sample type. (D and E) Volcano plots of differentially
  expressed (D.E.) genes in all fibroblasts from ILD biopsy samples versus donor samples
  and ILD biopsy samples versus IPF explant samples, with selected TGF-β pathway–related
  genes labeled. (F) Violin plot of selected TGF-β1–related genes in all fibroblasts.
  (G) Single-cell activity of hallmark TGF-β pathway in all fibroblasts. (H) Heatmap
  of z scores from pairwise upstream IPA of differentially expressed genes from all
  fibroblasts. Statistical significance was determined by 2-tailed t test (C, F, and
  G) and MAST with adjustment for multiple comparisons (D and E)
