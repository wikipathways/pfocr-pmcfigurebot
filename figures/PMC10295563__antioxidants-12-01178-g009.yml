caption: Cellular senescence signaling pathway in chronological (natural) aging. Replicative
  senescence and telomere shortening trigger DNA damage response, which activates
  cellular senescence pathways, either through the p16INK4A/pRb or p53/p21 pathway.
  Both p16INK4A and p21 are cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors that bind directly
  to different CDK proteins; p16INK4A specifically binds to CDK4 and CDK6, whereas
  p21 allows the binding of wider types of CDK. Further, p16INK4A-CDK or p21-CDK complex
  leads to dephosphorylation of pRb, and under this hypophosphorylated state, pRb
  binds E2F (a transcription factor for G1 to S phase in cell cycle progression),
  resulting in cell cycle arrest and senescent cell accumulation. Senescent cells
  can neither proliferate nor involve in cell repair, yet they remain metabolically
  active and disrupt normal cells by secreting senescence-associated secretory phenotypes
  (SASPs), such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [2,50]. In age-related
  cellular senescence, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, chemokine
  C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), and chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2)
  are considered as major pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [5,6]. p in yellow
  circle illustrates phosphate. CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; pRb, retinoblastoma
