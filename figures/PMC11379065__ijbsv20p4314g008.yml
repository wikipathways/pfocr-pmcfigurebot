caption: Senomorphic therapy with Rux regulates mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial-mediated
  apoptosis by inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. (A,B) Representative Western
  blot bands and quantitative analysis of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in NRCMs treated with
  Rux or not post LPS stimulation compared with the control group. N = 4. (C,D) Representative
  Western blot bands and quantitative analysis of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in mouse hearts
  treated with 30 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg of Rux or saline post LPS injection compared
  with the Sham group. N = 4. (E,F) Representative Western blot bands and quantitative
  analysis of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in mouse hearts treated with 30 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg
  of Rux or saline post CLP surgery compared with the Sham group. N = 4. (G,H) Representative
  Western blot bands and quantitative analysis of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 after reactivating
  the JAK2-STAT3 pathway using r-IL6 in NRCMs. N = 4. (I,J) Representative Western
  blot bands and quantitative analysis of p-Drp1, Fis1, Mfn2 and Opa1 after reactivating
  the JAK2-STAT3 pathway using r-IL6 in NRCMs. N = 4. (K,L) Representative fluorescence
  images and quantitative analysis of ROS and MitoSox after reactivating the JAK2-STAT3
  pathway using r-IL6 in NRCMs. Scale bar = 20 μm, N = 4. (M,N) Representative Western
  blot bands and quantitative analysis of Bax, Cleaved-cas3, Bcl2 and Cyto-c after
  reactivating the JAK2-STAT3 pathway using r-IL6 in NRCMs. N = 4. Data are presented
  as mean ± SD. * P<0.05, ** P<0.01, *** P<0.001, **** P<0.0001. LPS, Lipopolysaccharide;
  Rux, ruxolitinib; Con, control; Cyto-c, Cytochrome c; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  r-IL6, recombinant IL-6; NRCMs, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
