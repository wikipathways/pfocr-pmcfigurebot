caption: The MIF/CD74 axis is enriched in interactions between malignant cells and
  other cells. (A) Circular diagram representing signaling pathways originating from
  each cell type. (B) Dot plot highlighting significant interactions (L-R pairs) between
  malignant cells and other cell types. (C) Roles of cell types in the MIF signaling
  pathway. (D) Heatmap depicting the expression of key genes in the MIF signaling
  pathway across cell types. (E) Boxplot illustrating the expression of the MIF gene
  in tumor and adjacent tissues in TCGA-LIHC cohort
