caption: 'LL37 from Mets can activate the downstream NF-κB pathway by interacting
  with P2X7R. (a) Representative images of Co-IP. Cell lysates of spinal cord injured
  tissues were immunoprecipitated with anti-LL37 and then immunoblotted with anti-P2X7R
  and anti-LL37. Rabbit anti-IgG was used as a negative control. Co-IP: Co-Immunoprecipitation.
  (b) Typical immunoblots of LL37, P2X7R, p-NF-κB, and NF-κB in the injured area of
  each group at 7 days after the operation. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (c,
  d) Scatterplot of the relative OD of LL37, P2X7R, and p-NF-κB/NF-κB in each group.
  Data are presented as Mean ± SD(n = 6).  ∗P < 0.05 vs. Sham group; #P < 0.05 vs.
  SCI group (one-way analysis of variance followed by the least significant difference
  test).'
