caption: Association analysis of differential genes and differential metabolites.
  (A) Heatmap of p values for common pathways in the transcriptome and metabolism.
  (B) FPKM values for differential genes in the jasmonic acid signaling pathway. (C)
  FPKM values for the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway and its associated genes.
  Circles represent substances; rectangles represent genes, arrows indicate transitions
  between substances or pathways for signaling. (D) FPKM values for the auxin signaling
  pathway and its differentially expressed genes
