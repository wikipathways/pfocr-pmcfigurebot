figure_title: Transcriptomic data highlight Thr regulation of lipid metabolism.
caption: Transcriptomic data highlight Thr regulation of lipid metabolism. (A) PCA
  of RNA-seq data after treatment with 0 and 25 μM Thr. (B) Differential gene heat
  map. (C) Volcano plot of differential genes. (D) Top twenty KEGG pathways enrichment
  plot of differential genes. (E) GO enrichment analysis. (F) JAK-STAT signaling pathway
  differential gene heatmap. (G) PPAR signaling pathway differential gene heatmap.
  (H) Arachidonic acid metabolism pathway differential gene heatmap. (I) qPCR validation
  of sequencing data. Data are means ± SEM; n = 3–6 biologically independent replicates
  obtained from independent experiments (represented by white circles). a–d Different
  letters indicate significant differences between groups (p < 0.05)
