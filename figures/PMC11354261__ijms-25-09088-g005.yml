figure_title: Human conditionally immortalized podocytes were put under mechanical
  stress.
caption: Human conditionally immortalized podocytes were put under mechanical stress.
  (A) Immunostaining for LC3 puncta and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)—binding
  to DNA and presenting nucleus was performed at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h and visualised
  under confocal microscope (magnification ×1200). LC3 dots are most prominent in
  the perinuclear and cytoplasmic regions (white arrows in merged images). LC3 puncta
  staining is lower at 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, suggesting lower autophagy under mechanical
  stress. (B) Quantification of LC3 puncta staining showing statistically significant
  reduction at 24 h and 48 h (b) and statistically non-significant reduction at 12
  h (a) [96]. »Reproduced with permission from Li et al., Spironolactone promotes
