figure_title: F‐domain valency determines level of activation of AKT phosphorylation
caption: 'A–LSerum‐starved HUVECs were stimulated with designed scaffolds normalized
  to 18 nM of F‐domains for 15 min and analyzed by immunoblotting for pAKT (S473),
  pERK1/2 (T202/Y204), and pFAK (Y397) phosphorylations. (A, E, I) pAKT, (B, F, J)
  pERK1/2, and (C, G, K) pFAK phosphorylation levels were quantified and normalized
  to Icos‐cage signaling levels. Appendix Fig  shows the detection of two bands expected
  for pERK1/2. Representative immunoblot gels of cells stimulated with or without
  scaffolds at 18 nM of F‐domain: (D) helical bundles, (H) trimeric and tetrameric
  homo‐oligomers and tetrahedral nanocages, (L) Icosahedral nanocages and trimeric
  subunit.M–PDose–response curves, EC50, and EMAX for pAKT and pERK1/2 activation.
  The curves, EC50 and EMAX values are calculated using Prism, GraphPad. (N, P) Darker
  red color indicates lower EC50 and higher EMAX values.Q, RQuantification (Q) and
  representative gel (R) for Tie2 knockdown using 40 nM of siRNA before starvation
  and F‐domain scaffold at 18 nM of F‐domain or PBS stimulation.S, TQuantification
  (S) and representative gel (T) for inhibition of Ang1‐dependent pAKT signaling by
  Ang2, H3, Tet1‐A, or Icos1‐A; pAKT band intensities were normalized to Ang1‐dependent
  pAKT level). Representative immunoblots for H3, Tet1‐A, and Icos1‐A competition
  experiments are in Appendix Fig . Quantification of pERK1/2 and pFAK level for the
  competition assay is in Appendix Fig . Partial valency analysis of icosahedral nanocages
  is in Appendix Fig . Data information: Each point on all graphs represents a biological
  replicate, n > 3, bars represent the mean ± SEM. One‐way ANOVA with Bonferroni test
  was used for multiple comparisons to calculate P‐values. (****) indicates P < 0.0001.
  P‐values are also indicated in Appendix Table .'
