  and insulin secretion.
caption: FOXM1/PLK1/CENP-A pathway regulates the cell cycle progression of β-cells
  and insulin secretion. The insulin signaling pathway promotes the DNA-binding activity
  of FOXM1 and regulates the expression of CENP-A and Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1) by
  regulating cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2. β-cell mitotic cell cycle progression and
  insulin secretion are regulated by the insulin-FOXM1/PLK1/CENP-A pathway
