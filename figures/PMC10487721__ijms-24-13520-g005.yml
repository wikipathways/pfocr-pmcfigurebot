figure_title: Expression of key genes in aliphatic glucosinolate metabolic pathway
  under normal sulfur (+S) and sulfur deficiency (−S) conditions.
caption: Expression of key genes in aliphatic glucosinolate metabolic pathway under
  normal sulfur (+S) and sulfur deficiency (−S) conditions. (A) Schematic diagram
  of aliphatic glucosinolate metabolic pathway. Met, methionine; GSLs, glucosinolates.
  Metabolites are depicted in black. Transcription factors (MYB28, MYB29 and MYB76)
  and enzymes are depicted in brown. (B) Relative expression level of genes of aliphatic
  glucosinolate metabolic pathway in WT, 35S::BoLSU1 and 35S::BoLSU2. Scatter plots
  indicate three biological replicates. Different letters indicate significant differences
  (Tukey’s post hoc test, p < 0.05)
