caption: Correlation analysis of GADD45B and SERPINE1 with prognosis in patients with
  GC. (a) Expression heatmap of p53 signaling pathway-related genes in association
  with clinicopathological characteristics of GC patients. (b) Heatmap of expression
  of high-risk genes GADD45B and SERPINE1 in association with prognosis in patients
  with GC. (c) Box plot of expression of high-risk genes GADD45B and SERPINE1 in GC
  samples (red indicates adjacent normal tissue samples, and blue indicates GC tissue
  samples). (d) Network diagram of the interaction between GADD45B gene and other
  DEGs. (e) A network diagram of the interaction between the SERPINE1 gene and other
  DEGs
