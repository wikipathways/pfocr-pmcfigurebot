figure_title: Curcumin downregulates inflammation-related pathways in aged mice.
caption: Curcumin downregulates inflammation-related pathways in aged mice. (A) Phosphorylated
  and total p65 nuclear and cytoplasmic protein expression levels in the liver tissue
  lysates. The results are expressed as mean ± SEM (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). (B)
  Heatmap of inflammation-related mRNA expression measured using FPKM (p < 0.05 in
  HFHSD comparison; FPKM > 1.5) from the senescence pathway based on the GO term and
  KEGG analysis (red indicates a positive Z-score, and green indicates a negative
  Z-score) (left), and a bar chart of the genes with the most significant fold changes
  associated with the inflammation pathways based on the IPA presented with the Z-scores
  (red indicates activation and blue indicates suppression) (right)
