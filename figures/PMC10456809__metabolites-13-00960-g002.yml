caption: Specnuezhenide (SPN) regulated the metabolic profile and bile acid (BA) compositions.
  (A) The plot depicts separation of the principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal
  partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS−DA) of serum from different groups
  at positive and negative modes. (B) Metabolic pathway analysis of identified potential
  marker. (C) Untargeted metabolomic analyses of serum, liver, and feces were performed
  to measure the concentration of total BAs (n = 5). Data are expressed as mean ±
  SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with the model (MOD) group
