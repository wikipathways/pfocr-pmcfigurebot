figure_title: HBV-HCC pathways of top 10 downregulated miRNAs.
caption: HBV-HCC pathways of top 10 downregulated miRNAs. In the HBx dysregulated
  HBV-HCC pathways, the top 10 downregulated miRNAs modulate expression in the TGF-B/SMAD
  pathway by targeting validated gene targets like TGFBR1 and SMAD3/CDKN1A/MYC to
  influence both oncogenesis and the loss of tumor suppression. In the P13K/AKT pathway,
  the top 10 downregulated miRNAs target PIK3A and AKT2/CHUK to influence NF-kB1 promotion
  of BCL2 to influence invasion, metastasis and anti-apoptosis, and in the JAK/STAT
  pathway, this miRNA panel targets STAT1/3 to influence hepatocyte proliferation.
  MAPK signaling is targeted by the top 10 downregulated miRNAs by influencing the
  expression of VDAC3/SRC and GRB2/SOS/KRAS to influence the MAP3K/MAP3/JUN and SMAD4
  to influence oncogenesis in the SAPK/JNK. Similarly, MAPK signaling is influenced
  in the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway by this panel of miRNA targeting ARAF/MAP2KT/MAPK1/MYC
  and STAT3 to promote cell proliferation. Validated targets in cell cycle controls
  that are also dysregulated by the HBx protein include TP53/FAS/CDKN1A/CDK2, CCNE1/RBI
  and E2F1 to influence loss of cell cycle controls. See Table 2 and the Discussion
  section for further verification of the validated associations in HBV-HCC pathogenesis
