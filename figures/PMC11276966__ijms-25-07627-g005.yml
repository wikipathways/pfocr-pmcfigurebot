caption: The signaling transduction pathways and functional implications of EPF/EPFL,
  CEP, RALF, LURE, and IDA/IDL. (A) EPFs modulate stomatal development by binding
  to the ER–TMM co-receptor and regulate stamen filament proliferation by interacting
  downstream with the ER–SERK co-receptor. (B) The binding of LURE1 to its receptor
  promotes the growth of pollen tubes. (C) Activation of downstream signaling pathways
  via the binding of RALFs to their receptors regulates the development of pollen
  tubes and the elongation of root cells. (D) AtCEP3 and AtCEP5 interact with CEPRs
  to initiate signaling cascades, thereby modulating lateral root growth. GhCEP46
  binds to CEPRs to inhibit fiber length and plant height. (E) IDA/IDL’s binding with
  the HSL2–SERK co-receptor triggers downstream signal transduction, facilitating
  root cap and inflorescence detachment
