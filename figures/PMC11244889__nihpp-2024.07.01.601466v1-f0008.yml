figure_title: T3SS triggered LTB4 synthesis differs between neutrophils and macrophages
caption: LTB4 synthesis requires an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation
  of MAPK signaling. Activation of MAPK signaling required for LTB4 synthesis appears
  to be independent of the T3SS, and instead is initiated by a currently unknown PAMP
  and signaling pathway(s) (Signal 1). In response to the T3SS (Signal 2), neutrophils
  require Ca2+ signaling through SKAP2/PLC/STIM1 to produce LTB4. Macrophages require
  Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space, with only a partial requirement of STIM1
  but not SKAP2 or PLC. Inflammasome activation is not required in neutrophils for
  LTB4 synthesis but enhances the induction in macrophages. Phagocytosis also enhances
  LTB4 induction in macrophages, but not in neutrophils. Red boxes indicate factors
  involved in LTB4 synthesis examined in this study. Blue boxes indicate potential
  or unknown factors they may be involved but have yet to be tested
