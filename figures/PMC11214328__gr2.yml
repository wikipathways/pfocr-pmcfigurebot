caption: GABA receptor blockade induces abrupt changes in RGC response transience(A)
  Representative ON (left) and OFF (right) RGC light responses (rasters at the top
  and corresponding PSTHs below) are clearly altered when the nonspecific GABA receptor
  blocker PTX was applied (bottom panels of the same RGCs). The observed changes included
  the elimination of a sustained response component (shoulder) for the OFF cell and
  the unmasking of other response components (OFF pathway driven spiking for the ON
  cell and ON pathway driven spiking of the OFF cell, consistent with previous reports.,,.(B)
  The frequency histograms show that the GABA-A blockade decreased the number of RGCs
  with intermediary responses and many RGC responses became transient.(C–E) Apart
  from a handful of cells showing no considerable change, the GABA receptor blockade
  induced an overall decrease of PSTHτ values for most examined ON (left) and many
  OFF (right) RGCs (C). This PTX mediated decrease is also reflected in a drop of
  mean and median PSTHτ values for both ON (left) and OFF (right) RGC subpopulations
  (p < 0.05, paired t-test). Shown are mean values (line), 25% and 75% quartiles (boxes),
  standard deviation (whiskers) (D). Scatterplots show that the GABA-A blockade appeared
  to be more effective on sustained RGC responses that became more transient following
  drug application (positive dimension reflects a transient-to-sustained, whereas
  negative dimension reflects a sustained-to-transient change) (E).
