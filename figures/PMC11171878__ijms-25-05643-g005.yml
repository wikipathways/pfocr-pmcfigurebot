  through modulation of BMP signaling.
caption: Adar regulates male-germline-stem- and progenitor-cell differentiation through
  modulation of BMP signaling. (A) Schematic diagram of the RNA-seq sample preparation
  and process. (B) Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes in a pair-wise
  comparison of W1118 (control) and Adar7. (C) Immunofluorescence images of the testis
  tips of flies carrying nos-Gal4-driven W1118 (control), Adar RNAi, tkv RNAi, and
  Adar RNAi with tkv RNAi in 15 days. Scale bars represent 10 μm. P-Mad (green), FasIII
  (white, hub cells), and Vasa (red) near the hub cell marked GSCs. The white dotted
  line indicates the testis niche. (D) Quantification of the length of TA regions
  in the testis of different genotype flies in 15 days. (E) Quantification of the
  number of GSCs, GBs, and spermatogonia in different genotypes of Drosophila. (F)
  Quantification of the average number of GSCs per testis in different-genotype flies.
  (G) Schematic diagram of ADAR modulation of the BMP signaling pathway in the testis
  of aging Drosophila. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001; ns,
