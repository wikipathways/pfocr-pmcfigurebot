caption: Expression of genes influenced by reovirus infection and NF-κB p65 in the
  brain. Wild-type (WT) and Nsp65−/− newborn mice were inoculated intracranially with
  10 PFU of reovirus T3SA+ or PBS. Cortices were removed at 6 days postinoculation
  and processed for RNA purification and mRNA sequencing. RNA samples prepared from
  infected mice were matched for viral titer. (A) Venn diagram of differential expression
  analysis using DeSeq2 package in R between WT infected versus mock infected (pink)
  and Nsp65−/− infected versus mock infected (blue). (B) Networks with the most differentially
  expressed genes were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. (C) Log2-fold
  change heat map indicating the expression levels of selected genes. The log2-fold
  change was calculated based on the DESeq2 analysis of RNA levels in WT-infected
  brains relative to Nsp65−/−-infected brains.
