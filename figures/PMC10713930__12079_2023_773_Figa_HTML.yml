caption: WNT5A, a WNT gene/protein family member, is naturally secreted by mesenchymal
  stromal cells and contributes to the maintenance of the bone marrow microenvironment.
  WNT5A downregulation is correlated with disease progression and poor prognosis.
  The treatment with Foxy-5, a WNT5A mimetizing compound, counterbalanced several
  leukemogenic processes that are upregulated in leukemia cells, including ROS generation,
  cell proliferation, and autophagy and disruption of PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways
