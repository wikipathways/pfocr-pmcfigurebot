figure_title: Ginsenosides suppress oxidative stress and inhibit OA development through
  activation of the NRF2/ARE signaling pathway.
caption: Ginsenosides suppress oxidative stress and inhibit OA development through
  activation of the NRF2/ARE signaling pathway. Dissociation of Keap1 leads to the
  phosphorylation and activation of NRF2, which enters the nucleus for the transcriptional
  regulation of target genes. OA, osteoarthritis; NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2; ARE, antioxidant responsive elements; Keap1, Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1
