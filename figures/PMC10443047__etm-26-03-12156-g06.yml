caption: EEF1A2 overexpression and Akt signaling pathway activator SC79 can counterbalance
  the inhibition of NSUN6 deficiency on OS progression. (A) Results of reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR showing the expression level of EEF1A2 mRNA in 143b cells of different groups.
  Results of (B) Cell Counting Kit-8, (C) Colony formation, (D) Transwell (scale bar,
  100 µM) and (E) Wound-healing assays (scale bar, 200 µM). Statistical charts of
  (F) Colony formation, (G) Transwell, and (H) Wound-healing assay. ***P#x003C;0.001.
