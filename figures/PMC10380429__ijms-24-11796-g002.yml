caption: Analysis of apoptosis and transcriptome differences between ES-2 and SKOV3
  cells induced by SEC2/ST-4. (A) Antitumor activity of SEC2/ST-4 on SKOV3 and ES-2
  cells. PBMCs were used as effector cells against SKOV3/ES-2 target cells at E:T
  ratios of 10:1. The mixed cells were stimulated with SEC2 or ST-4 at 100 ng/mL and
  incubated for 72 h. The antitumor activity was evaluated with an MTS assay kit.
  The blank wells (RPMI 1640 only), unsettled cell control wells (SKOV3/ES-2 cell
  only), and PBMC-releasing wells (PBMCs and proteins) were used as control. Each
  value indicates the mean ± SD of results obtained from three independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05. (B) DEGs identified in ES-2 and SKOV3 cells after being treated with
  SEC2/ST-4. Histogram shows the number of DEGs compared with the control (ES-2/SKOV3
  cells). All assays were performed in three replicates. (C–F) GO enrichment analysis
  of DEGs in the treated with SEC2/ST-4 group with the control (ES-2/SKOV3 cells)
  group. The most significant GO terms were those with corrected p-value of <0.05.
  The rich factor represents the number of DEGs that exist in this term accounting
  for the total number of genes of this term. (G) Heatmap of DEGs in the apoptosis
  pathway. The vertical axis represents DEGs’ clusters, and the horizontal axis represents
  the clusters of treated and control groups. (H) The transwell co-culture models
  of transcriptome experiment
