figure_title: SIX4 is activated by the IL-6/STAT3 signal.
caption: 'SIX4 is activated by the IL-6/STAT3 signal. (A) After intersection,609 differential
  genes were identified based on the Venn diagram. (B) KEGG analysis: horizontal coordinate
  is the gene ratio; vertical coordinate shows the pathway terms; node size indicates
  the number of genes enriched in the pathway; node color indicates FDR, P<0.05. (C)
  Studies from TCGA database showed the correlation between SIX4 mRNA expression and
  IL-6, JAK1, STAT3''s mRNA. (D) Multiple target genes of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling
  pathway were shown in bar chat. (E) Western blotting showing changes in proteins
  of IL-6, p-STAT3, and SIX4 after stimulating by IL-6. (F) Diagram of wild-type and
  mutant of STAT3 combined with SIX4 promoter region. (G) Chromatin immunoprecipitation
  results were validated by agarose gel electrophoresis analysis. (H) Luciferase reporter
  assays were conducted to assess STAT3 binding to the promoter of SIX4 with or without
  mutant'
