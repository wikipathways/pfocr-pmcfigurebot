figure_title: Co-expression network spectral clustering.
caption: Co-expression network spectral clustering. Gene co-expression networks at
  different MCL stages were constructed using the MRNETB algorithm [25]. Modules of
  co-expressed genes were identified and aligned between networks using a spectral
  clustering approximation approach [23,24]. The union of the aligned modules between
  (A) normal and in situ, (B) in situ and intermediate, (C) intermediate and aggressive
  are depicted. Up- and down-regulated genes are depicted as regular or flipped triangles,
  respectively. The log2 fold change of the co-expression between MCL stages is used
  as a weight of the edges. Loss of co-expression is depicted with green (negative
  log2 fold change), whereas gain of co-expression with red (positive log2 fold change).
  As a result, “green communities” are genes where co-expression relationships are
  weakened as the MCL progresses to the next stage. The node border line color depicts
  the Wiki pathway in which a gene participates. A gene can participate in more than
  one pathway, but here we show only selected pathways (orange = apoptosis, cyan =
  cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, magenta = MAPK signaling pathway, blue = PI3K–Akt
  signaling pathway, yellow = VEGFA–VEGFR2 signaling pathway, brown = cell cycle,
  purple = TGF-beta signaling pathway)
