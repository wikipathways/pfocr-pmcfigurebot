  (A) GA biosynthesis pathway. The third stage of GA biosynthesis follows a distinct metabolic pathway, starting with GA12 or its isomer GA53, which then diverges into two separate pathways. GA12 and GA53 are oxidized to produce inactive intermediates GA9 and GA20, as well as biologically active GAs such as GA1, GA3, GA4, and GA7. Ultimately, GA1 and GA4 are converted into the inactive forms GA8 and GA34, respectively. Red represents bioactive GAs and blue represents inactive GAs. Content of (B) GA7, (C) GA3, (D) GA4, (E) GA1, (F) GA34, and (G) GA8 in R/O and R/M. The statistical significance of mean differences was evaluated using Studentâ€™s t-test, with significance levels denoted as ** p < 0.01 and ns (no significance)
  p > 0.05
