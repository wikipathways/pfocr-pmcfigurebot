caption: Therapeutic cell engineering. (A) Mammalian cells can be designed to receive
  a user-defined output, process it, and response in a programmable, controllable
  and predictable way. (B) Cell types used in synthetic biology-inspired cell-based
  therapies and their properties. (C) Major steps in engineering a therapeutic cell
  including design of a sensor module, a processing platform and a response plan.
  The sensor module consists of various inducers (disease-related biomarkers, chemical
  molecules and physical cues) and a range of receptors (native receptors, chimeric
  receptors, ion channels and switchable proteins) that can be stimulated by the inducers.
  Designer cells process the input signal through an endogenous signaling pathway
  (e.g., the calcium pathway depicted here) or an orthogonal route to produce a biological
  response. The response platform can be designed for slow (e.g., transcription of
  desired gene) or quick (e.g., fast release of pre-formed therapeutic proteins) action
