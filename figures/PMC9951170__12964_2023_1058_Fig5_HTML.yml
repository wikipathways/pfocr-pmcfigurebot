caption: Effects of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded products on AHR signaling pathway in
  Treg cells. EBV-induced production of IL-27 enhances AHR expression, promoting transcriptional
  activity of c-Maf and Foxp3. There is also an interaction between the AHR signaling
  pathway and the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway
