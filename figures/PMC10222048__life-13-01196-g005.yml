caption: 'KEGG pathway analysis of cAMP signaling pathway. (A) Enzymes in red have
  increased expression in the opioid specimens compared to the naïve. Expression of
  the enzymes in blue is decreased. Values are log2-transformed fold-change values
  between the opioid specimens compared with the naïve specimens. (B) Boxplots representing
  the mRNA expression of selected members of cAMP signaling pathway (AKT1; AKT2; CREB1:
  cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1; FOS; HCN2: hyperpolarization-activated
  cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium and sodium channel 2; PAK1: p21 (RAC1)-activated
  kinase 1; PDE10A: phosphodiesterase 10A; PLD2: phospholipase D2; RAC2)'
