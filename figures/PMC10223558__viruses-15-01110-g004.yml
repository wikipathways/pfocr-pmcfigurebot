  after MMTV infection.
caption: 'GSEA enrichment plots depicting negatively and positively enriched pathways
  after MMTV infection. A list of genes retrieved from KEGG pathways was used corresponding
  to the individual pathway listed in this study. (a) Gene sets positively enriched
  in phenotype MMTV. These included: TNF, Autophagy, and Type II interferon pathways.
  (b) Thirteen gene sets were negatively enriched in the MMTV phenotype or positively
  enriched in the CTRL phenotype. These gene sets included: Wnt, Hedgehog, Focal adhesion,
  Rap-1, Hippo, Egfr, Prolactin, PI3-Akt-mTOR, Ras, Metabolism, Inflammation, Glutathione,
  and Vegf signaling pathways. In each graph, the upper green slope corresponds to
  the enrichment score (ES), whereas the lower portion depicts the value of the ranking
  metrics moving down the list of ranked genes. The black vertical lines show the
  location of the genes in the gene sets in the provided list of genes'
