  and quantitative analyses of the proteins p-ERK, ERK, p-p38, p38, p-JNK, JNK, p-c-Jun,
  and c-Jun. The data are presented as means ± SD, with n = 4. Statistical significance
  was determined by using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison tests.
  The following symbols are used to denote statistical significance: # p < 0.05 or
  ## p < 0.01 vs. APP/PS1 group'
