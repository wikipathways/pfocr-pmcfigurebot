caption: High-concentrate diet caused histopathological changes and inflammatory responses
  in the ruminal papilla and ruminal wall. (A) Representative sections of the ruminal
  papillae and wall from two groups. All sections were stained with H&E and observed
  at 40, 200 or 400× magnification. (B) mRNA expression of NF-κB signaling pathway-related
  genes in rumen epithelium. * indicates p < 0.05. HC, high-concentrate group. LC,
  low-concentrate group
