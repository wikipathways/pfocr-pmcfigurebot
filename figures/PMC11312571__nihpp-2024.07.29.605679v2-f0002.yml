figure_title: IMPDH inhibition impairs regeneration and cell proliferation
caption: (A) Simplified pathway diagram of IMPDH2 highlighting regulation by purine
  nucleotides.(B) Schematic of experimental design. Tadpoles are amputated and then
  allowed to regenerate for 72 hours in media supplemented with either vehicle control
  (DMSO) or IMPDH inhibitor (MPA or RBV).(C-E) DIC images of tadpole tails 72 hours
  post amputation (hpa) treated with either 0.05% DMSO, 100 μM MPA, or 500 μM RBV.
  Arrows indicate the plane of amputation.(F-H) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for proliferative
  marker pH3 at 72 hpa. Arrows indicate the plane of amputation.(I-J) Quantification
  of regeneration defects following IMPDH inhibition. Regenerate length (I) and pH3+
  cell density in regenerating tissue (J) normalized to DMSO condition by experimental
  clutch at 72 hpa. Statistical significance between conditions was determined by
  ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD test. *p < 0.05; *** p <0.001
