figure_title: Foliar constitutive gene expression.
caption: 'Foliar constitutive gene expression. (A): Venn diagram of constitutive genes
  differentially expressed between wildtype (WT) and lox2 Arabidopsis thaliana plants
  at two time points (1 and 12 h). Differentially expressed genes between the different
  treatments and times were determined by DESeq2 (p-value (padj) ≤ 0.05 and log2 fold
  change ≥2 or ≤−2). (B): Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and ridgeline plot highlighting
  constitutive metabolic pathways differentially expressed between WT and lox2 plants
  at 1 h. (C): GSEA and ridgeline plot highlighting constitutive metabolic pathways
  differentially expressed between WT and lox2 plants at 12 h. The ridgeline plot
  visualizes the distribution of differential enrichment categories identified by
  GSEA. Significantly differentially expressed pathways in ridgeline plots are indicated
