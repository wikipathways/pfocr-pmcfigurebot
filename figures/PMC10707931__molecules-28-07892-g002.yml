figure_title: (A) K-means analysis of differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs).
caption: (A) K-means analysis of differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs). The
  horizontal coordinate represents the sample name, the vertical coordinate represents
  the content of standardized relative metabolites, and the subclass represents the
  metabolites class number with the same trend. (B) KEGG analysis of the CK and DF14
  libraries. The vertical axis shows the name of the KEGG metabolic pathway, whereas
  the horizontal axis shows the number of metabolites annotated to the pathway and
  its ratio to the total number of annotated metabolites
