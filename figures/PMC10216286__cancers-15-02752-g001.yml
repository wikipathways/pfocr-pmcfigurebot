figure_title: Schematic overview of the TRAIL apoptosis pathway.
caption: Schematic overview of the TRAIL apoptosis pathway. TRAIL induces apoptosis
  by binding to death receptors 4/5. This promotes the trimerization of the death
  receptor, which recruits FADD and pro-caspase 8/10 to form DISC. The latter activates
  caspase 8/10, which activates caspase 3 to induce apoptosis. Caspase 8/10 can also
  convert BID to tBID by cleavage, increasing apoptosis. To accomplish this, tBID
  translocates to the mitochondria, activating BAX/BAK. The formation of mitochondrial
  pores is then mediated by activated BAX/BAK, resulting in the release of cytochrome
  c. An apoptosome is formed when Apaf-1 and pro-caspase 9 bind together. Caspase
  9 is activated, which then activates caspases 3, 6, and 7 to increase apoptosis
