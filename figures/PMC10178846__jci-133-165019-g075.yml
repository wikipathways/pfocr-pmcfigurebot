figure_title: Several CERT1 mutations increase sphingolipid levels
caption: (A) Schematic representation of the de novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway
  with the main enzymes involved (shading indicates the prevalent intracellular localization
  of synthetic reactions). (B) Mass spectrometry profile of sphingolipids in HeLa
  CERT1-KO cells overexpressing selected CERT1 mutants from clusters 1, 2, and 3.
  Values are total levels across the major fatty acid chain lengths of the indicated
  sphingolipids. The levels of individual species are reported in Supplemental Figure
  4A. n = 3. Data are the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, by 1-way
  ANOVA. (C) Effect on the LCB of CERT mutations in HeLa cells. LCB profiles were
  evaluated by incorporation of an isotope labeled (2,3,3-d3,15N)-l-serine. n = 3.
  Data are the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001, by 1-way ANOVA.
  (D) The de novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway as modified by CERT1 mutations
  in clusters 1, 2, and 3. CerS, ceramide synthases; DES, dihydroceramide desaturase;
  SMS1, sphingomyelin synthase 1; UGCG, glucosylceramide synthase; ST3Gal5, GM3 synthase;
  A4GalT, Gb3 synthase; Sph, sphingolipid
