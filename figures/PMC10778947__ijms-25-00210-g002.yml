caption: 'Circus plot representing physical distributions of homozygous single-nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) among the 11 watermelon chromosomes. SNP numbers were calculated
  based on their physical positions in a 1 Mb window size. First tract from inside:
  Distribution of 9520 SNPs (red) within the introgression regions shared by the NB-DAH
  NIL (orange-β-fleshed near-isogenic line) and OTO-DAH NIL (yellow-fleshed near-isogenic
  line). The LCYB gene located in this region is required for the expression of both
  canary yellow and orange flesh. Second tract: Distribution of 31,114 homozygous
  SNPs (blue) between DAH (red-fleshed recipient) and NB-DAH NIL. The genomic regions
  showing a high SNP frequency on chromosome 1 are the possible introgression regions
  from NB5410 (orange-β-fleshed donor for NB-DAH NIL); they, therefore, carry the
  gene(s) for orange-β-flesh. Among the 13 genes in the carotenoid metabolic pathway,
  only PSY1 is located in this region. Third tract: Distribution of 16,755 homozygous
  SNPs between DAH (red-fleshed recipient) and OTO-DAH NIL. The outer track is the
  physical size of each chromosome represented in different colors'
