  signalling pathways.
caption: Metformin likely acts on intervertebral disc degeneration through SIRT-related
  signalling pathways. Metformin reduces ADAMTs and MMPs by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway. Activation of AMPK by metformin reduces COX2 expression by activating
  the SIRT1 and activates the SIRT3 pathway on the other hand, thereby increasing
  PINK1, FOXO3, and mitochondrial activity, and consequently decreasing IL-1Î² and
  ROS levels. Figure adapted from Server Medical Art (https://smart.servier.com/).
