caption: Enrichment analysis and mutation analysis of three subtypes of colorectal
  cancer. (A) The fGSEA plots of the significantly up- or down-regulated hallmark
  gene sets in C3-C1 (Cluster 3- Cluster 1) subtypes. (B) GO BP enrichment analyses
  of genes upregulated in C3 and C1. (C) Violin plots demonstrating the activity of
  five classical cancer-related pathways in three clusters obtained by progeny analysis.
  (D) The waterfall plot showing the mutation distribution of the top 20 most frequently
  mutated genes among three clusters
