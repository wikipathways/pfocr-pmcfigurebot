caption: Target prediction and enrichment analysis results of triterpenoids from E.
  dentata and colon cancer. (A) The flowchart about the targets of triterpenoids and
  the target prediction of colon cancer. (B) The Venn diagram of triterpenoidsâ€”colon
  cancer targets. (C) The PPI network of the intersection target. (D) The GO enrichment
  analysis of the intersection targets. The green, orange, and purple columns respectively
  represent the intersecting targets related to Biological Process (BP), Cellular
  Components (CC), and Molecular Functions (MF). (E) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of common targets. The bubble size represents the number of intersecting targets
  enriched in a signaling pathway while the color of the bubble represents the p-value
