caption: Oxidative stress regulates pea RSA growth. (A) Heat map of peroxidase gene
  expression in the “phenylpropane metabolic pathway”. (B) Heat map of respiratory
  burst oxidase (RBOH) gene expression. (C) POD activity. (D) SOD activity. (E) Endogenous
  H2O2 content. Different lower-case letters are the results of significance analyses
  of Duncan’s multiple range test, indicating statistically significant differences
  (p < 0.05). What is compared here is the significance between different treatments
  at all times. (F) H2O2 staining of primary roots, wherein pea primary roots cultured
  for 72 h were stained in DAB staining solution for 2 h. Photographs were taken to
  observe the staining results. (G) Primary root starch staining, wherein pea primary
  roots cultured for 72 h were stained in Lugol’s iodine solution for 10 min, and
  photographs were taken to observe the staining results
