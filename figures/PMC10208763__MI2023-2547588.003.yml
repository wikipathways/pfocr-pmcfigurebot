caption: (a) Representative images are shown p65 colocalized with Mac2 in the aortic
  sinus lesions of the vehicle control and DMY groups. Scale bar, 100 μm. (b) The
  binding site between miR-9 and SIRT1 was predicted by the TargetScan database. (c)
  qPCR examines the expression of SIRT1 in the tissues. (d–g) Western blot analysis
  of NF-κB signaling pathway in BMDMs in each group (n = 3). ∗P < 0.05
