caption: 'Molecular changes in CTCs using next-generation sequencing in patients with
  HCC treated with atezolizumab and bevacizumab. (A) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
  analysis was conducted on 99 genes exhibiting significant changes in the expression
  of CTCs of patients with HCC (n = 10) before Atezo+Bev treatment and at the initial
  treatment response evaluation. Patients were categorized into two clusters: cluster
  A (n = 6) representing non-responders and cluster B (n = 4) representing responders
  to Atezo+Bev treatment. Pre-treatment patient characteristics, evaluation of initial
  treatment response, and changes in CTC counts are shown. The heatmap illustrates
  the relative expression variation levels of the 99 genes. (B) Kaplan–Meier curves
  illustrating progression-free survival and overall survival for patients in cluster
  A and B. (C) Results of the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the Wikipathways.
  The p-value (−Log2 ratio) for each gene set is shown. Red bars indicate gene sets
  enriched in cluster A with p < 0.05, while blue bars indicate gene sets enriched
  in cluster B with p < 0.05. Light blue bars denote apoptosis-related gene sets with
  p > 0.05. (D) Enrichment indexes of two gene sets depicted in the TGF-β signaling
  pathway (left panel) and TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) signaling
  pathway (right panel). Gene sets were considered significantly enriched at normalized
  enrichment score (NES) >1 or <−1 and nominal p-value < 0.05. (E) Volcano plots showing
  fold changes in expression and p-values of TGF-β signaling pathway-related genes
  (left panel) and apoptosis signaling-related genes (right panel) before Atezo+Bev
  treatment and at the initial response evaluation'
