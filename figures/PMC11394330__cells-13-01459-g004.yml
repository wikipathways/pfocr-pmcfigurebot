caption: Analysis of differentially expressed genes in RNA-seq data of miR-196a-overexpressing
  and NC intramuscular preadipocytes. (A) Volcano map of DEGs in preadipocytes treated
  with miR-196a mimic and mimic NC. Red dot indicates significantly upregulated genes;
  green dot indicates significantly downregulated genes. (B) Heat map of the top 30
  DEGs after overexpressing miR-196a in preadipocytes. Blue colorâ€“red color of band
  represents the expression upregulation of DEGs in miR-196a mimic and mimic NC groups.
  (C) The top 30 enriched pathways of DEGs after miR-196a overexpression in preadipocytes.
  The red boxes indicates that DEGs were involved in two lipid metabolism-related
  signaling pathways, focal adhesion, and the PI3K-Akt pathway
