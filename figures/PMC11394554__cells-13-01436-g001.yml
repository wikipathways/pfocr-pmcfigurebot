caption: Schema illustrates the interaction of the gut and the brain and a few of
  its associated illnesses. OCD—Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, PTSD—Post Traumatic
  Stress Disorder, IBS—Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBD—Inflammatory Bowel Disease, *
  SCFA—Short Chain Fatty Acids, ** Autoinducer-2. Neurotransmitters released by the
  vagus nerve include serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, and norepinephrine. The
  afferent fibers that pass through the nodose ganglia respond to mast cell activation
  as well as mechanoreceptors, gut peptides, neurotransmitters, and microbial metabolites.
  The afferent fibers activated by mast cells lead to the upregulation of CRF and
  CRF1 receptors, as well as the activation of the Crh signaling pathway in the limbic
  system
