caption: 'Schematic representation of the IL-17 signaling pathway: transduction and
  amplification. The IL-17RA and IL-17RC subunits bind to IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17AF
  ligands. The intracellular domains interact with adaptor Act1. Act1 additionally
  contains a TRAF-binding site that enables association with TRAF family proteins.
  Engagement with TRAF6 drives activation of the classical NF-κB, MAPK pathway. Act1
  can also engage other TRAF family proteins to promote a post-transcriptional mRNA
  stabilization pathway. Th17, T helper-17 cells; γδ T cells, gamma delta T cells;
  ILC, innate lymphoid cells; NKT nature killer T cells; TRAF, TNF-receptor associated
  factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; AP-1,
  activator protein; C/EBP, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein'
