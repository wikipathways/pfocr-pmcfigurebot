caption: 'Gene enrichment analysis at 1 day (1 D) and 1 month (1 M) after MWA. GSEA
  showed hypoxic and glycolytic pathways, and NF-kappa B-mediated TNFα downregulation
  consistent with GO analysis at 1 day (a) and 1 month (b) after MWA. GSEA: gene set
  enrichment analysis; GO: gene ontology; MWA: microwave ablation'
