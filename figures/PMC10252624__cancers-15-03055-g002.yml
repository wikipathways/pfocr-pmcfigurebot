caption: The primary mechanisms of ICIs-associated cardiotoxicity. Surface MHCs and
  co-inhibitory molecules including B7 or PD-1 ligands on tumor cells as well as APC
  (e.g., dendritic cells) attach to activated T cells through the TCR, PD-1, and CTLA-4
  receptors. Apoptosis of tumor cells induced by ICI is mediated by the activation
  of T cells. The PD-L1 ligands on cardiomyocytes are hypothesized to be responsible
  for downregulating this pathway in the myocardium. Myocarditis and atherosclerosis
  are the primary outcomes of blocking this regulatory pathway. APC, antigen-presenting
  cell; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; PD-1, programmed cell death 1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand 1; TCR, T-cell
  receptor. Figure 2 was modified from Servier Medical Art (http://smart.servier.com/
