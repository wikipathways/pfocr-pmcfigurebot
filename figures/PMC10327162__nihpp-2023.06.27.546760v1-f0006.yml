figure_title: RsgI’s IDR is required to bypass site-1 autoproteolysis
caption: (A) Schematic models of regulated intramembrane proteolysis of RsgI and the
  RsgIGGG mutant. Detection of cell wall defects by RsgI’s IDR generates a force that
  pulls the autoproteolyzed SEAL domain apart enabling RasP-mediated intramembrane
  proteolysis (Left). The same pulling force unfolds the uncleaved SEALGGG domain,
  which becomes susceptible to an extracytoplasmic protease and/or can access the
  recessed interior of the RasP protease (Right). (B) Immunoblots of strains constitutively
  expressing the indicated GFP-RsgIGGG-His variants in the presence of abence of PBP1.
  Cell were harvested at the indicated times in minutes before and after inhibition
  of protein synthesis with chloramphenicol and spectinomycin. The intrinsically disordered
  region (ID) on RsgIGGG is required to bypass autoproteolysis in the RIP signaling
  pathway. (C) Immunoblots of cell expressing GFP-RsgIGGG-His in the presence or absence
  of RasP. Cell were harvested at the indicated times in minutes before and after
  addition of moenomycin to inhibit PBP1 and chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to
  inhibit protein synthesis. All immunoblots were performed in biological triplicate
  and representative blots are shown
