caption: |-
  SA treatment alters the proteomic pattern of kiwifruit. (A) Scatter plot of the GO enrichment analysis of DEMs associated with SA treatment. The number of proteins in each GO term is represented by the plot size. The plot color indicates the significant differences of each GO term. (B) Volcano plot shows the DEPs with log2fold change ≥ 2 and p ≤ 0.05 in SA vs. control pairwise comparison. Each point in the volcano diagram represents a protein, the horizontal coordinate represents the multiple changes (log2 fold change), and the vertical coordinate represents the p-value of Student’s t-test (−log10
  p-value). The up- and downregulated proteins are shown in red and green, respectively. (C) The pathway enrichment results based on DEPs of kiwifruit in SA vs. control comparison. (D) Heatmap displays the expression levels of resistance genes in kiwifruit after SA treatment and Psa infection. The high and low levels of proteins in each biological replicate are shown in red and blue, respectively
