  Activation of the JAK/SYK signaling pathway in mouse skin tissue sections was done by mice that underwent different treatments (control, model, and model + shTslp-2 treated). Representative immunofluorescence images of expression of (a) phosphorylated JAK (Y1002), (b) phosphorylated SYK (Y348), (c) TRAF6, and (d) phosphorylated NF-κB p65 (S536) in mouse dendritic cells (CD11 expression cells).
  JAK, Janus kinase; SYK, spleen tyrosine kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; TRAF6, anti-TNF receptor-associated factor 6
