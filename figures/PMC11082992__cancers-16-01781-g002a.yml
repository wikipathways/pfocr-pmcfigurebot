caption: Hippo signaling genes or sets of genes frequently found across the Hippo
  pathway signatures were investigated in non-cancerous ovarian tissues and ovarian
  cancer subtypes comprising profiles GSE6008, GSE10971, and GSE12470. (Aâ€“C) The Hippo
  gene set is expressed more predominantly in serous-type ovarian cancers than in
  other subtype tumors. (D) The result of the ontological functional analysis revealed
  that this gene set governs the development of organs and growth. Furthermore, this
  gene set was also examined using gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for additional
  confirmation (Green color indicates the ontology function of the hippo gene set).
  (E,F) The GSEA results show substantial enrichment scores for serous subtype ovarian
  tumors. (N-normal, M-mucinous, E-endometrioid, C-clear cell, S-serous). In (E),
  the red color indicates serous_high grade sample, blue color for normal sample.
  In (F), red color indicates advanced serous sample, blue color for early serous
  sample
