figure_title: The mRNA expression level of IGFBP2 (A) and the representative DEGs
  (B) in the cytokine−cytokine receptor pathway in goose primary hepatocytes transfected
  with siRNA targeting to IGFBP2 (siIGFBP2) versus the negative control siRNA (siNC).
caption: The mRNA expression level of IGFBP2 (A) and the representative DEGs (B) in
  the cytokine−cytokine receptor pathway in goose primary hepatocytes transfected
  with siRNA targeting to IGFBP2 (siIGFBP2) versus the negative control siRNA (siNC).
  The mRNA expression of the genes of interest was determined by qPCR. *, ** denote
  p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 versus the control (siNC), respectively; n = 6. The internal
  reference gene was β-actin and all data are presented as the mean ± SEM
