caption: Altered type II IFN signaling in nicastrin (NCSTN) knockdown HaCaT cells
  and familial AI patient lesion.(A) The upregulated IFN-II pathway in the sequencing
  results of NCSTN knockdown HaCaT cells. Upregulated gene nodes are marked in red,
  downregulated gene nodes are marked in green, and unmarked nodes have no significant
  difference. (B) Western blotting revealed the expression of IFN-II pathway molecules
  (JAK2, STAT1, p-STAT3 and IRF1) in NCSTN knockdown HaCaT cells. The P-STAT3 (C)
  and IRF-1 (D) expressions in the epidermis of the proband patient lesion of a Chinese
  AI family revealed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, respectively.
