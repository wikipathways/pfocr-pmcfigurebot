figure_title: Nitrate signaling regulates flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana.
caption: 'Nitrate signaling regulates flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. N signaling
  as an input to the central circadian clock, by modulating the cellular CRY1 protein
  abundance, affects the expression of key components of the central oscillator. Subsequently,
  as a circadian output, the expression of some flowering genes in the photoperiod
  pathway, such as CO, is altered, and this affects flowering time. Additionally,
  the phosphorylation state of the FBH4 protein can be modulated by N conditions.
  Under low N conditions, FBH4 phosphorylation levels decrease, promoting FBH4 nuclear
  localization and transcriptional activation of the direct target CO and downstream
  florigen FT to accelerate flowering. In another pathway, nitrate availability controls
  bolting and flowering time by modulating SMZ and SNZ gene expression via the GA
  pathway. In the third pathway, nitrate signaling directly integrates into the age
  pathway in a tissue-specific manner. NLP7 and NLP6 directly regulate SPL3 and SPL5
  at the transcriptional level in the SAM. SOC1 is considered the main flowering integrator
  involved in this pathway. Abbreviations: P, phosphorylation; FNR1, FERREDOXIN-NADP
