caption: Effect of IL4I1 on the innate immune response during ARV infection. DF-1
  cells were transfected with pEF1α-Myc-IL4I1 or pEF1α-Myc plasmids and then infected
  with the ARV S1133 strain at an MOI of 1. Expression changes in genes associated
  with the innate immune signaling pathway were detected by real-time PCR (A) 24 h
  postinfection. DF1 cells were transfected with si1357 or siNC and infected with
  the ARV S1133 strain of virus at an MOI of 1. Expression changes in genes associated
  with the innate immune signaling pathway were detected by real-time PCR (B) 24 h
  postinfection. Data are represented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
  Asterisks indicate significant differences (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01)
