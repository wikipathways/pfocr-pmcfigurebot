caption: A schematic diagram depicting the miRNA signaling pathways activated by aldosterone
  through the MR. These miRNAs impact different aspects of the aldosterone and MR
  pathway and subsequent molecular processes, which affect sodium balance, ion transport,
  and the regulation of fibrosis. Red lines represent enhanced expression, whereas
  blue arrows denote repression. Several miRNAs induced by aldosterone might provide
  negative feedback to regulate components of the RAAS signaling pathway. MR, mineralocorticoid
  receptor; ROMK, renal outer medullary potassium; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel;
  ECM, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition
