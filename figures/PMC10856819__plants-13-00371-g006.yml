figure_title: Expression patterns of nitrate signaling pathway genes in wheat.
caption: Expression patterns of nitrate signaling pathway genes in wheat. Nitrate
  is sensed by NRT1.1. The nitrogen signal is transmitted to NLP6/7 via calcium accumulation
  and phosphorylation. NLP6/7 interacts with several TFs to regulate other regulatory
  genes downstream, thereby influencing nitrate uptake, translocation, and assimilation.
