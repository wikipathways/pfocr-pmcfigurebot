figure_title: Overview of AR-V7 and AR splice variants.
caption: 'Overview of AR-V7 and AR splice variants. The androgen receptor (AR) gene,
  located on the X chromosome, comprises eight exons that encode four primary domains:
  The N-terminal domain (NTD), DNA-binding domain (DBD), hinge region (H), and ligand-binding
  domain (LBD). The AR gene can undergo alternative splicing, producing several splice
  variants, each with distinct structures and functions. In the full-length androgen
  receptor (AR-FL), exons 1–8 encode the complete set of domains. However, alternative
  splicing can involve cryptic exons (CE1-4) and exon 9, generating a unique sequence
  (U) not found in AR-FL. AR-V7, also known as AR3, is a significant splice variant
  that terminates at the end of exon 3, lacking the LBD, and includes 16 unique amino
  acids from cryptic exon 3 (CE3). This modification results in AR-V7’s constitutive
  activity, allowing it to activate AR signaling pathways without the need for androgen
  binding. Additionally, other constitutively active AR splice variants, such as ARv567es,
  AR-V3, and AR-V4, are described. Each variant arises from different exon combinations,
  producing unique open reading frames (ORFs) that encode their respective receptor
  proteins'
