figure_title: ACSS2 activity supports cholesterol biosynthesis and glucose uptake
caption: '(A) Heatmap showing gene distance from the transcription start site as a
  measure of accessibility (red, no coverage; blue, maximum coverage). (B) Left: Heatmap
  showing differential gene expression expressed as fold change (downregulated or
  upregulated at least 1.1-fold, adjusted P value ≤ 0.05) between groups with 24-hour
  treatment of 786-O cells with DMSO (blue; n = 3) versus 5 μM ACSS2i (red; n = 3).
  Gene expression clustering on the y axis depicts genes that are upregulated (purple)
  and downregulated (green) in the DMSO group. Middle and right: Bar graphs showing
  transcript counts for genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and
  glycolysis. Statistical significance was determined by multiple unpaired, 2-tailed
  t tests (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.005; ***P < 0.0005). (C) Western blot analysis assessing
  expression of GLUT1 (n = 2), HKII (n = 2), SREBP1 (n = 2), SREBP2 (n = 2), and actin
  (n = 3) in 786-O cells treated with DMSO or 5 μM or 10 μM ACSS2i for 24 hours. (D)
  Bar graph showing total cholesterol levels in 786-O cells treated with DMSO (blue;
  n = 3) or 5 μM ACSS2i (red; n = 3) for 24 hours. Statistical significance was determined
  using an unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s t test (*P < 0.05). (E) Bar graph showing
  measured glucose concentrations in the medium of 786-O cells treated with DMSO or
  5 μM ACSS2i for 0, 24, and 48 hours (n = 3 for all conditions). Statistical significance
  was determined using a 2-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple-comparison test (***P <
  0.0005). Data are represented as mean ± SD'
