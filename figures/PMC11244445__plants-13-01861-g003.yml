caption: Plant metabolic pathways are based on data from flavonoid biosynthesis, carbon
  metabolism, heme biosynthesis, and scopolamine biosynthesis (https://plantcyc.org/,
  accessed on 21 January 2024). The C. annuum database was used. The color scale is
  based on the log2-fold change value (stress/control) for the relative content of
  metabolites and enzymes. The thick black lines indicate the purification and functional
  characterization of the enzymes. In comparison, thin lines indicate that enzymes
  have not been functionally characterized
