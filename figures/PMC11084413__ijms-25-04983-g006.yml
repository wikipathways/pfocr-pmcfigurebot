figure_title: KEGG pathway analysis of carnosic acid downregulated proteins associated
  with citrate cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
caption: KEGG pathway analysis of carnosic acid downregulated proteins associated
  with citrate cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. (A,B), Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)
  pathway and its down-regulated proteins. (C,D), Oxidative phosphorylation pathway
  and its downregulated proteins. The mapping of significantly downregulated proteins
  onto KEGG pathways was performed by ShinyGO software. Downregulated proteins of
  the pathways were labeled blue
