caption: 'Heat stress alters gut microbiota-related metabolites in rainbow trout.
  (A) Volcano plot of differential metabolites in the gut under heat stress. (B) Heat
  map of differential metabolites in the gut under heat stress. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of differential metabolites in the gut under heat stress. (D,E) Spearman
  correlation was used to analyze the association between bacteria and differential
  metabolites (cholesterol): (D) the correlation network diagram of metabolites and
  gut microbiota; (E) the relative expression level of the differential metabolite
  cholesterol. (F,G) Spearman correlation was used to analyze the association between
  bacteria and differential metabolites (choline): (F) the correlation network diagram
  of metabolites and gut microbiota; (G) the relative expression level of the differential
  metabolite choline. Correlation coefficient (CC) > 0.8 or < −0.8. **, p < 0.01 using
  a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s HSD test'
