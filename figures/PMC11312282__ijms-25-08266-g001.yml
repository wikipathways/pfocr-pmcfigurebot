caption: 'Major metabolic pathways and associated enzymes investigated in the study.
  This figure illustrates 12 key biochemical pathways involved in energy production,
  cellular metabolism, and cellular homeostasis: gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, lactate
  shuttle (between neurons and astrocytes), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, electron
  transport chain (ETC), fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, glycogenesis,
  glycogenolysis, urea cycle, and the pentose phosphate/glutathione pathways. Gluconeogenesis,
  glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, part of fatty acid oxidation, glycogenesis, glycogenolysis,
  most of the urea cycle, and the pentose phosphate/glutathione pathways occur in
  the cytoplasm of cells. Gluconeogenesis may additionally occur in the endoplasmic
  reticulum. The TCA cycle, ETC, most of fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and part
  of the urea cycle occurs in the mitochondria within cells. In the brain, the lactate
  shuttle occurs in the extracellular space between neurons and astrocytes. While
  ketogenesis and the urea cycle primarily occur in hepatocytes, astrocytes in the
  brain are also capable of these processes. In the brain, ketogenesis serves as a
  vital alternative energy source during periods of glucose scarcity or increased
  metabolic demands. Ketone bodies, such as β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, are
  synthesized during prolonged fasting or low carbohydrate intake and may cross the
  blood–brain barrier to provide fuel for neurons and other brain cells. This metabolic
  adaptation allows the brain to maintain energy homeostasis and function optimally
  under varying metabolic conditions. This figure highlights the metabolic pathways
  and enzymes of interest in the present study, providing a visual representation
  of the molecular processes under investigation. Enzymes involved in each pathway
  are shown in pink, metabolites are shown in blue, and the rate-limiting enzyme in
  each pathway is shown in orange'
