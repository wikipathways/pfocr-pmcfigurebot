  PH mice lungs.
caption: 'Urolithin A inhibited NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis pathway in hypoxia-induced
  PH mice lungs. (a,b) Western blotting analysis for the protein expression of NLRP3,
  GSDMD, N-GSDMD, IL-1β, and cleaved-Caspase-1 relative to β-actin from lungs of mice
  exposed to normoxia (NOR) or hypoxia with UA (HX + UA) or vehicle (HX) treatment
  (n = 6 per group). (c) Representative immunofluorescence staining of lung tissue
  for α-SMA (greens), Caspase-1 (red) and DAPI (blue) from mice exposed to hypoxia
  with UA or vehicle treatment (n = 6 per group). Scale bars: 50 μm. (d) Quantification
  of the α-SMA+ Caspase-1+ areas. (e) Representative TEM images of pulmonary arterial
  smooth muscle cells of mice exposed to normoxia (NOR) or hypoxia with UA (HX + UA)
  or vehicle (HX) treatment (n = 4 per group). Red arrows indicate the membrane oligomeric
  pores. Scale bars: 2 μm. * p < 0.05 compared to the NOR group, ** p < 0.01 compared
  to the NOR group, *** p < 0.001 compared to the NOR group, # p < 0.05 compared to
  the HX group, ## p < 0.01 compared to the HX group'
