figure_title: Interactions of BRs with other hormonal pathways.
caption: 'Interactions of BRs with other hormonal pathways. ET: BRs promote the expression
  of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACO) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
  acid synthase (ACS) to synthesize ethylene. BRs control the transcriptional and
  post-transcriptional regulation of ethylene production by lengthening the half-life
  of the ACS protein. Ethylene biosynthesis is either negatively or positively controlled
  by BR, depending on the dose. BR accelerates the expression of genes associated
  with ethylene production, including ACS. Moreover, BR stabilizes ACS proteins by
  breaking down 26S proteasomes and promotes the post-transcriptional production of
  ACS. ABA: By encouraging the phosphorylation and activation of SnRKs, ABA is recognized
  by PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors and releases SnRKs from PP2C-mediated repression. Subsequently,
  SnRKs phosphorylate downstream transcription factors, like ABI1/2, which control
  the transcription of several genes that respond to stress. In addition to directly
  phosphorylating and activating SnRKs and ABI1/2, BIN2, a negative regulator of BR
  signalling, can also be inactivated by PP2C BZR1 and also directly targets ABI,
  suppressing its transcription to adversely affect the expression of stress-responsive
  genes. H2O2: BR-encouraged H2O2 levels were initiated by an NADPH-dependent pathway.
  When BR binds to receptor kinase BRI1, it not only raises the cellular level of
  H2O2, which oxidizes BZR1 at a conserved cysteine residue, but also suppresses the
  kinase activity of BIN2 to induce dephosphorylation of BZR1. The transcriptional
  activity of BZR1 is enhanced by this oxidation. ET= ethylene; ABA= abscisic acid;
  H2O2 = hydrogen peroxide, PP2C = protein phosphatase 2C; ABI = abscisic acid-insensitive;
  SNRK = SNF1-regulated protein kinase; ABRE = abscisic acid responsive element. This
