figure_title: PPARγ agonist pioglitazone prevents hypoxia-induced cardiac dysfunction
  through modulation of the HIF-1α pathway.
caption: 'PPARγ agonist pioglitazone prevents hypoxia-induced cardiac dysfunction
  through modulation of the HIF-1α pathway. (A) Experimental design: 8-week-old C57BL/6J
  male mice were randomly divided into pio, pio combined with GW9662, and pio combined
  with KC7F2 groups under hypoxic conditions (n = 6). (B) Western blotting analysis
  in control and pio groups under hypoxia (n = 3). *P < 0.05 in control group vs.
  pio group under hypoxia. (C) Quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
  analysis of HIF-1α mRNA expression in cardiac tissues (n = 6). *P < 0.05 in control
  vs. pio group under hypoxia. (D-E) IMP amplitude and IMP beat rate in cardiomyocytes
  treated with pio, pio combined with GW9662, or pio combined with KC7F2 under 1%
  O2 for a duration of 7 hours. Data were from three independent experiments. *P <
  0.05, **P < 0.01 in pio vs. pio combined with KC7F2 groups under hypoxic. #P < 0.05,
  ##P < 0.01 in pio vs. pio combined with GW9662 groups under hypoxic. (F) Representative
  echocardiographic images and data analyses of LVEF and LVFS in pio, pio combined
  with GW9662, and pio combined with KC7F2 groups under hypoxic conditions (n = 6).
  Scale bars, vertical 2mm and horizontal 50ms. (G) Representative echocardiographic
  images and data analyses of TAPSE and RVWT in pio, pio combined with GW9662, and
  pio combined with KC7F2 groups under hypoxic conditions (n = 6). Scale bars, vertical
  2 mm and horizontal 50 ms. (H) Quantification of RV hypertrophy as assessed by RV/LV+Septum
  ratio (n = 6). (I) Western blotting and quantitative analyses of key enzymes involved
  in glycolysis and glucose oxidation in cardiac tissues of mice under hypoxia (n
  = 3). (F-I; δδP < 0.01 in pio group vs. pio combined with GW9662 group under hypoxia,
  ζP < 0.05, ζζP < 0.01 in pio group vs. pio combined with KC7F2 group under hypoxia)'
