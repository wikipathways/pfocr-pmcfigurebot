caption: 'Functions of cell surface ATP synthase (ecto-F1-ATPase). The ecto-F1-ATPase
  is present on the plasma membrane of different cell types, possibly through a trafficking
  secretory pathway after the assembly in the mitochondria. Similarly, IF1 might be
  possibly released into the extracellular environment. Under physiological conditions,
  ecto-F1-ATPase only has a hydrolytic function, converting ATP in ADP. IF1 inhibits
  this action, whereas apoA-I stimulates it. The generated ADP can activate the P2Y1
  receptor present on the plasma membrane of endothelial cells and it promotes cell
  survival and NO production. The extracellular ADP can also activate the P2Y13 receptor
  present on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes and promote HDL endocytosis; the cholesterol
  from HDL will eventually be removed via biliary lipid secretion. Certain studies
  have attributed a role in tumorigenesis to the ecto-F1-ATPase based on the possible
  (?) production of extracellular ATP achieved with a local inverse H+ gradient generated
  by the activity of an ectopic respiratory chain. The ecto-F1-ATPase has been associated
  with tumor angiogenesis due to its presence on endothelial cells and its inhibition
  by angiostatin, a protein with anti-angiogenic properties. By inhibiting the ectopic
  enzyme, angiostatin can reduce the amount of ATP, lower the intracellular pH, and
  reduce cell survival and proliferation. In tumor cells, Vγ9/Vδ2 T lymphocytes recognize
  ecto-F1-ATPase on the surface through their TCR, and apoA-I enhances the cellular
  response. The ecto-F1-ATPase interacts with MHC Class I molecules on the surface
  of nontumor cells via NKR and protects them from Vγ9/Vδ2 T lymphocyte recognition.
  Upper left inset: Apolipoprotein apoA-I could contribute to ecto-IF1 release in
  extracellular medium of hepatocytes. HepG2 cells (3 × 106 per condition) were stabilized
  1 h in serum-free medium and then incubated 20 min at 4°C with or without A-I (0,
  10, and 50 μg/mL). The presence of IF1 was then analyzed in extracellular medium
  (eIF1) by immunoprecipitation with anti-IF1 antibody and Western blot (). apoA-I,
  apolipoprotein A-I; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; NKR, natural killer receptors;
  TCR, T cell receptors. Color images are available online.'
