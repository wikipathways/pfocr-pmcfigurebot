  and glucose transport in skeletal muscle.
caption: Potential effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on the insulin-signaling pathway and
  glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Insulin-induced insulin receptor (IR) activation
  stimulates the phosphorylation of AKT and its substrate AS160. Activated AS160 elevates
  the GTP-bound forms of Rabs, which increases GLUT4 translocation, resulting in increased
  glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. However, BPA decreases glucose uptake by inhibiting
  the AKT/AS160/GLUT4 axis. Black arrows and red bars indicate activation and inhibition
  cascades, respectively. AS160; Akt substrate of 160 kDa (also known as TBC1D4);
  GLUT4, glucose transporter type 4; IR, insulin receptor; IRS-1, insulin receptor
  substrate-1; PI3K; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
