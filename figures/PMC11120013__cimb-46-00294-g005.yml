caption: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway stimulation by CP leads to multifactorial stimulation of cell survival and
  proliferation by indirectly stimulating the β-catenin pathway (indicated by dashed
  green arrow), activating nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) via ERK1/2 and inhibiting
