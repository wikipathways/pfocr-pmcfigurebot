caption: Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis
  of chemokines and chemokine receptors. (A) The yellow module was found to be closely
  associated with the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients
  and is identified as the key module. (B) GO enrichment analysis showed 20 hub genes
  in the yellow module were significantly enriched in pathways including cell chemotaxis,
  chemokine-mediated signaling, myeloid leukocyte migration, leukocyte chemotaxis,
  and response to chemokines. (C) KEGG enrichment analysis identified 20 hubs in the
  yellow module that were significantly enriched in viral protein interaction with
  cytokine and cytokine receptor, chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor
  interaction, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-17 pathways. NOD,
  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain; NF, nuclear factor
