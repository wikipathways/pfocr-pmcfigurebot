caption: Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes across cell passages.
  (A) Gene clustering based on expression levels across passages. The x-axis represents
  the samples, while the y-axis represents centralized and normalized expression values.
  The mean expression trends of the genes within each cluster are depicted by the
  purple lines. (B,C) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the genes in cluster
  2 (B) and cluster 4 (C). (D) Fold-change values for each gene in F7 compared to
  F3 cells. Gray points were not statistically significantly different between samples;
  red and blue points were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively,
  in F7 compared to F3 cells. Differences were considered statistically significant
  at |log2(fold change) â‰¥ 1| and false discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05. (E,F) Functional
  enrichment analyses of upregulated DEGs in F7 vs. F3 group with (E) Gene Ontology
  (GO) annotations and (F) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biochemical
  pathway annotations. (G) Functional enrichment analyses of downregulated DEGs in
  F3 vs. F7 group with GO annotations and KEGG biochemical pathway annotations. (H)
  Functional enrichment analyses of downregulated DEGs in F5 vs. F3 group with GO
  annotations and KEGG biochemical pathway annotations
