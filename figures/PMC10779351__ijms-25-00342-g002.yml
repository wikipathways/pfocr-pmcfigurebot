caption: Overview of NADPH Production Pathways in Cells. This figure illustrates the
  various biochemical pathways involved in the synthesis of NADPH, a crucial coenzyme
  in cellular metabolism. Key pathways include the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  the citric acid cycle, and fatty acid metabolism. The PPP, branching from glycolysis,
  is a major source of cytosolic NADPH, primarily through the action of enzymes like
  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD).
  NADPH is also generated in the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, involving
  enzymes like methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenases (MTHFD1, MTHFD2) and 10-formyl-THF
  dehydrogenases. Malic enzymes (MEs) and isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) further
  contribute to NADPH production, linking glycolysis with the Krebs cycle. Additionally,
  glutamine metabolism and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) in mitochondrial
  membranes play pivotal roles in maintaining NADPH levels. This figure encapsulates
  the dynamic equilibrium between NADPH synthesis and consumption, essential for cellular
  redox balance and biosynthesis. Cartoon in Figure 2 was created with BioRender.com
