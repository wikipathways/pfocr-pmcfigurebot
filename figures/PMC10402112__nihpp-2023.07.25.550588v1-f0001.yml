figure_title: The enterobactin biosynthetic pathway is a prominent contributor to
  the iron-responsive uropathogenic E. coli UTI89 exometabolome
caption: |-
  (A) Score plot from sparse PCA (sPCA) analysis of media conditioned by UTI89 grown in low and high iron media (wild type and wild type+Fe, respectively) and the enterobactin-null mutant UTI89∆entB in low and high iron media (entB and entB +Fe, respectively). High iron medium is achieved by addition of 100 µM FeCl3
  (B) LC-MS/MS chromatograms corresponding to the precursor-product ions from enterobactin for each experimental group. Chromatograms are displayed in identical ion current unit scales. (C) PC1-loadings plot demonstrates that multiple ions contribute to PC1. The top 13 metabolites with greater abundance in wild type UTI89 (lower PC1 value) are identified as red data points
