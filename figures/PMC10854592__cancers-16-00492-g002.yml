caption: 'STAT3 signaling pathway: STAT3 activation is initiated by upstream activity
  including ligand binding by (a) cytokines (IL-6 and non-IL-6 family members), (b)
  growth factors (EGF, FGF, etc.) to respective receptor-linked kinases, and (c) non-receptor-linked
  kinases (Scr, ABL). This triggers JAK activation through phosphorylation (p), with
  subsequent receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705.
  Activated STAT3 forms homodimers which translocate to the nucleus, bind consensus
  DNA, and regulate the transcription of target genes. Three main endogenous proteins
  negatively regulate the physiologic activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway; SOCS
  (suppressor of cytokine signaling), PTPs (protein tyrosine phosphatase), and PIAS
  (protein inhibitor of activated STAT). SOCS and PTPs interact directly with respective
  tyrosine kinase receptors and JAK. SOCS block recruitment of STAT3 and inhibit JAK
  kinase activity while PTPs dephosphorylate related JAK and can directly dephosphorylate
  STAT3 dimers. PIAS prevents STAT3 dimers from binding DNA. Created with BioRender.com'
