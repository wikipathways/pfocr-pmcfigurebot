figure_title: ACE2(high) airway-derived cell lines that are resistant to SARS-CoV-2
  replication express high baseline levels of type I IFN pathway genes
caption: (A) Hierarchical clustering of IFN response pathway RNA expression levels
  downloaded from CCLE. The heatmap displays z-scored log2(TPM) values. (B-E) RT-qPCR
  analysis of representative ISGs including Ifit1, Mx1, Irf9 and Stat1 in uninfected
  cells. Expression levels are normalized relative to Calu-3 cells (set to 1). N=2â€“4
  independent biological replicates, error bars denote SEM. (F) Immunoblot showing
  pSTAT1 (Y701 and S727), STAT1, IRF7, IRF9, MX1, IFIT1 and Vinculin levels across
  airway-derived cell lines (not infected). Blots are representative of two independent
  experiments. (G, H) The indicated airway-derived cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV-2
  infected cells at an MOI of 2 i.u./cell and expression of ISGs including Ifit1 and
  Ifit2 in was analyzed by RT-qPCR at 4 and 72 hpi. Y-axes indicate ISG fold induction
  at 72 hpi relative to 4hpi. Data show the mean from n=3 independent replicates,
  errors bars show the SEM
