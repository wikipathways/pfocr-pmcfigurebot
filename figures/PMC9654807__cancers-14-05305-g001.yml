caption: 'Summary of the six main mechanisms responsible for the DDR. (A) Mismatch
  repair: At the beginning of the process of the mismatch repair, mispaired bases
  are recognized by the sliding clamp MutSα homolog (MSH2:MSH6). Subsequently, the
  MLH1:PMS2complex is recruited for the incision, followed by the excision of the
  damage by exonuclease-1, resulting in a gap, which is then filled by Polδ and DNA
  ligase I. (B) BER: This pathway is responsible for the removal of small covalent
  modifications. These lesions are recognized by one of the specific DNA glycosylases
  and then hydrolyzed by AP-endonuclease (APE). PARP1 is recruited by nicked DNA due
  to APE1 and aid in DNA repair. If a single nucleotide is damaged, then the shortpatch
  BER pathway repairs it. The long-patch BER pathway is responsible for the repair
  of a lesion of at least two nucleotides. (C) Homologous recombination: This pathway
  is involved in the repair of the double-strand breaks and is carried out in late
  S and G2 phases when the homologous sister chromatid can be used as a template.
  In this process, ATM facilitates the activity of MRN complex at the site of DNA
  damage. The MRN complex then resects DNA from the dsDNA break site and the DNA strand
  is digested. As a result, single-stranded DNA is produced and RPA binds to it. BRCA1
  and BRCA2 proteins (linked by PALB2 protein) control Rad51 that facilitates the
  search for a homologous DNA sequence and the formation of a D-loop. DNA polymerase
  eta finishes this process. (D) NHEJ: This pathway is involved in DSB repair but
  does not require a homologous template. Two free DNA ends are bound by Ku70/Ku80
  heterodimer, DNA-PK is then utilized, and an active catalytic complex is formed.
  Subsequently, artemis endonuclease is also recruited for the endonucleolytic cleavage,
  then the Ligase IV/XRCC4 complex ligates DNA ends. A sub-pathway of NHEJ, which
  is an alternative end-joining, utilizes the Pol θ, PARP1 and MRN complex for DNA
  repair. (E) NER: This pathway is divided into two sub-pathways based on the DNA
  damage recognition step. Global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) detects
  and eliminates bulky DNA excisions throughout the genome, including non-transcribed
  regions and silent chromatin. In this pathway, XPC-RAD23B complex recognizes DNA
  lesions and recruits downstream factors. Transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) operates
  when a transcribed DNA strand is damaged, limiting transcription activity. TC-NER
  is triggered by RNAPIIo-bound Cockayne Syndrome Group B (CSB) protein, which recruits
  CSA via the CSA-interaction motif (CIM). Once recruited, CSA facilitates UVSSA’s
  association with stalled RNA Pol II (RNA P IIo). UVSSA is the key factor that recruits
  the TFIIH complex in response to CSB and CSA. TC-NER and GG-NER use the same mechanism
  after detecting damage. The TFIIH complex unwinds the DNA helix to obtain access
  to the pre-incision complex (XP family), allowing for RPA to be recruited. The damaged
  DNA is then excised, aided by XPG and the endonucleases excision repair cross-complementing
  enzyme group 1 (CPF-ERCC1). Then, the DNA gap is refilled by PCNA and RPC, followed
  by backbone repair via DNA ligase I. (F) Direct repair: The presence of the alkyl
  group at the O6 position of guanine causes G:C to A:T transitions. The direct repair
  functions through the removal of the alkyl group at the site of lesion by the enzyme
  O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), thus restoring the proper nucleotide.'
