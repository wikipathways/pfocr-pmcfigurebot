  in HCC cells.
caption: SPRED2 regulates autophagy through the ERK-mTORC1 signaling pathway in HCC
  cells. (A) Cell extracts were prepared from control [C], SPRED2-OE [OE], and SPRED2-KO
  [KO] HepG2 cells, and the presence of each protein was evaluated by Western blotting.
  Band densities were digitized and semi-quantitated. Data are presented as the mean
  ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. n = 3. (B) Control [C] and SPRED2-KO [KO] HepG2
  cells were treated with 20 μm rapamycin or vehicle (DMSO) for 6 h, after which cell
  lysates were prepared, and the presence of each protein was assessed by Western
  blotting. Band densities were digitized and semi-quantitated. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. n = 3. (C) Control [C]
  and SPRED2-KO [KO] HepG2 cells were treated with 20 μm PD98059 or vehicle (DMSO)
  for 1 h, after which cell lysates were prepared, and the presence of each protein
  was assessed by Western blotting. Band densities were digitized and semi-quantitated.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ****
  p < 0.0001. n = 3
