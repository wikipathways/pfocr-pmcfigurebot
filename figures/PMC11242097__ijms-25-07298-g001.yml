caption: 'Computational analysis pipeline. Transcriptional data obtained measuring
  RNA levels of tissue or blood samples of MCL patients and normal cases following
  a modular pipeline of network-based methods. Five microarray studies were revisited.
  Kimura et al. (GSE30189) isolated tissue samples of 17 CCND1-positive MCL patients
  at four stepwise distinct stages (in situ, classical, intermediate and aggressive)
  and four normal mantle zone B lymphocytes samples. Espinet et al. (GSE45717) collected
  PB B cells of five typical MCL patients and eight healthy individuals and obtained
  transcriptional data using Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays. Three Affymetrix
  Human U133 Plus 2 datasets were also analyzed. Leshchenko et al. (GSE19243) purified
  CD19+ fractions from peripheral blood of newly diagnosed MCL patients (five selected).
  Hartmann et al. extracted RNA from lymph node specimens (GSE21452) of 64 previously
  untreated MCL patients. Finally, Newman et al. (GSE65135) compared different human
  hematopoietic cell phenotypes, including B cells of five healthy tonsils. First,
  transcriptional data were preprocessed, then comparative analysis was performed
  between pairs of different sample groups. SVM models were also trained using the
  most variable genes of each sample group, and MCL and samples were recategorized
  accordingly. The Limma R package was employed and differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) were selected based on an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05. Next, DEGs
  were used as an input to four independent subsequent analysis: pathway enrichment
  (performed by two bioinformatic tools pathfindR [18] and PaintOmics [19]), drug
  repurposing, co-expression network spectral clustering, and compound drug combination
  prediction analyses'
