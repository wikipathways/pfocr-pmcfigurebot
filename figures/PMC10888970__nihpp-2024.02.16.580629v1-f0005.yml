figure_title: RNA-seq analysis of Fgfr1FCPG and Fgfr1FCSPG E8.5 tailbud tissue reveals
  downregulation of genes involved in ECM interaction and PIP signaling pathways
caption: A) Schematic of signaling mutant alleles constructed in Fgfr1 gene. The most
  severe allele, Fgfr1FCSPGMyc, has an additional mutation at Y730, a potential binding
  site for SFKs and/or p85, in addition to the FCPG mutations that disrupt downstream
  canonical signaling. B) Both Fgfr1FCPG/FCPG and Fgfr1FCSPG/FCSPG embryos show severe
  defects at E10.5 Phenotypes are variable, but most Fgfr1FCPG/FCPG embryos fail between
  E9.5 and E10.5, while all Fgfr1FCSPG/FCSPG fail at or before E9.5. Phenotypes include
  axial truncations, neural tube closure defects, somitogenesis defects, and cardiac
  defects. Scale bar represents 1mm. C) Tailbud tissue was dissected from wild-type
  and homozygous Fgfr1FCPG and Fgfr1FCSPG embryos at E8.5 to examine the onset of
  the observed phenotypic changes. Allantois tissue was removed from the tailbud tissue
  (dashed lines). D) Venn diagram depicting significant differentially expressed genes
  in homozygous Fgfr1FCPG or Fgfr1FCSPG mutant tailbud tissue compared to wild-type
  tissue at E8.5. E) Volcano plots displaying differential gene expression between
  Fgfr1FCPG/FCPG mutants and wild type, Fgfr1FCSPG/FCSPG mutants and wild type, and
  Fgfr1FCSPG/FCSPG mutants and Fgfr1FCPG/FCPG mutants, respectively, at E8.5. Horizontal
  dashed line signifies significance cut-off of p=0.05. F) KEGG Pathway GSEA of genes
  downregulated in Fgfr1FCSPG tissue compared to Fgfr1FCPG tissue. The most significantly
  downregulated BP terms revolve around tissue migration, indicating that S mutation
  may differentially affect Fgfr1’s role in cell migration. Additionally, KEGG Pathway
  GSEA identified ECM-receptor interaction, inositol signaling, and pathways related
  to calcium regulation. G) At E8.5, Fgfr1FCSPG/FCSPG embryos display a significant
  reduction in somitogenesis as seen by Meox1 and Hes7 expression. In contrast, Fgfr1FCPG/FCPG
  exhibits normal somitogenesis at this stage. Scale bar represents 200μm. H) At E9.5,
  both Fgfr1FCPG/FCPG and Fgfr1FCSPG/FCSPG exhibit defective patterning in intermediate
  mesoderm and somitic mesoderm, as marked by Pax2 and Uncx4.1, respectively. Scale
  bar represents 200μm.
