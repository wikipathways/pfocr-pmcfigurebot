caption: Visualization of interacting targets in the active components of red ginseng
  and POF. Venn diagram of the numbers of overlapping and specific targets in red
  ginseng pairs (blue circle) and POF (yellow circle) (a); complex target pathway
  network of red ginseng against POF. The pink V-shaped node is the active component
  in red ginseng and the blue node is the potential target (b). The selected core
  objectives (c); GO enrichment of red ginseng against POF and KEGG pathway analysis
  of POF targets (d,e)
