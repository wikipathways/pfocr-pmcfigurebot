figure_title: Regulation of autophagy by glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and glutamine
  in glioma.
caption: Regulation of autophagy by glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and glutamine in
  glioma. Autophagy could be regulated by Hexokinase2 (HK2), which directly binds
  and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) leading to autophagy.
  Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase3 (PFKFB3) induces autophagy by
  phosphorylating at 5′AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GA3PDH) inhibits mTOR by binding to Rheb. PGK1 activates Beclin1
  and induces autophagy; pyruvate kinase (PMK2) activates autophagy by inhibiting
  phosphorylation at AKT1 substrate 1 (AKT1S1) a mTORC1 inhibitor. Fatty acid synthase
  (FASN) inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1α) and transcription factor EB
  (TFEB), Ceramide (Ce) induces autophagy by activating at c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK)/c-Jun pathway. Omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3-PUFAS) activate at
  AMPK; Phosphoinositides (3,4,5)triphosphate (PtdIns (3,4,5) P3) activate at mTOR.
  Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) activates at AMPK. Abbreviations,
  leucine (leu)Glutamine synthetase, glutamine (Gln), glutamate (Glu), Glutaminase
  (GLS), Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), Glutamine transport via alanine/serine/cysteine
  transporter 2 (ASCT2), glutathione (GSH), Forkhead box O (FOXO). ↑ activation, ⊥
  inhibition. The figure was created with BioRender.com
