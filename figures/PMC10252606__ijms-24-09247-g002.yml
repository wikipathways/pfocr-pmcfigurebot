caption: 'Box plot of the two groups of infants in relation to the abundance of glycerophospholipid
  metabolism counts. The y-axis shows the relative frequencies of the metabolic pathway
  reads. p-value = 7.7 × 10−6. The means and standard deviations of the groups were:
  Allergic = 0.521 ± 0.052 and Non-Allergic = 0.439 ± 0.033'
