caption: Proposed model for cancer stem-like cell (CSC)/melanoma stem cell (MSC) generation
  from normal and cancer cells. (A) Generation of CSCs/MSCs results from the transformation
  of normal stem/progenitor cells into undifferentiated cancer cells via multiple
  genetic mutations and dedifferentiation-dependent mechanisms. (B) Generation of
  MSCs from cancer cells. This model describes the generation of MSCs from tumor cells
  through the activation of aberrant signaling pathways via driver mutations to tumor
  growth signaling pathways and activation of self-renewal genes. MSCs become educated
  to divide into tumor progenitor cells/MSCs. The produced MSCs possess genetic properties
  which allow for the division into one differentiated cell and one MSC. Once the
  dedifferentiation process of the differentiated cell is complete, the dedifferentiated
  cells can be transformed into MSCs. CSCs/MSCs undergo abnormal asymmetric cell division
  to produce two daughter cells, one CSC and one non-CSC
