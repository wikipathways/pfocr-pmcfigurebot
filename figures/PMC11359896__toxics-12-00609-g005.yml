caption: KEGG analysis of DEGs. (A) Bar chart of KEGG classification statistics. The
  horizontal coordinate indicates the names of the KEGG metabolic pathway; the vertical
  coordinate is the number of genes or transcripts annotated to the pathway. (B) Top
  20 enriched KEGG signaling pathways. The size of the dots indicates the number of
  genes in this KEGG term, and the color of the dots corresponds to different Padjust
  ranges
