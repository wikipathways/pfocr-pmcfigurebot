figure_title: The metabolic hallmarks between AD and non-AD samples were detected
  by comparative transcriptomic analysis.
caption: The metabolic hallmarks between AD and non-AD samples were detected by comparative
  transcriptomic analysis. (a) The volcano plot of DEGs between AD and non-AD groups.
  (b) The core metabolic network of significantly differential MPP signatures unveils
  important metabolic pathways. We selected the top 10 metabolic pathways ranked by
  the MCC algorithm and their neighbors for visualization. Hub nodes are also labeled
  by color, and the nodes with a deeper color have a higher rank. Green nodes are
  the neighbor nodes of hub nodes. (c) The functional annotation analysis of DEGs
  by the KEGG database. Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) has been used to calculate
  the enrichment level of KEGG from DEGs. (d) The functional annotation analysis of
  DEGs by the GO database. ORA has been used to calculate the enrichment level of
  GO from DEGs. (e) The boxplot of metabolic pathways between AD and non-AD samples
  reveals significantly differential metabolic pathways. (f) The functional annotation
  analysis of DEGs by hallmark pathways. ORA has been used to calculate the enrichment
  level of HALLMARKS from DEGs. (g) The heatmap of DEGs between AD and non-AD groups.
  We selected significant DEGs from all the available ones for visualization. (h)
  The heatmap of differential MPP signatures. We selected significantly differential
  MPP signatures from all available ones for visualization. hsa01040, Biosynthesis
  of unsaturated fatty acids; hsa00052, Galactose metabolism; hsa00780, Biotin metabolism;
