figure_title: House dust mite impaired interferon responses in rhinovirus-infected
  bronchial epithelium of patients with asthma
caption: a mRNA expression of IFNB (IFN-β) (upper panel) in in vitro-cultured HBECs
  from controls (n = 9, vehicle, RV-A16; n = 8, HDM; n = 7, HDM + RV-A16) and asthma
  (n = 7, vehicle; n = 9, HDM, RV-A16; n = 12, HDM + RV-A16), and DDX58 (RIG-I) (lower
  panel) in in vitro-cultured HBECs from controls (n = 10) and asthma (n = 8, vehicle;
  n = 9, HDM, RV-A16; n = 11, HDM + RV-A16) assessed using RT-PCR and presented as
  relative quantification (RQ = 2-ΔΔCt) as compared to the vehicle condition. b Visualization
  of interaction network of significant proteins secreted to the apical compartment
  in in vitro-cultured HBECs from control individuals (n = 5, left panel) and patients
  with asthma (n = 8, right panel) after in vitro treatment with HDM + RV-A16, when
  compared to RV-A16 infection alone assessed with PEA targeted proteomics. Network
  nodes represent log2FC of significantly upregulated (red), and downregulated (blue)
  proteins; proteins not interacting with each other are not shown. Edges represent
  protein-protein interactions. Proteins enriched in viral infection or cytokine-mediated
  signaling pathway are marked with blue and red eclipses, respectively. c Expression
  of CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL3, and CCL4 in the apical compartment of in vitro-cultured
  HBECs from patients with asthma pre-treated with HDM or vehicle, followed by the
  in vitro infection with RV-A16 in the presence of BX795 or vehicle and assessed
  with PEA proteomics (n = 5). Data presented as the percentage of the response to
  the RV-A16 condition. HBECs from patients with asthma are presented in red, HBECs
  from control individuals are presented in blue. (n) indicates the number of biologically
  independent samples examined over at least three independent experiments. Bar graph
  data present mean ± SEM analyzed with one-way ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis test), RM one-way
  ANOVA (Friedman test) or mixed-effects model with post-hoc analysis, as appropriate,
  depending on the data relation and distribution. PEA data were analyzed by Bioconductor
  limma package, raw p-value presented. Source data are provided as Source Data files.
  BX795, TBK1/IKKε inhibitor; HBECs differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells,
  HDM house dust mite, RV-A16 rhinovirus A16.
