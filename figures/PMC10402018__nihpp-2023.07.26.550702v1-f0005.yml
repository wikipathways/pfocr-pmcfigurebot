caption: Inhibition of the Raf1 pathway negatively impacts viral DNA and protein accumulation.
  (A-C) MRC5 fibroblasts were treated with 2.17 uM of Regorafenib or Sorafenib, or
  DMSO control at the time of infection with AD169, at an MOI of 3.0 for indicated
  amount of time. (A) Viral DNA was quantified by qPCR of the viral gene, IE1 (avg±SD,
  n=12). (B) Samples in (A) were compared by area under the curve (AUC) to show the
  significance between treatments over the course of infection (avg±SD, n=12). (C)
  Viral protein expression levels at 24-, 72-, and 96 hours post-infection (hpi) were
  assessed by western blot. GAPDH was used as a loading control
