caption: LPS (TLR4)-mediated inflammation and its interplay with RhoA activation and
  the downstream ROCK signaling pathways. LPS triggers the liberation of NF-κB from
  IκB, allowing for the NF-κB nuclear translocation and initiation of pro-inflammatory
  gene transcription. LPS also triggers the dephosphorylation of cofilin, which is
  the terminus of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. Some of the effects of RhoA/ROCK
  signaling on inflammation remain elusive
