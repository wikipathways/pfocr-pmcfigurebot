caption: Systemic inhibition of TGF-β signaling in the fibrotic lung by pirfenidone
  and localized inhibition of TGF-β signaling in the fibrotic niche by bexotegrast
  (A,B). Both pirfenidone and bexotegrast affect the synthesis of CTHRC1 and other
  profibrotic genes, such as COL1A1, COL3A1, and TIMP1. This reduces collagen deposition,
  tissue stiffness, and the invasive properties of collagen- and CTHRC1-positive profibrotic
  fibroblasts. Bexotegrast acts as a dual integrin αVβ6 and αVβ1 inhibitor that attenuates
  pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the integrin-dependent activation of latent TGF-β.
  Pirfenidone globally blocks the synthesis and activation of TGF-β. Only the canonical
  TGF-β signaling pathway is depicted. The proposed negative feedback effect of CTHRC1
  on TGF-β signaling, which involves the degradation of phospho-SMAD2/3 by the proteasome
  (indicated by broken arrows), is highlighted. This feedback mechanism may terminate
  the normal wound-healing response. The pathological effects of elevated CTHRC1 on
  fibrosis, induced by repetitive injury, may involve a different mechanism of action.
