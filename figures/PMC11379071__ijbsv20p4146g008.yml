caption: A diagram illustrating the underlying molecular mechanism identified in the
  present study. Mechanistically, increased m6A modification of the LATS2 mRNA, which
  is recognized by YTHDF2, facilitates its degradation through the CCR4-NOT complex.
  Reduced LATS2 expression activates YAP1, promoting GSH synthesis via the ATF4/PSAT1
  pathway, ultimately enhancing ferroptosis resistance

  by inhibiting ferroptosis through the YAP1/ATF4/PSAT1 axis
