  in DSS-induced colitis rats.
caption: The possible underlying pathways of MLB cell migration to the colon in DSS-induced
  colitis rats. (A) Heatmap displaying differentially expressed genes between NC MLB
  and DSS MLB. (B) Volcano plot analysis illustrates the differentially expressed
  genes between DSS MLB and NC MLB. (C) KEGG analysis demonstrates the enrichment
  pathways of differentially expressed genes between DSS MLB and NC MLB. (D) Enrichment
  plot and key upregulated genes in B cell-related chemokine signaling pathway between
  DSS MLB and NC MLB. (E) Comparison of Cxcl13 mRNA expression in colonic tissues
  and Cxcr5 mRNA expression in MLB cells between NC and DSS rats using real-time PCR
  (Cxcl13, p = 0.0386; Cxcr5, p = 0.04). (F) Enrichment plot and key upregulated genes
  in B cell differentiation, B cell-mediated immunity, and B cell receptor signaling
  pathway between DSS MLB and NC MLB. (G) Comparison of Il6 (B cell differentiation)
  expression and Cd40 (B cell-mediated immunity) expression between NC MLB and DSS
  MLB using real-time PCR. NC MLB, mesenteric lymphatic B cells derived from normal
  control rat; DSS MLB, mesenteric lymphatic B cells derived from DSS-induced colitis
  rat; NC, normal control; DSS, DSS-induced colitis; n = 3–4; Mann–Whitney test; *
  p < 0.05 with NC MLB
