caption: (A) Heatmap of mRNA expression related to the focal adhesion signaling pathway
  in gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells. Gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells were treated
  with piceamycin (PCM) (1.25 μM) versus control (PBS with DMSO-treated) for 48 h.
  The color represents mRNA level using z-score (yellow; positive score; upregulation,
  blue; negative score; downregulation) and displayed on the column (according to
  z-score; –2≤z≤2, AVE; average of z-score, STD; standard deviation of z-score, n=3).
  Normalized value (mRNA level) of Rac2, Rac3, and VAV3. (B) Modified KEGG pathway
  from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway of the genes related
  to focal adhesion signaling pathway from RNA-sequencing data. Gemcitabine-resistant
  AsPC-1 cells were treated with piceamycin (1.25 μM) for 48 h compared with control
  (PBS with DMSO-treated). The box colors of the Modified KEGG pathway indicate fold
  change of mRNA expression. (C) The protein expressions of focal adhesion-related
  biomarkers (FAK and Rac) were analyzed by western blotting in gemcitabine-resistant
  AsPC-1 cells. Piceamycin (PCM) was treated in the gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells
  with indicated concentrations. α-Tubulin was used as an internal control. (D) The
  protein expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related biomarkers
  (N-cadherin, Slug, and Snail) were analyzed by western blotting in gemcitabine-resistant
  AsPC-1 cells. Piceamycin was treated on the gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells with
  indicated concentrations. α-Tubulin was used as an internal control. (E) Effect
  of piceamycin on gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells migration. Monolayers of gemcitabine-resistant
  AsPC-1 cells were scratched mechanically and treated with piceamycin (indicated
  concentrations) for 48 h. Representative images of wound closure obtained under
  a light microscope. All data are presented as mean ± SD (n=3, *p<0.05, **p<0.01).
  (F) Effect of piceamycin on gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells invasion. The cells
  (treated with piceamycin) (at 0, 1, 2, and 5 μM concentration) that invaded to lower
  chambers were fixed, stained, imaged, and counted. All data are presented as mean
  ± SD (n=3, *p<0.05) (Scale bars, 50 μm)
