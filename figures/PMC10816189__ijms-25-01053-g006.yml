caption: Plant hormone signal transduction pathway, with Zhuansihao serving as the
  control and 071113 as the experimental group. In this figure, up-regulated genes
  are depicted in red, while down-regulated genes are shown in green. Both up-regulated
  and down-regulated genes are shown in blue. These genes were identified through
  RNA-Seq sequencing in the 071113 experimental group
