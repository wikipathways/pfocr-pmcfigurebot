caption: The enhanced proliferation of VSMCs isolated from T2D mice is caused by Ca2+-dependent
  Erk1/2 proliferation. (A) Representative immunoblots for phosphorylated (active)
  Erk1/2 and total Erk1/2 protein, and their quantification for cultured VSMCs isolated
  from NG and T2D WT and mtCaMKIIN mice (n = 8). (B) Representative immunoblots for
  signaling pathway components upstream of Erk1/2 activation in cultured VSMCs from
  T2D mice of the WT and mtCaMKIIN genetic backgrounds. (C,D) Fold changes in cell
  number in (C) WT NG (n = 9), (D) WT T2D (n = 10←) VSMCs 72 h after addition of PDGF
  and the Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126. (E) Representative immunoblot assessing phosphorylated
  (active) Erk-1/2 and (total) Erk1/2 protein levels and their quantification in cultured
  cells isolated from T2D mice of the WT genotype 15 min after addition of PDGF and
  preincubation with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (10 µM for 1 h), (n = 6). Analyses by
  Kruskal–Wallis test (A,C–E)
