figure_title: Intra-articular bleeding induces cartilage degradation through down-reulation
  of cartilage Akt pathway.
caption: Intra-articular bleeding induces cartilage degradation through down-reulation
  of cartilage Akt pathway. During this process, the soluble COL II released from
  the damaged cartilage can activate peripheral CD4+ T cells, differention into Th17
  cells and secretion of IL-17, which consequently induces liver impairment. Intra-articular
  application of sc79 (inhibitor of Akt pathway) can prevent the cartilage damage
  as well as its peripheral influences
