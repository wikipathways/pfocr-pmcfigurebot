caption: 'Schematic representation of the PHENSIM Drug repurposing Strategy. Outline
  for our approach to acquire a cell-specific viral signature in silico and formulate
  repurposing hypotheses: (a) first, logFold Changes (logFCs) of Differentially Expressed
  Genes (DEGs) arising from transcriptomic genome wide expression analysis of infected
  vs. baseline uninfected cells are used to represent a virus in the meta-pathway;
  (b) then, we run the PHENSIM simulation by upregulating the viral node; (c) therefore,
  we collect all perturbation values computed by PHENSIM for pathway endpoints to
  define a cell-specific pathogen signature. (d) The same process is applied to expression
  data arising from whole transcriptome-wide expression analysis of treated vs. mock-treated
  cell lines, (e) to perform a PHENSIM simulation of the drug activity, (f) yielding
  a cell-specific drug signature. (g) Thus, this process is iterated for each drug
  we wish to test and collected in a database of drug signatures. (h) Finally, a Pearson
  correlation analysis between the pathogen and each drug signature is used to score
  repurposing candidates, yielding hypothesis for further laboratory tests. In panels
  (a) and (d), we report upregulated DEGs in red and downregulated ones in blue. In
  panels (c), (f), and (g), we report positively perturbated endpoints in green and
  negatively perturbated endpoints in blue. Finally, in panel (h), negative correlation
  (reported in green) predicts promising drug candidates that inhibit the pathogen
  signature and positive correlation (reported in red) suggests exacerbation of the
  viral signature when introducing the drug.'
