  pathway.
caption: 'PN reduces IL−1β-induced HC-a inflammation through the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A) Whole cell lysate protein expression and (B–E) quantitative analyses of total
  and phosphorylated forms of p65 and IκBα protein expression levels. Effect of PN
  on the expression of pp65 protein in HC-a cells stimulated by IL−1β in the presence
  of the 5HPP-33 NF-κB signaling inhibitor, as evaluated through (F) protein expression
  levels, (G) quantitative analysis, and (H) immunofluorescence (bars = 100 μm; original
  magnification × 20). (I) Protein expression of pathway mediators (MMP3, MMP13, iNOS,
  and COX2) and (J–M) quantitative analysis of pathway mediators to determine the
  downstream effects of NF-κB inhibition with the 5HPP-33 NF-κB signaling inhibitor.
  The results of three independent experiments are presented as the mean ± standard
  deviation (SD). #### p < 0.0001 compared to the control group; ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001 compared to the IL−1β-treated group; and @ p < 0.05,
  @@@ p < 0.001, and @@@@ p < 0.0001 compared to the PN treated group'
