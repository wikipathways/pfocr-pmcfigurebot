caption: (A)-(C) Expression map of ANXA11 in human brain cells. (A) Single nuclei
  sequencing data from control brains demonstrating the two cell types that highly
  express ANXA11, microglia and neurons. Unsupervised clustering of 34 cell types
  in the human brain. UMAP projections illustrating different cell types identified
  is shown on the left (A) and ANXA11 expression levels shown on the right (B). Scale
  represents log2 normalized average gene expression levels. Dot plot illustrating
  the mean normalized expression of ANXA11 by cell type (C). Scale represents percentage
  of total cell population expressing ANXA11, with color representing mean normalized
  expression per cell type. (D) and (E) Differential gene expression between wildtype
  and mutant ANXA11. (D) and (E) Bland-Altman mean difference plots where each dot
  indicates a gene for which there are counted reads from scRNAseq in iPSC-derived
  neurons (D) and iPSC-derived microglia (E). The x-axis is average normalized counts
  and the y-axis is log2 fold change. Neuronal differential expression yields few
  significant genes related to transcriptional regulation and endocytic vesicles (D)
  while many more differentially expressed in microglia related to transcriptional
  regulation and endocytic vesicles (E). (F) and (G) Differential microglial gene
  expression interferon signaling pathway. (F) STRING diagram of differentially expressed
  microglial genes in the interferon signaling pathway and innate immune response.
  Colors indicate padj. (G) Gene ontology terms for biological processes of microglial
  gene expression hits indicating interferon response and innate immunity. Dot size
  indicates number of genes in each GO grouping and color indicates âˆ’log10(FDR).
