figure_title: Orthogonal test for key findings
caption: We visualize the correlation between PRS and (A) divalent inorganic cation
  homeostasis activity, and (C) calcium signaling pathway activity, (E) amyloid beta
  clearance activity, and (G) muscle tissue development activity, respectively. In
  (B), (D), (F), and (H), we plot the GSVA score distribution difference within group
  1 versus group 2 comparisons among strata comparison, accordingly
