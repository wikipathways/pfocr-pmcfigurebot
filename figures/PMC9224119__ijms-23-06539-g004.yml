caption: Interaction between tumor-derived WNT and immune cells. Increased production
  of WNT by tumor cells (right part of the figure) stimulates an autocrine pathway
  that promotes the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and chemokines (MCP-1).
  Both cytokines and WNT are maintained at a high level of expression by a self-feeding
  loop. Chemokines are critical for populating the tumor microenvironment (TME) with
  immune cells. The different cytokines induced by WNT, together with the WNT ligand
  itself, would stimulate other cells in the TME, such as tumor-associated fibroblasts
  or endothelial cells that further amplify the effects of WNT. At a later stage,
  once immune cells are recruited to the TME, WNT begins to play a different role
  (left part of the figure). In this new scenario, WNT activates a TLR/MyD88/p50 pathway,
  promoting the synthesis of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. As a result, WNT
  induces immunosuppression and the formation of tolerogenic mononuclear phagocytes.
