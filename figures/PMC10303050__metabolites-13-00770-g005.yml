caption: Pearson correlation matrix among individual metabolites of the central carbon
  metabolic pathway in Scotia tomato seedlings treated with pyroligneous acid (PA)
  under aluminum (Al) stress. The red colour represents a strong negative association,
  and the green colour represents a strong positive association. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; FMN, flavin mononucleotides;
  FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate
