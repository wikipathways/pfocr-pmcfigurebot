figure_title: Schematic overview of cellular pathways modulated by ASFV.
caption: Schematic overview of cellular pathways modulated by ASFV. The pathways have
  been reproduced and simplified from KEGG pathway maps [160] for endocytosis (hsa04144),
  cytosolic DNA-sensing (cGAS-STING) pathway (hsa04623), JAK-STAT signaling pathway
  (hsa04630), and NF-ĸB (hsa04064) and NFAT (hsa04660) signaling pathways. Viral proteins
  are marked in red font, and host proteins are in blue boxes. The effects caused
  by the interactions between proteins are represented by the edges and explained
  in the legend. Created with BioRender.com. * CD163 and SIGLEC1 are considered to
  act together as potential receptors for ASFV entry
