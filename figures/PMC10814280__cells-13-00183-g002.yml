caption: ': promotion : inhabition. Mechanism of RABV-induced mitochondrial apoptosis.
  RABV is able to cause mitochondrial apoptosis in late replication and is regulated
  by the BCL-2 family of genes. The three proteins of RABV, M, G, and P are closely
  related to apoptosis. The M protein inhibits the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2, causing
  mitochondrial apoptosis and the release of cytochrome C and AIF factors. Caspase-dependent
  pathway (➀): released cytochrome C activates caspase-9, which further activates
  the downstream caspase-3, causing apoptosis. Non-caspase-dependent pathway (➁):
  released AIF can directly cause apoptosis'
