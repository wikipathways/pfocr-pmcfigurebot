caption: Effect of PFD, AGP, and PFD + AGP on the viability of Lx-2 cells. (a) Cell
  viability (%) of Lx-2 cells treated with PFD of various concentrations. (b) Cell
  viability (%) of Lx-2 cells treated with AGP of various concentrations. (c) Cell
  viability (%) of Lx-2 cells treated with PFD of various time gradients. (d) Cell
  viability (%) of Lx-2 cells treated with AGP of various time gradients. (e) Cell
  viability (%) of Lx-2 cells treated with PFD (0, 0.5, and 1 mM) and AGP of various
  concentrations. (f) LX-2 cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 24 hr, then
  were stimulated with AGP (10 μM) or/and PFD (1 mM) for 24 hr. Cell viability was
  measured by MTT assay.  ∗∗P < 0.01.
