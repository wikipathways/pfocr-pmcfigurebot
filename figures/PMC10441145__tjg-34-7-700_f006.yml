caption: The mRNAs contained in clusters 1 (A) and 2 (B) are significantly correlated
  with the gene ontology biological process and KEGG signaling pathway. The horizontal
  axis indicates the gene number, the vertical axis indicates the item name, the color
  of the column represents significance, and the closer the color is to orange, the
  higher the significance
