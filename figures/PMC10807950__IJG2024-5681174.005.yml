  It is an analysis of DEGs, comparing drought-treated and control samples. Boxes
  in a color frame indicate that the corresponding DEGs were down- or upregulated
  in the drought-treated samples, and the boxes with a white frame suggest that the
  expression levels of the related genes were not significantly changed in our RNA-Seq
