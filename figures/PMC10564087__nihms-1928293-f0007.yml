figure_title: Heparan sulfate (HS) or an IL-2 immunocytokine bias IL-2 signaling toward
  the non-canonical pathway
caption: (A) Binding of soluble MAdCAM-1 to YFP+ Tregs isolated from either TlnWT/fl;Foxp3Cre-YFP
  control mice or TlnL325 R/fl;Foxp3Cre-YFP mice treated with IL-2 (2.5 μg/mL) alone
  or in combination with HS (40 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of PTX (100 nM).
  Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 5). One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.(B) Binding
  of soluble MAdCAM-1 to GFP+ Tregs in the presence of either an F5111 immunocytokine
  (F5111 IC) or control anti-FITC IC (control IC) in the presence or absence of PTX
  or a function-blocking anti-IL-2 β receptor (anti-CD122). Data represent mean ±
  SEM (n = 6). Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.(C) F5111 IC induces association
  of human CD25 and CCR7.(D) Extracellular matrix or monoclonal antibodies (e.g.,
  PC61 or F5111) (depicted) can bias IL-2 signaling toward a chemokine receptor pathway.
