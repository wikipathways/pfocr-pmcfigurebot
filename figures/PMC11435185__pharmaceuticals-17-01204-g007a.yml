caption: 'IMD up-regulates CPT-1β via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (A) Western
  blot analysis of p-AMPK (Thr172), AMPK, p-Akt (Ser473), Akt, p-PKA (Thr197), and
  PKA protein levels in NRCMs. n = 3. (B) Western blot analysis of p-AMPK (Thr172)
  and AMPK protein levels in DCM rat hearts. n = 3. (C) Western blot analysis of p-Akt
  (Ser473) and Akt protein levels in DCM rat hearts. n = 3. (D) Western blot analysis
  of p-AMPK (Thr172) and AMPK protein levels in the hearts of diabetic WT, IMDtg,
  and IMD−/− mice. n = 3. (E) Western blot analysis of p-Akt (Ser473) and Akt protein
  levels in the hearts of diabetic WT, IMDtg, and IMD−/− mice. n = 3. (F) Enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay of NRCM supernatant CPT-1β activity. n = 5–6. (G,H) Western
  blot analysis of CPT-1β protein levels in NRCMs. n = 3. (I) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay of acetyl-CoA concentration in the supernatants of NRCMs. n = 4. (J) Representative
  images and quantification of surface (μm2) in NRCMs analyzed by ImageJ 1.53k. Scale
  bar: 100 μm, 50 μm. n = 3–4. (K) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of Nppa and
  Nppb mRNA expression in NRCMs. n = 4. (L) Representative images and quantification
  of immunofluorescence staining for αSMA (green), Col1a1 (red) and DAPI (blue) in
  primary cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts. Merged images are shown. Scale bar: 50
  μm. n = 3. +: added. −: not added. Data are mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
