caption: ROC curve-based Hippo signaling pathway dysregulation was assessed in the
  mRNA expression profiles GSE10971 and GSE14407. (A,B) ROC curve of Hippo gene set,
  YAP1, and MST1 genes can predict the serous subtype by greater specificity and sensitivity
  with significant areas under the curve and p values
