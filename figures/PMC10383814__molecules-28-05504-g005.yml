caption: |-
  ATL III alleviates liver fibrosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway. (A) Molecular docking of ATL III with the protein PI3K. (B) ATL III binding to the PI3K. (C) Molecular docking of ATL III with the protein AKT. (D) ATL III binding to the AKT. (E) Protein expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, and AKT in the liver. Protein expression statistics of (F) p-AKT/AKT and (G) p-PI3K/PI3K. Results are expressed as mean Â± SD, n = 3. ##
  p < 0.01 compared with the sham group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with the model group
