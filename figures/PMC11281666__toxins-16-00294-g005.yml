  in Human Normal Hepatocytes
caption: 'Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR validates the accuracy of sequencing
  results: (A) qRT-PCR results for EGR1 and ZNF890P in the DON, 3-ADON and 15-ADON
  groups were consistent with the sequencing results; (B) six identical genes in the
  common regulatory pathway were selected for qRT-PCR in the DON and 15-ADON groups
  and the results were consistent with the sequencing results; and (C) five genes
  in the nonalcoholic fatty liver pathway, a specific pathway regulated by the 15-ADON
  group, were selected for qRT-PCR and the results were consistent with the sequencing
  results'
