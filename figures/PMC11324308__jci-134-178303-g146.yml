figure_title: MSTN ablation in BAT shows signatures of mitochondrial dysfunction and
  inflammation
caption: '(A) PCA plot of the BAT samples from the BKO and Flox groups. (B) Heatmap
  plot comparing 414 upregulated genes and 202 downregulated genes between BKO and
  Flox groups. (C) Enriched KEGG pathways for downregulated genes. (D) Enriched KEGG
  pathways for upregulated genes. (E) Relative mRNA expression of inflammatory genes
  (n = 6). (F) F4/80 staining of BAT. Scale bars: 20 μm. (G) Relative mRNA expression
  of inflammatory genes in macrophages cocultured with BAT from BKO or Flox mice (n
  = 5). (H) Western blot analysis of KLF4 in BAT (n = 3). (I) Relative mRNA expression
  of Klf4 in BAT (n = 6). (J) Schematic model of the downstream pathway of MSTN. (K)
  Western blot analysis of SMAD2/3 and the non-SMAD pathway in BAT from BKO and Flox
  mice (n = 3). t, total. (L and M) Western blot analysis of KLF4 in primary brown
  adipocytes treated with PBS and a SMAD2/3 or p38 inhibitor (n = 3). (N) Western
  blot analysis of KLF4 in primary brown adipocytes from Flox and BKO mice. In the
  BKO plus p38 agonist group, primary brown adipocytes were treated with 1 μM dehydrocorydaline
  (n = 3). (O) Western blot analysis of KLF4 in primary brown adipocytes treated with
  PBS, rMSTN, or rMSTN plus inhibitors. In the rMSTN plus inhibitors group, primary
  brown adipocytes were treated with a SMAD2/3 and p38 inhibitor (n = 3). All results
  are shown as the mean ± SEM. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001, by 2-tailed Student t
