figure_title: Overall Distribution of signaling pathway across cell clusters in normal
  skin
caption: 'A) UMAP visualization identifies eight cell subpopulations from six donors.
  B) Circle plots show the number of interactions (left) and the weights of these
  interactions weights (right) in all cell clusters. C) Heatmap illustrates the relative
  contribution of each cell group to outgoing or incoming signals. P: Paracrine manner;
  A: Autocrine manner. Endo: Endothelial cell, Fib: Fibroblast, Lym: Lymphocyte, KC1:
  Keratinocyte 1, Smo: Smooth muscle cell, Mye: Myeloid cell, Mel: Melanocyte. D)
  The top 10 L-R pairs from each cell type based on their relative contribution under
  incoming patterns. E-F) Dot plot showing three datasets shared specific ligands
  (E) and receptors (F) genes for each cell type. The color scale represents the scaled
  expression average of each gene, while the dot size represents the percentage of
  cells expressing each gene'
