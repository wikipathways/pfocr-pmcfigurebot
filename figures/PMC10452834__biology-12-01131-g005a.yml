caption: (a) Disposition of citrate and polyamines in relation to the glutamine–methionine
  bicycle in normal prostate. The importance of the GTωA pathway (i.e., l-glutamine
  transaminases linked to ω-amidase) in closing the methionine salvage pathway is
  shown in cycle 1. This salvage pathway is especially important in the prostate due
  to the excretion of high levels of polyamines in the seminal fluid. Cycle 2 shows
  the importance of the GTωA pathway for the production of anaplerotic α-ketoglutarate,
  which feeds into the TCA cycle. Under normal conditions, a large amount of the TCA
  cycle carbon in the prostate is not completely oxidized to CO2 but rather is involved
  in the production of the extraordinarily high concentrations of citrate that are
  excreted into the seminal fluid. Reproduced from [3] with permission. (b). Disposition
  of citrate and polyamines in relation to the glutamine–methionine bicycle in cancerous
  prostate. In cancerous prostate, a smaller (but still substantial) amount of citrate
  is present in the seminal fluid compared to normal prostate. In the cancerous tissue,
  a relatively large amount of citrate carbon is channeled toward lipid (and cholesterol/steroid
  hormone) biosynthesis for the cancer cells’ “selfish” biosynthetic needs. In particular,
  androgen-independent prostate cancer cells can synthesize testosterone directly
  from cholesterol by upregulation of a biosynthetic pathway ordinarily present in
  testes and adrenal glands. In addition, inactive adrenal-derived androgens, such
  as dehydroepiandrosterone and 4-androstene-3,17-dione, can be converted to active
  androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) by aldo-keto reductase family 1,
  member C3 (AKR1C3), typically localized to stromal and prostatic endothelial cells
  [191,192]. Reproduced from [3] with permission
