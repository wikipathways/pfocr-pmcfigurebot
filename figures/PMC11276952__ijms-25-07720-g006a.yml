caption: 'Mechanistical regulation of LCAA-PSF in the IMQ-induced mouse psoriasis.
  IMQ+LCAA-PSF versus IMQ group shows (A) the top 20 gene ontology biological process
  (BP) terms with the highest statistical significance. The vertical axis is the GOBP
  terms, and the horizontal axis is the number of genes. The top 20 gene ontology
  molecular function (MF) terms with the highest statistical significance. The vertical
  axis is the GOMF terms, and the horizontal axis is the number of genes. The top
  20 gene ontology cellular component (CC) terms with the highest statistical significance.
  The vertical axis is the GOCC terms, and the horizontal axis is the number of genes.
  GOBP database (B) skin development pathway, (C) epidermis development pathway, (D)
  activation of innate immune response pathway, (E) vascular endothelial growth factor
  signaling pathway, (F) keratinocyte differentiation, (G) small molecule catabolic
  process GSEA signatures in IMQ+LCAA-PSF were compared with IMQ. NES and p value
  were obtained by GSEA in the HALLMARK database. (H) Heatmap representing the relative
  expression levels of selected the top 6 genes (Pdgfrb, Pik3cb, Vegfd, Robo1, Nrp1
  and Tgfbi in yellow background indicated angiogenesis pathway; Grhl1, Rock1, Stfa3,
  Cstdc6, Kazn and Tgfb2 in purple background indicated keratinocyte differentiation
  pathway, respectively) expressed from GOBP database with the highest statistical
  significance. (I) Expression of TGFβ, Ki67, CK 5/6 and VEGF from dorsal skin samples
  was detected by IHC staining at 60× magnification. (J) Quantitative analysis of
  expression level of TGFβ, Ki67, CK 5/6 and VEGF. Data are mean ± SEM. * p < 0.01
  IMQ vs. Con group and IMQ+LCAA vs. Con group, # p < 0.01 IMQ vs. IMQ+LCAA-PSF group.
  a: control group; b: IMQ group; c: IMQ+LCAA group; d: IMQ+LCAA-PSF. Statistical
  analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests'
