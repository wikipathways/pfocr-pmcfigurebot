caption: PPM1G participates in the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma
  and liver fibrosis via different pathways. i) In the occurrence and development
  of HCC, multiple transcription factors and co-activators are activated, promoting
  the expression of PPM1G. PPM1G can target and dephosphorylate SRSF3, leading to
  the dissociation of SRSF3 from the pre-mRNA of CASP8 and PRMT1. Consequently, SRSF3
  loses its ability to regulate the alternative splicing of these pre-mRNAs, thereby
  promoting the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. ii) PPM1G can promote the
  proliferation of HCC cells by enhancing the expression of GOF mutant p53. iii) PPM1G
  can target and inhibit WWP2, which leads to the overactivation of the Notch3/HES1
  signaling pathway, promoting the development of liver fibrosis. HCC, hepatocellular
  carcinoma; PPM1G, protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1G; SRSF3, Ser/arginine-rich
  splicing factor 3; PRMT1, protein arginine methyltransferase 1; GOF mutant p53,
  gain-of-function mutant p53; WWP2, WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase
  2; HES1, hes family bHLH transcription factor 1; CASP8, caspase 8; sh, short hairpin
