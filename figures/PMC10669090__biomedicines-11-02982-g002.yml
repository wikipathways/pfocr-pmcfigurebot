  bone mass.
caption: Mechanisms of the influence of risk factors on the formation of peak bone
  mass. The figure shows a simplified version the molecular mechanisms of modeling
  and remodeling of bone tissue and possible factors of an endogenous and exogenous
  nature that can influence certain links of pathogenesis. MCSF—macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; TNFRSF11 (RANKL)—tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 11 (tumor necrosis
  factor ligand superfamily member 1); PGE2—prostaglandin E2; SCFAs—short-chain fatty
  acids; OPG—osteoprotegerin; SOST—sclerostin gene; DDK1- Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway
  inhibitor 1; OSX1—osteoblast-specific transcription factor Osterix; RUNX2—runt-related
  transcription factor 2; + denotes positive influence; − negative influence
