figure_title: 'Expression of PDK1 and TGF-β/Smad pathway-related genes in yellow cattle
  and yak PASMCs under normoxic and various time-limited hypoxic conditions: (A,C,E,G,I,K,M,O,Q,S,U,W)
  are the relative mRNA expression of genes related to PDK1 and TGF-β/Smad signaling
  pathways in yellow cattle PASMCs; (B,D,F,H,J,L,N,P,R,T,V,X) are the relative mRNA
  expression of genes related to PDK1 and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways in yak PASMCs.'

  The results were normalized to the normoxic (control) groups of yellow cattle and
  yak, respectively; ns indicates the differ ence is not significant (p > 0.05), *
  indicates the difference is significant (p < 0.05), ** indicates the difference
  is significant (p < 0.01), *** indicates a highly significant difference (p < 0.001)'
