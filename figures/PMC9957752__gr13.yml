caption: Model for Smo-mediated protection from steatosis and lipotoxicity. In healthy
  livers (left), subpopulations of hepatocytes that express essential Hedgehog (Hh)
  pathway signaling components (eg, Ptch and Smo) are exposed to Hh ligands that are
  released from neighboring cells (eg, hepatic stellate cells) and escape the soluble
  Hh ligand inhibitors (eg, Hhip) that their neighbors also produce. These “free”
  Hh ligands interact with Ptch on the surface of hepatocytes and this permits activation
  of Smo to initiate intracellular signaling cascades, one of which leads to the phosphorylation/activation
  of AMPK. Activated AMPK, in turn, restricts activation of mTORC1 (a kinase that
  can inhibit both insulin signaling and autophagy). High AMPK activity or low mTORC1
  activity limits accumulation of SREBP1c (a lipogenic transcription factor) and supports
  autophagy of both lipid droplets and damaged mitochondria. Hence, hepatocytes that
  can activate Smo are sensitive to insulin inhibition of gluconeogenesis and do not
  become fatty because they have little de novo lipogenesis, are capable of lipophagy,
  and are enriched with healthy mitochondria that can oxidize fatty acids. In diseased
  livers (right), stromal cells downregulate their production of Hhip and stressed
  cells upregulate their production of Hh ligands. All types of liver cells that retain
  the ability to activate Smo remain sensitive to insulin (a factor that promotes
  cell viability and proliferation) and are protected from lipotoxcity, enabling their
  outgrowth and thereby dynamically reconfiguring the hepatic microenvironment to
  support eventual repopulation of the liver with healthy hepatocytes. However, this
  healthy regenerative process is not possible if the hepatocyte compartment is unable
  to activate Smo because Smo-deficient hepatocytes struggle to activate AMPK and
  thus, exhibit overactivation of mTORC1 which reduces their sensitivity to insulin
  while impairing clearance of damaged mitochondria and promoting synthesis of lipid
  substrates that can be oxidized. In aggregate, these responses enhance hepatocyte
  vulnerability to oxidative stress and lipotoxicity that results from peroxidation
  of cellular lipids. Lipotoxicity is a dynamic process that can be catalyzed by iron
  and prevented or reversed by factors that limit production of H2O2, constrain accumulation
  of lipid targets, or enhance the activity of enzymes that detoxify lipid peroxides.
  Thus, Smo-deficient cells that experience lipotoxic stress can undergo adaptations
  that permit their recovery or at least, delay their ultimate demise. The latter
  response leads to accumulation of Smo-deficient hepatocytes and these metabolically
  stressed hepatocytes that are no longer able to regenerate amplify their production
  of Hedgehog ligands and other paracrine wound-healing signals. This promotes fibrogenic
  repair, which attempts to nurture the outgrowth of hepatocyte replacements. However,
  repair is destined to be futile or maladaptive unless the hepatocyte population
  is able to activate Smo and prevent further lipotoxicity. LSEC, liver sinusoidal
  endothelial cell.
