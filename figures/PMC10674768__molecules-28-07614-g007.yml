caption: SHCBP1 compensates for the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on B16 cell proliferation
  through ERK signaling pathway. Four experimental groups were set up. No load + dimethyl
  sulfoxide (Vector + DMSO), no load + resveratrol (Vector + Res), overexpression
  + dimethyl sulfoxide (OE + DMSO), overexpression + resveratrol (OE + Res). (Aâ€“E)
  After overexpression of SHCBP1, B16 cells were treated with resveratrol for 48h
  and Western blotting was used to detect the expression of SHCBP1, Cycling D1, p21,
  p-ERK. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001, n = 3
