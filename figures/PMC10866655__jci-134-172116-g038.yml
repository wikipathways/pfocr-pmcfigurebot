figure_title: Transcriptomic heterogeneity of ECs in Tbx4LME-Cre Tsc2KO mouse lung
caption: '(A) UMAP representation of Tsc2WT and Tsc2KO mouse lung (n = 2) scRNA-Seq,
  with cell populations labeled according to the corresponding cell type. (B) ECs,
  marked by Pecam1 and vWF expression, were reclustered into 6 subclusters. (C) Mesenchymal
  cells, marked by Pdgfrα, Pdgfrβ and Msln expression, were reclustered into 8 subclusters.
  (D) Distribution of each EC type within the EC subclusters. (E) GO enrichment analysis
  of the AEC cluster. (F) Violin plot demonstrating increased expression of Bmp4,
  Pparg, and Sox17 in AECs from Tsc2KO mice compared with AECs from Tsc2WT mice. (G)
  Wnt signaling pathway network (chord diagram) with incoming signal to AECs from
  3 mesenchymal cell populations including Axin2 myofibrogenic progenitors, Wnt2-Pdgfrα
  cells, and mesothelial cells. (H) Representative images of 54-week-old Tsc2WT (n
  = 3) and Tsc2KO (n = 3) lung for pS6 (marker of mTORC1 upregulation; magenta); light
  green reflects an autofluorescence from structural proteins in lung mesenchyme.
  DAPI (blue) was used to detect nuclei. Scale bars: 20 μm and 100 μm. (I) Representative
  images of dual staining of 54-week-old Tsc2WT (n = 3) and Tsc2KO (n = 3) lung for
  Axin2 mRNA (magenta) and pS6 (green). Scale bars: 25 μm and 50 μm. (J) Quantification
  of the Axin2 mRNA data shown in I. (K) Pulmonary vasculature in both Tsc2WT and
  Tsc2KO with Wnt2 mRNA (magenta) and pS6 (green) from single-molecule fluorescent
  ISH. Scale bars: 25 μm and 50 μm. (L) Quantification of the Wnt2 mRNA data shown
  in K. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, by 2-tailed t test'
