caption: MoCbp7 cooperates with calcineurin to regulate ER homeostasis in M. oryzae.
  (A) Wild-type 70-15, ΔMocbp7, and Mocbp7C were cultured in the dark for 9 days in
  MM medium supplemented with 5 mM DTT or 1 μM TUNI; bar, 1 cm. (B) Relative growth
  rates of wild-type 70-15, ΔMocbp7, and Mocbp7C under DTT and TUNI stress. (C) Relative
  expression of UPR-pathway-related genes in the ΔMocbp7 mutant compared with wild-type
  70-15 after incubation in CM medium. (D) Relative expression of UPR-pathway-related
  genes in wild-type 70-15 after 10 μg/mL FK506 treatment for 1 h. Statistical differences
  were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 8.0 via Tukey’s test (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01).
  (E) The ER-phagy levels of wild-type 70-15 and ΔMocbp7 were detected by western
  blot in liquid CM or 6 h of 5 mM DTT treatment. (F) ER-phagy level of wild-type
  70-15 in liquid CM and after treatment with FK506 was detected. In order to exclude
  the influence of the FK506 solvent on the determination results, dimethyl sulfoxide
  (DMSO) was used in wild-type 70-15. GAPDH was used as a control
