caption: Involvement of CD133 in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in cancer cells. PI3K—phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; Akt—RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (a.k.a. protein kinase B
  alpha); MDM2—E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mdm2; p53—transformation-related protein
  53; MKP-1—protein kinase phosphatase-1; MAPKs—mitogen-activated protein kinases;
  JNK—c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase; BCL-2—B-cell lymphoma 2 protein, apoptosis regulator;
  BCL-XL—anti-apoptotic protein, BCL2 family member; MCL-1—apoptosis regulator, BCL2
  family member. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD133 is able to physically
  bind to PI3K. Created with BioRender.com
