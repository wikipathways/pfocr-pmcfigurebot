figure_title: Generation of the PcdhgS/A and PcdhgCTD mice
caption: 'A, Schematic representation of (top to bottom): the mouse clustered protocadherin
  loci, comprising Pcdha, Pcdhb, and Pcdhg clusters; the Pcdhg locus, comprising 22
  variable exons (γA-subtype: light blue, γB-subtype: dark blue, and γC-subtype: purple)
  which are spliced to three constant exons (black); Pcdhg transcripts comprising
  one large variable exon and three constant exons; and the resultant γ-Pcdh protein
  domain structure, with six extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, a transmembrane
  (TM) domain, a short variable cytoplasmic domain (VCD; all encoded by the variable
  exon) followed by a shared cytoplasmic domain (encoded by the three constant exons).
  B, Schematic of the FAK/PKC/MARCKS signaling pathway identified in Garrett et al.
  (2012) and Keeler et al. (2015) in the presence (B) and absence (C) of γ-Pcdh constant
  domain phosphorylation. Pink lines represent actin filaments. D, Schematic representation
  of (top to bottom): the wildtype γ-Pcdh protein with an intact constant domain;
  the serine-to-alanine mutation in PcdhgS/A, and the C-terminal deletion in PcdhgCTD.
  E, sgRNAs targeting the third constant exon to generate PcdhgS/A (blue) and PcdhgCTD
  (red), resulting in a thymine-to-guanine point mutation and insertion of an early
  stop codon, respectively. F, Chromatograms of PcdhgS/A and PcdhgCTD genomic DNA
  sequencing compared to wildtype'
