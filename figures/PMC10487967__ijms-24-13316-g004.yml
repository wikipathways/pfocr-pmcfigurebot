caption: 'The cGAS–STING pathway in cancer. (A) In certain cancers, the cGAS–STING
  pathway induces autophagy-dependent cell death to limit the transformation of normal
  cells into cancerous cells. (B) The cGAS–STING pathway inhibits the growth of certain
  cancer cells by inducing the secretion of anti-proliferative molecules that promote
  senescence. (C) In specific cancers, 2′3′-cGAMP from the cancer cells enters the
  cytosol of DCs through the gap junction or TEX, activating STING to produce type-I
  IFN. The type-I IFN from the DCs then cross-primes CD8+ T cells to eliminate tumorigenic
  cells. (D) Within some cancers, 2′3′-cGAMP from the cancer cells is transferred
  into non-tumor bystander cells via the gap junction and activates STING, resulting
  in the recruitment of NK cells to restrain tumor growth. (E) In the case of certain
  cancer cells, chemical treatments cause the introduction of damaged DNA into the
  cytosol. This damaged DNA further engages the cGAS–STING pathway, inducing the secretion
  of DMBA to facilitate inflammation and maintain the tumor microenvironment. (F)
  STING activation also occurs after 2′3′-cGAMP from specific cancer cells are trafficked
  to astrocytes via the gap junction. The activated STING in the astrocytes promotes
  STAT1 and NF-κB production, further facilitating the development of metastatic cancer
  cells. (G) The loss of function of cGAS or STING leads to immunosuppression in cancer
  cells due to the hindered production of type-I IFN and other cytokines. Abbreviations:
