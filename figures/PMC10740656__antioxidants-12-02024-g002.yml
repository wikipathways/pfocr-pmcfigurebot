caption: A high UPR status is associated with poorer pulmonary function in patients
  with IPF. (A) UMAP clustering plot based on a marker gene set of the unfolded protein
  response (UPR). (B) Heatmap showing the differential gene expression profiles between
  Cluster 1 and Cluster 2. (C) Following GSEA analysis, the pathway of the UPR, based
  on Hallmark, Reactome, and GO biological process, was found to be significantly
  enriched in Cluster 1 patients. (D) GSVA-derived histogram of pathways of two clusters,
  the UPR pathway was most enriched in Cluster 1. Intercept is the top ten most significant
  pathways in the upward and downward regions, respectively. (E) The box plot showed
  a significant difference in pulmonary lung indices between UPRhigh and UPRlow groups.
