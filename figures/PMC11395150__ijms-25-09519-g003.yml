caption: Overview of the signaling pathways involved in AVF dysfunction and potential
  therapeutic molecular targets. Taking VSMC as an example, after AVF surgery, PDGF
  secreted by ECs and other cells binds to PDGFR on the cell membrane of VSMC, which
  activates the intracellular PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and leads to increased
  expression of genes related to proliferation, differentiation, and regulation of
  ECM. PDGFR inhibitor and rapamycin can inhibit PDGFR and mTOR to protect AVF. At
  the same time, in cells with activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, the protein
  level and activity of HIF-α are increased. In addition, the hypoxia environment
  caused by AVF surgery causes HIF-α to enter the nucleus and combine with HIF-β to
  form a complex to obtain transcriptional activity, which binds to the hypoxia-responsive
  element consensus sequence on the promoter of target genes to activate the expression
  of genes related to cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Bortezomib and oxygen therapy
  inhibit HIF-α activity and nuclear translocation, thereby inhibiting neointimal
  formation. Vascular injury and ischemia–reperfusion injury activate the oxidative
  stress response, which oxidizes LDL to ox-LDL and is taken up by VSMC. LPA released
  by ox-LDL regulates PPAR-γ activity and thus affects the proliferation and apoptosis
  of VSMC. Statins and pioglitazone protect AVF, respectively, by reducing LDL levels
  and activating PPAR pathway levels
