figure_title: Enrichment of metabolites using KEGG pathways (A–C).
caption: 'Enrichment of metabolites using KEGG pathways (A–C). (A): DG vs. CK. (B):
  HG vs. CK, (C): YG vs. CK. The horizontal axis represents the enrichment factor
  for each metabolic pathway, whereas the vertical axis lists the names of the metabolic
  pathways. The color of the circles reflects the p-value, with redder hues indicating
  a greater degree of enrichment. Furthermore, the size of each circle is proportional
  to the number of enriched metabolites'
