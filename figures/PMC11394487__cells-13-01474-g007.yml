figure_title: PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
caption: PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. AKT activates nitric oxide through NOS3 and promotes
  vasodilation and angiogenesis. AKT interacts with CDKN1B, MAP3K8, MAPK8IP1, MDM2,
  and RAF1 proteins to form complexes and inhibits BAD, FKHR, GSK3, MAP3K5, MAPK8IP1,
  RAF1, and TSC1/2 to promote cell survival and growth, cell cycle progression, energy
  storage, protein synthesis, vasodilation, and angiogenesis
