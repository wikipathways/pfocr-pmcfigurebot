caption: Ehmt2 inactivation modulates the epigenetic landscape of mouse pancreas towards
  stress-related pathways. (A) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on Differentially
  Expressed Genes (DEGs) from RNA-seq conducted on pancreas tissue from mice at Postnatal
  (PN) day 10 and young adult (YA) 4–5 weeks, with and without Ehmt2, is shown. (B)
  Venn diagram illustrates the variation in DEGs upon Ehmt2 knockout (Ehmt2 fl/fl
  ) in the pancreas compared to Ehmt2 wild-type (Ehmt +/+ ) mice for YA and PN cohorts.
  (C) MSigDB Hallmarks and Reactome pathway enrichment analyses reveal the activation
  of functional pathways for DEGs in Ehmt2 fl/fl animals compared to their respective
  Ehmt2 +/+ counterparts. (D) QuanTIseq deconvolution analysis predicts immune cell
  composition based on the percentage of total immune cells.

  landscape and inflammation response of the whole pancreas.
