caption: The connection between lncRNAs and subpathways during PFA. (A) Subpathway
  enrichment bubble plot during PFA, a larger p-value (âˆ’Log10) indicates a higher
  degree of enrichment. (B) Radar chart displaying the rank of lncRNAs in follicles
  (upper panel) and granulosa cells (lower panel) during PFA. The direction of the
  red circle represents the rank from largest to smallest value. Right heat map showing
  the expression level of top-rank lncRNAs in follicles and granulosa cells. (C) The
  predicted connection among lncRNAs, target genes, subpathway genes, and POI-related
  genes
