figure_title: The in cellula glucosylation by UGGT1 of Trop-2-EYFP (WT and Q118E mutant)
caption: '(A) The synthesis and modification of N-linked glycans starting from the
  dolichol-PP-Man9GlcNAc2 stage within the ER lumen. ALG6 appends the first glucose
  onto the immature glycan using dolichol-P-glucose as the source. The mono-glucosylated
  glycan is then built into a tri-glucosylated carbohydrate by ALG8/10 prior to covalent
  linking to the nascent peptide chains. The glycan is trimmed to a mono-glucosylated
  state by glucosidases I and II, whereupon it can bind ER lectin chaperones. Removal
  of the remaining glucose by glucosidase II dissociates the glycoprotein from the
  lectin chaperones, whereby three options are possible: continuation of trafficking,
  degradation, or reglucosylation by the UGGTs. Orange ovals represent dolichol anchors,
  yellow circles phosphates, blue squares GlcNAc, green circles mannose, and blue
  circles glucose. (B) Alteration of glycan synthesis pathway for glucosylation studies.
  Deletion of ALG6 results in a Man9GlcNAc2 glycan being transferred to nascent chains
  by the OST as the initial glucose can no longer be added. Interaction with ER lectin
  chaperones is thereby facilitated solely through glucosylation by the UGGTs. Further
  enrichment is achieved through treatment with DNJ, preventing the removal of the
  inner glucose. (C) The designated cell lines were transfected with either the WT
  Trop-2-EYFP or Q118E mutant and lysed. The lysate was split between a whole cell
  lysate sample (20%) and a GST-CRT (35%) and GST-CRT-Y109A pulldown (35%) and resolved
  by 9% SDSPAGE before transferring to a PVDF membrane. Imaged is an αEYFP immunoblot.
  Data represent three independent biological replicates. (D) Mock transfection to
  measure background binding of αEYFP antibody against whole cell lysate from each
  cell line. The membrane was also probed against GAPDH as a loading control. (E)
  Quantification of blots from (B). Percent glucosylation was calculated by subtracting
  the amount of protein pulled down in the Y109A lane from the CRT for each cell line.
  The resulting value was divided by the normalised quantified protein within the
  whole cell lysate and multiplied by 100. Error bars represent the standard deviation.
