figure_title: Transcriptome analysis on goose primary cells transfected with IGFBP2
  overexpression vectors and empty vectors.
caption: Transcriptome analysis on goose primary cells transfected with IGFBP2 overexpression
  vectors and empty vectors. (A) Quantitative PCR showed that IGFBP2 mRNA expression
  was significantly higher in the cells transfected with IGFBP2 overexpression vectors
  than in the control group. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs identified in this
  study was displayed using a dot chart, with the horizontal axis indicating the ratio
  of annotated DEGs on a specific KEGG pathway to the total number of annotated DEGs,
  and the vertical axis indicating the KEGG pathways. The adjusted p-value (p-adj)
  was represented by color-coding, while the number of DEGs was denoted by the dot
  size. The results indicate a significant difference between goose primary hepatocytes
  transfected with IGFBP2 overexpression vectors and empty vectors. The KEGG pathways
  enriched with the up-regulated or down-regulated DEGs are shown in Supplementary
  Figure S1. (C) DEGs from the transcriptome analysis were randomly selected and validated
  using quantitative PCR in goose primary hepatocytes transfected with either the
  IGFBP2 overexpression vector or the empty vector control group. The mRNA expression
  of the genes of interest was determined by qPCR, while the protein expression was
  determined by immunoblot analysis. *, ** denote p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 versus the
  control, respectively. n = 6. The internal reference gene was β-actin and all data
  are presented as the mean ± SEM
