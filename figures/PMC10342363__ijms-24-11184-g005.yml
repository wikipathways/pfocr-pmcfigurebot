figure_title: Levels of regulation of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (SMs)
  in fungi.
caption: 'Levels of regulation of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (SMs)
  in fungi. (a) A particular gene from a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is “silent”
  under normal physiological conditions, in the absence of a stimulating effect from
  the regulatory system. The absence of their transcription is associated both with
  the absence of the necessary transcription factors and with the functional state
  of these loci, which are in the form of heterochromatin. (b) The activation of a
  gene from the BGC as a result of coordinated regulation at the levels of (i) pathway-specific,
  (ii) cross-cluster, (iii) global cell, and (iv) global secondary metabolism (at
  the epigenetic level), (v) mediated by regulatory molecules. The antibiotic penicillin
  G is given as an example of a SM synthesized due to BGC activation. Green and purple
  arrows show transcription factor binding sites, curved cyan arrow indicates the
  start of transcription. Cross symbols on these arrows indicate that binding sites
  are not available for transcription factors. Pathway-specific regulators: ApdR—Zn(II)2Cys6
  regulator for aspyridone A and B BGC (PKS/NRPS hybrid); FsqA—Zn(II)2Cys6 regulator
  for fumisoquin BGC (NRPS); FmpR—Zn(II)2Cys6 regulator for fumipyrrole BGC (NRPS);
  CicD—regulator with Myb-like DNA-binding domain for cichorine BGC (PKS); AntN—Zn(II)2Cys6
  regulator for aspercryptin BGC (NRPS); XanC—bZIP transcription factor for xanthocillin
  BGC (isocyanide synthase); GliZ—Zn(II)2Cys6 regulator for gliotoxin BGC (NRPS);
  LaeA—Zn(II)2Cys6 regulator for lovastatin BGC (PKS). Cross-cluster regulators: PbcR—Zn(II)2Cys6
  regulator for ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene BGC (terpenoid), which also downregulates
  penicillin cluster, two putative PKS clusters, and one putative NRPS cluster and
  upregulates one siderophore BGC; PexanC—bZIP transcription factor for upregulation
  of xanthocillin BGC, which also upregulates citrinin BGC; ScpR—transcription factor
  with C2H2-type zinc finger for upregulation of fellutamide B BGC (NRPS), which also
  upregulates asperfuranone BGC (PKS); RglT—Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor, whose
  gene is localized outside the gliotoxin BGC (NRPS), for which it is a positive regulator;
  CefR transcription factor with nuclear targeting signal that downregulates some
  genes from “early” beta-lactams BGC (NRPS) and upregulates some genes from “late”
  beta-lactams BGC. Global regulators: CreA (Cre1)—C2H2-type zinc finger transcription
  factor for glucose catabolite regulation; PacC—C2H2-type transcription factor with
  three zinc fingers for pH regulation; Nre (or AreA)—GATA transcription factor with
  single Cys4 zinc finger for nitrogen regulation; Ada1—C2H2-type transcription factor
  for control of asexual development; Yap1—bZIP-containing transcription factor for
  antioxidant response; HapB, HapC, and HapE—transcription factors from CCAAT-binding
  complex for regulation of redox status and iron starvation; CPCR1—RFX transcription
  factor for morphological development; AcFKH1—forkhead transcription factor for regulation
  of morphogenesis. Epigenetic regulators (including global regulators of secondary
  metabolism). Velvet complex: LaeA—S-adenosylmethionine-dependent histone methylase
  for chromatin remodeling; VelA (VeA), VelB, VelC, and VosA—components of so-called
  velvet complex with velvet domain for interacting with each other and with LaeA
  in the fungal nucleus. COMPASS complex—complex associated with Set1: Set1—histone-lysine
  N-methyltransferase (H3 lysine-4-specific). Mediators: sRNA—small non-coding RNA;
  PA—polyamine; SM—secondary metabolite'
