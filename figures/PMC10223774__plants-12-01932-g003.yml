caption: KEGG enrichment pathway analysis of DEGs in in self- and nonpollinated ovary
  of Camellia oleifera. (A) Annotation of the top 15 KEGG pathways of DEGs in HJNP_HJSP
  gene set. (B) Annotation of the top 15 KEGG pathways for DEGs in HSNP_HSSP gene
  set. (C) Genes with differential expression in hormone signaling pathways in the
  reaction to self-incompatibility in Camellia oleifera ‘Huajin’ and ‘Huashuo’. (a)
  The DEGs in the gibberellin signaling pathways in response to LSI in Camellia oil
  tree. (b) The DEGs in the abscisic acid signaling pathways in response to LSI in
  Camellia oil tree. (c) The DEGs in the cytokine signaling pathways in response to
  LSI in Camellia oil tree. (d) The DEGs in the jasmonic acid signaling pathways in
  response to LSI in Camellia oil tree
