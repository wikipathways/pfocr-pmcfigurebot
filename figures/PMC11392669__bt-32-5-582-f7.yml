figure_title: VSIR promotes the proliferation of CML cells through regulation of the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway ex vivo.
caption: 'VSIR promotes the proliferation of CML cells through regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway ex vivo. (A, B) KBM5 and K562 cells were transfected with FITC-conjugated
  sh-VSIR vectors. Significant green fluorescence was observed in sh-VSIR-transfected
  KBM5 cells (bar: 100 μm). (C) The relative mRNA expression of VSIR in sh-VSIR-transfected
  cells and sh-con cells (p<0.001). (D) CCK-8 results showing that VSIR knockdown
  inhibited the proliferation of KBM5 (p<0.001) and K562 cells (p<0.05). (E) KEGG
  pathway analysis showing enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
  KBM5-sh-con and KBM5-sh-VSIR-3. The enriched KEGG signaling pathways were selected
  to demonstrate the primary biological actions of the DEGs. For the enrichment results,
  p<0.05 or FDR<0.05 was considered to indicate a meaningful pathway (an enrichment
  score of −log10 (P) greater than 1.3). (F, G) Western blots showing that knockdown
  of VSIR in KBM5 and K562 cells significantly downregulated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway (n=3). (H, I) The correlations between the VSIR gene and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  (p<0.001, ρ=0.36) and apoptosis (p<0.001, ρ=0.38) pathway scores were analyzed with
  Spearman’s correlation coefficient. (J) Western blots showing that VSIR overexpression
  in KBM5 and K562 cells significantly increased the activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway. Asterisks (*) indicate significance, *** indicates p<0.001'
