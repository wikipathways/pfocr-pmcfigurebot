caption: The therapeutic mechanism of polyphenols for sleep disorders. Sleep disorders
  are caused by chronic stress and impaired function of neurotransmitters. Phlorotannin
  inhibits the production of ROS. Tea polyphenols attenuate the production of nitric
  oxide (NO) and active oxygen to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as
  enhance the expression and antioxidant capacity of p-ATM and p-Chk2 to reduce DNA
  damage. Rosmarinus acid exerts antioxidant effects by improving the Akt/GSK-3Î²/Fyn
  pathway to upregulate Nrf2 activity, and also increases the expression of glutamic
  acid decarboxylase (GAD65/67) and GABAA receptor subunits to improve sleep disorder
