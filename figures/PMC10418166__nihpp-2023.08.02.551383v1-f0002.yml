figure_title: EGCG inhibits TGFβ-pathway activity in fibroblasts from ILD biopsies
  and identifies sFRP2 as a novel downstream gene
caption: (A) Dimensional Reduction Plot of subsetted and reclustered alveolar & pathologic
  (CTHRC1+, Inflammatory, and HAS1+/BMP Antagonist+) fibroblast subtypes from control
  biopsy (5,225 cells, n = 3) and EGCG biopsy (6,773 cells, n = 4) samples. (B) Fibroblast
  subtype composition by sample type. (C) Volcano Plot of differentially expressed
  genes in alveolar, inflammatory & pathologic fibroblasts subtypes from EGCG biopsy
  vs control biopsy samples, with selected TGFβ-pathway genes labelled, including
  sFRP2. (D) Violin Plot of sFRP2 expression in EGCG biopsy vs control biopsy samples.
  (E) Heatmap of Z-scores from IPA upstream pathway analysis of differentially expressed
  (D.E.) genes in alveolar, inflammatory & pathologic fibroblasts subtypes from EGCG
  biopsy vs control biopsy samples. (F) Violin Plots of selected TGFβ-pathway genes
  split by individual biopsy sample. (G) Overlap between the 100 most upregulated
  genes in the control biopsy vs donor D.E. list and the 100 most downregulated genes
  in the EGCG biopsy vs control biopsy D.E. list. (H) Relative expression of sfrp2
  mRNA in MRC5 fibroblasts treated with TGFβ1 (1 ng.ml−1) and/or a TGFβ inhibitor
  SB4331542 (5mM) for 48 h (n=5). (I) RNAscope for sftpc, krt17 and sfrp2 on an IPF
  biopsy sample, with green arrowheads indicating sftpc+/krt17− cells, yellow arrowheads
  indicating sftpc+/krt17+ cells, and white arrowheads indicating sftpc−/krt17+ cells.
  Representative image of n=3 samples. (J) Quantification of proximity of sfrp2+ cells
  to sftpc+ cells. Statistical significance was determined by 2-tailed t-test (B),
  MAST with adjustment for multiple comparisons (C,D), at nemates.org (G), One-way
  ANOVA tests followed by the Kruskal–Wallis test (H), and by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons
  test (J)
