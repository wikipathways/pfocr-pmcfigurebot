  signaling pathway, regulation of cellular localization, HSP90 chaperone cycle for
  steroid hormone receptor, PID ILK pathway, epithelial cell differentiation, regulation
  of cell morphogenesis and EGF/EGFR signaling pathway. A background and target list
  (abundance peptide in exosomes from 1% to 100%) in METASCAPE online server and prediction
  for homo sapiens were performed with predetermined values
