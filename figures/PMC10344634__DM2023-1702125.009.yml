caption: COPS6 was required for ALDOA accelerating CRC progression through EMT and
  MAPK signaling pathway. (aâ€“d) Western blotting analysis was used to detect the expression
  of the indicated proteins in EMT program in CRC cells. (e, f) The expression of
  key proteins in MAPK signaling pathway was assessed by western blotting
