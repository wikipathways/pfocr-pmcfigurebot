caption: Mechanisms of targeting the Nrf2/HO-1 axis for the treatment of IBD. (a)
  Nrf2/HO-1 activates a series of signaling pathways targeting inflammation, such
  as the NF-κB pathway and the NLRP3 pathway, to reduce the levels of inflammatory
  factors, such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, as well as inducing the production of antioxidant
  enzymes, such as SOD and GSH, to reduce the oxidative stress caused by the aggravation
  of ROS and to attenuate the pathologic inflammatory response of the intestine. (b)
  Activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 axis improves the intestinal microbiota, promotes the
  growth of beneficial bacteria, inhibits the colonization of pathogenic bacteria,
  increases the expression level of tight junction proteins, such as intestinal occludin,
  claudin-1, and ZO-1, and maintains the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier.
  (c) Activation of Nrf2/HO-1 upregulates GPX4 expression, inhibits oxidative stress
  and iron overload, and reduces ROS production, thereby inhibiting intracellular
  iron death and exerting anti-inflammatory effects
