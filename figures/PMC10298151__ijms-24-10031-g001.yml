figure_title: Functional roles of GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation in D2R G
  protein or D2R β-arrestin pathway-mediated ERK activation.
caption: 'Functional roles of GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation in D2R G protein
  or D2R β-arrestin pathway-mediated ERK activation. (A) CTRL-KD and GRK2-KD cells
  were transfected with plasmids encoding [Gprot]D2R or [βarr]D2R. Serum-starved cells
  were stimulated with 10 μM DA for 2 min ([Gprot]D2R-producing) or 10 min ([βarr]D2R-producing).
  Cell lysates from CTRL-KD and GRK2-KD cells were immunoblotted with antibodies against
  p-ERK1/2 (1:1000 dilution) and ERK2 (1:1000 dilution), respectively. Cell lysates
  were immunoblotted with GRK2 or β-actin antibodies. Each KD cell contained approximately
  75% less cellular GRK2. We measured the levels of phosphorylated ERKs (p-ERKs) and
  total ERKs in the same sample and then divided the amount of p-ERKs by the amount
  of total ERKs to obtain the p-ERK/ERK ratio. The p-ERK/ERK ratio provided a normalized
  measure of ERK pathway activation. ** p < 0.01 compared with the corresponding Veh
  group, ## p < 0.01 compared with the DA/CTRL-KD group (n = 3). (B) HEK 293 cells
  were transfected with plasmids encoding D2R-WT or D2R-IC2/3. Serum-starved cells
  were incubated in the presence of 1 μM UNC9994 for 10 min. Lysates were immunoblotted
  with anti-p-ERK1/2 (1:1000 dilution) and anti-ERK2 (1:1000 dilution) antibodies,
  respectively. ** p < 0.01 compared with the Veh group, ## p < 0.01 compared with
  the D2R/UNC9994 group (n = 3). (C) GRK2-KD cells producing D2R were transfected
  with plasmids encoding GRK2-WT or GRK2-K220R. Serum-starved cells were incubated
  in the presence of 1 μM UNC9994 for 10 min. Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-p-ERK1/2
  (1:1000 dilution) and anti-ERK2 (1:1000 dilution) antibodies, respectively. * p
  < 0.05 compared with the Veh group, ## p < 0.01 compared with the WT/UNC9994 group
  (n = 3)'
