figure_title: Secreted ARSs function in cancer
caption: a KARS1 and CARS1 are secreted from cancer cells by TNF-α signaling to induce
  immune responses via macrophages. CARS1 appears to function via TLR2/6; KARS1’s
  functional receptor has yet to be identified. b Upon stimulation with Fas, GARS1
  is secreted from macrophages and induces cancer cell death via CCDH6. Binding of
  GARS1 to CDH6 releases PP2A from CDH6 to deactivate the ERK signaling pathway required
  for cancer cell survival. c Vascular endothelial cells secrete TARS1 upon TNF-α
  or VEGF stimulation, promoting blood vessel formation. d Proteolytic cleavage of
  ARSs induces secretion or activation of their extracellular activities. The N-truncated
  KARS1 generated by caspase-8 is secreted upon serum starvation to induce a proinflammatory
  response. Upon apoptotic signaling, YARS1 is secreted and cleaved via elastase to
  produce the C-terminal EMAP II-like domain and N-terminal mini-YARS1. The EMAP II-like
  domain activates the immune response; mini-YARS1 binds to CXCR1/2 through its ELR
  motif for angiogenesis. Elastase cleaves WARS1 to produce T2-WARS1 upon IFN-ɣ stimulation.
  T2-WARS1 binds to VE-cadherin, leading to inhibition of VEGFA-activated VEGFR signal
  transduction.
