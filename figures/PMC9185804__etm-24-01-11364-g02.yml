caption: Sufentanil reduces the improved cell permeability of OGD/R-induced human
  cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and upregulates the expression levels of
  tight junction proteins. (A) The endothelial barrier function was detected using
  in vitro permeability assay. (B) The expression levels of endothelial barrier function-related
  proteins were detected using western blot analysis. (C) The level of VE-cadherin
  was detected using immunofluorescence. Magnification, x200. Data are expressed as
  the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. OGD/R, oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation;
  VE, vascular endothelial.

  endothelial barrier dysfunction in HCMECs via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
