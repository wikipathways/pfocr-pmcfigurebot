figure_title: (A) A KEGG analysis on the leaf group.
caption: (A) A KEGG analysis on the leaf group. (B) KEGG analysis on the stem group.
  The vertical axis represents pathways, and the horizontal axis represents enrichment
  factors (the ratio of differential genes to the total number of genes in the pathway).
  The size of markers indicates the number of genes, with more intense red indicating
  a smaller Q value. A-J, stems treated with ETH; A-Y, leaves treated with ETH; CK-J,
  control stems; CK-Y, control leaves; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
