figure_title: inCITE analysis reveals a loss of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in disease
  associated nuclei
caption: (A) Dot plots showing relative levels of protein across all cell clusters,
  and within the endothelial and microglial clusters. (B) Violin plot showing histone
  normalized protein levels for p65/NF-kB, TDP-43 and Beta-Catenin in Cluster 1 (disease
  cluster) in comparison to Cluster 3 (healthy control). (C) Density plots illustrating
  the top 10th percentile of protein levels for Beta-Catenin (relative to H3), and
  predicted positive regulation of Wnt signaling pathway by gene expression. (D) GSEA
  plot of Wnt/β-Catenin genes enriched in disease associated cluster 1 (versus all
  other clusters). Gene sets are either genes positively associated with Wnt activation
  in human endothelial cells, or negatively associated with Wnt activation. (E) Feature
  plots showing example genes in the β-Catenin pathway, projected onto the capillary
  UMAP. (F) Violin plots showing Wnt target gene expression across clusters
