  AMPK signaling pathway. AMPK signaling in protein expression in skeletal muscle obtained from participants following 4 weeks supplementation and exercise. (A) Full-length western blots (stain free membrane): AMPK-α—0 min, 30, and 60 min exercise with placebo (lanes 1–3) or G. pentaphyllum supplementation (lanes 4–6); PGC-1α–placebo (lanes 7–9) or G. pentaphyllum supplementation (lanes 10–12): ACC-α–placebo (lanes 13–15) or G. pentaphyllum supplementation (lanes 16–18). (B) Full-length western blots (stain free membrane): phospho-AMPK Thr172; 0 min, 30, and 60 min exercise with placebo (lanes 1–3) or G. pentaphyllum supplementation (lanes 4–6); phospho-ACC Ser79–placebo (lanes 7–9) or G. pentaphyllum supplementation (lanes 10–12). (C) Representative western blot and (D–J) quantification of AMPK-α, phospho-AMPKThr172, AMPK-α phosphorylation relative to total AMPK expression (ratio of p-AMPK to total AMPK), ACC-α, phospho-ACCSer79, ACC-α phosphorylation relative to total ACC expression (ratio of p-ACC to ACC-α) and PGC-1α. Participants were treated with placebo ( n = 13–14) and G. pentaphyllum supplementation (
  n = 13–14) with 30 and 60 munities exercise. Error bars represent the means ± SEM; * p < 0.05 compared to 0 min of the respective supplement. ^ p < 0.05 comparing treatments at the respective time. + p < 0.05 compared to 30 min of the respective supplement. # p < 0.05 time effect of the exercise irrespective of supplementation
