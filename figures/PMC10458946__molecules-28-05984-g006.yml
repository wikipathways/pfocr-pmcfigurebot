  various steps.
caption: STING signaling pathway inhibition by STING-β in various ways and at various
  steps. (A) The splicing of the STING pre-mRNA produces a mature mRNA molecule that
  can be translated to generate a STING-β protein isoform lacking a membrane binding
  domain but has a CTD domain that enables its binding to STING ligands. (B) The interaction
  of STING-β with the cGAMP blocks cGAMP binding to the membrane-bound STING isoform
  resulting in the inhibition of all the upcoming interactions. (C) The cGAMP bound
  STING-β and STING heterodimer complex cannot relocate to the Golgi body due to STING-β’s
  lack of transmembrane domain. (D) STING-β may bind to the free TBK1 and block its
  interaction with the cGAMP-STING homodimer complex preventing the NF-kB and IRF3
  activation and subsequent cytokine production. Image created with BioRender.com,
