caption: 'TGGR suppresses MAPK signaling pathway in vivo. (A and B) Expressions of
  ERK and p-ERK among drosophila proteins were examined by western blot and quantitative
  data was presented. *P<0.05 vs control only group; #P<0.05, ####P<0.0001 vs 0.5%
  SDS only group. (A and C) Expressions of JNK and p-JNK among Drosophila proteins
  were examined by western blotting and quantitative data was presented. ****P<0.0001
  vs. control only group; ###P<0.001, ####P<0.0001 vs. 0.5% SDS only group. p-, phosphorylated'
