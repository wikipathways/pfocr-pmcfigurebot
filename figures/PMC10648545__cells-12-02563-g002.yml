figure_title: The R59W variant activates the NF-κB pathway.
caption: The R59W variant activates the NF-κB pathway. (A) Cartoon model for NF-κb
  reporter plasmid (A1) and luciferase assay illustrating overexpression of R59W variant
  showing increased activation of NF-κB p65 as compared to the wild type (A2). (B)
  illustrates increased phosphorylation of P- NF-κB-P65. (C) illustrates increased
  phosphorylation of P-IKK α/β S176-180. (D) represents image of PCMV6, ANGPTL8 flag,
  and its variant after transfection by Western blot. The data represent the Mean
  +/− SEM of three independent experiments, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001, as determined
  using Student’s t-test, n = 3 (original gel images are available in the supplementary)
