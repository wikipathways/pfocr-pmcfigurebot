  signaling pathway in renal cells.
caption: Alantolactone (AL) inhibits the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Smad3
  signaling pathway in renal cells. Serumstarved rat fibroblast cell line (NRK-49F)
  and human proximal tubule cell line (HK-2) cells were incubated with 2 ng/mL (NRK-49F)
  or 5 ng/mL (HK-2) TGF-β for 24 hours in the presence of AL (0 to 4 μM). (A, B) Measurement
  of TGF-β secretion in TGF-β-stimulated NRK-49F and HK-2 cells with or without 2
  μM AL treatment. (C, D) Western blot analysis of protein expression of p-Smad3 in
  TGF-β-stimulated NRK-49F and HK-2 cells. Quantification of Western blot data is
  from three independent experiments; data are shown as the mean±standard error of
  the mean. (E) Immunofluorescence staining of p-Smad3 (red in NRK-49F; green in HK-2)
  and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) nuclear counterstaining
  (blue) in TGF-β-stimulated NRK-49F and HK-2 cells with or without 2 μM AL treatment
  (20× magnification). aP<0.01 and bP<0.001 vs. control (CON); cP<0.01 vs. TGF-β;
  dP<0.01 vs. control (TGF-β [–]); eP<0.05 and fP<0.001 vs. TGF-β
