caption: GO and KEGG analysis of COVID-19 and NAFLD related to the common genes. (A)
  GO enrichment analysis of DEGs based on their biological processes. (B) GO enrichment
  analysis of DEGs based on their molecular functions. (C) GO enrichment analysis
  of DEGs based on their cell composition. (D) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of
  DEGs. The horizontal axis represents pathway names and the vertical axis represents
  gene proportions; bubble size represents the number of genes; color gradient from
  red to blue indicates enrichment significance from high to low. COVID-19 = coronavirus
  disease, DEGs = differentially expressed genes, GO = gene ontology, KEGG = Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, NAFLD = nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
article_title: Using bioinformatics and systems biology methods to identify the mechanism
  of interaction between COVID-19 and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
