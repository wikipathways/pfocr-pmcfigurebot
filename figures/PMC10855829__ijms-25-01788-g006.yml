caption: 'WIF1 stimulates metabolic activity of chicken prehierarchal GCs (n = 3).
  (A) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The criteria for DEGs
  screening were |log2⁡(FoldChange)| > 1 and p_adj < 0.05. (B) Gene Ontology (GO)
  terms enriched for DEGs. (C) Venn diagram of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) enrichment analyses of DEGs and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of all
  genes. KEGG (all) represents all pathway terms of KEGG analysis. KEGG (p < 0.05)
  represents the result of all results of KEGG analysis filtered with p < 0.05. GSEA
  represents the results filtered by |NES|>1, p_value < 0.05, and FDR < 25%. (D) Heatmap
  of metabolism-related genes. GSEA of significant pathways in WIF1-overexpressed
  and control pre-GCs: cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathway (E), cell cycle
  (F), calcium signaling pathway (G), and toll–like receptor signaling pathway (H).
  (I) Heatmap of the genes involved in the GSEA analysis'
