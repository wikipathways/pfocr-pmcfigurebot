figure_title: Effect of probiotics on the expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  in IPEC-J2 cells.
caption: 'Effect of probiotics on the expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  in IPEC-J2 cells. IPEC-J2 cells were pre-incubated with probiotics (MOI = 100) for
  12 h and then treated with LPS (40 µg/mL) for 12 h. Results are mean ± standard
  deviation for three independent experiments. Significant differences versus Control
  group: # p < 0.05. Significant differences versus LPS group: * p < 0.05'
