figure_title: Inhibition of WNT suppresses EC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis
caption: '(A) Control ECs (n = 6) and LAM ECs cells (n = 3) were treated with 1 μM
  of the WNT inhibitor C82 followed by a proliferation assay as described in Methods.
  (B) Representative images of migration of ECs from LAM lung treated with 1 μM C82
  or diluent (control). Original magnification, ×10. (C) Statistical analysis of LAM
  EC migration calculated as the number of cells/field in control (n = 5) versus 1
  μM C82-treated LAM ECs (n = 5). (D) Representative images from angiogenesis assay
  of control ECs and LAM ECs treated with diluent or 1 μM C82. (E) Analysis of total
  tube length of control ECs compared with LAM ECs was performed using the Angiogenesis
  Analyzer plugin on ImageJ followed by statistical analysis by 2-tailed t test, with
  the control condition taken as 100%. (F) Effect of 10 nM rapamycin and 1 μM C82
  on EC-fibroblast cocultures. (G) EC-fibroblast cocultures of control human ECs with
  control human lung fibroblasts were treated with diluent (control) and stimulated
  with the pan-WNT pathway activator CHIR99021 (3 μM) or WNT2 (100 ng/mL). n = 3 per
  treatment group. Scale bars: 250 μm. (H) Statistical analysis of ECs per field (with
  a minimum of 4 images per well) in cocultures treated with WNT2 was performed using
  a 2-tailed t test, and data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ***P < 0.001 and ****P
  < 0.0001 (A, C, E, and H). Nonparametric t test (Mann-Whitney) (A and E)'
