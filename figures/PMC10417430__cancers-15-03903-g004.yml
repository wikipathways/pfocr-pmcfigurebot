caption: 'Integrative visualization of the N3a effect in p53 signaling pathway: Venn
  diagrams in the upper left half of the figure illustrate the number of the: (1)
  molecules in both omics datasets, (2) deregulated proteins and (3) deregulated mRNAs,
  emphasizing on the divergent effect N3a has on the lymphoma proteome and transcriptome.
  Color-code bar-plot images in the upper right half of the figure (red: up-regulation;
  green: down-regulation) depict an overall common pattern of differential expression
  at the mRNA/protein level for the deregulated p53-related-genes in both omics analyses,
  corresponding to the three lymphoma cell lines of our study. Integrative protein–protein
  interaction network of the N3a-effect on p53-related-genes is visualized in the
  center of the figure using STRING and Cytoscape. Nodes indicate proteins and edges
  indicate the interactions between them, while color depicts regulation (red: increase;
  green: decrease). Around the networks, representative p53-selected proteins clustered
  according to their involvement to other pathways are shown in green–red–black gradient,
  representing the −log10 (adjusted p-value) (red: higher abundance in treated; green:
  lower abundance in treated; black: missing value). Color intensity reflects differences
  in abundance levels. The western blot image of TP3 and MDM2 is also included with
  the bar graphs showing the ratio of each band after the densitometry analysis'
