caption: miR-25 TuD transfer prevents cardiac inflammation via KLF4 expression. (A)
  Representative inflammation markers such as Galetcin-3 and MCP-1 were quantified
  using Western blotting analysis. (B) The expression of representative inflammatory
  cytokines was also evaluated using qRT-PCR analysis (n = 4 for each group). (C)
  Schematic representation of the proposed signaling pathway of miR-25. Data are presented
  as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001.)
