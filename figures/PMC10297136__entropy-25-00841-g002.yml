caption: Comparison of three indicators of the four methods to identify driver gene
  paths in lung. (a) The four methods obtain different accuracies of the pathways
  for different k values. (b) The four methods obtain different coverage of the pathways
  for different k values. (c) The four methods obtain different mutual exclusion of
  the pathways for different k values
