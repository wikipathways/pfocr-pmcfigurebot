figure_title: Biological significance manipulated by SUMOylation in tumors.
caption: Biological significance manipulated by SUMOylation in tumors. Protein SUMOylation
  governs a spectrum of biological effects in tumors, involving protein stability,
  protein-protein interaction, protein translocation, phase separation, transcriptional
  activation, and genomic instability, by which it participates in the disruption
  of cell homeostasis via inducing aberrance of gene expression, cell cycle progression,
  signaling pathway transduction, DNA damage response, RNA metabolism, etc
