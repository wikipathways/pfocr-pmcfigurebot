caption: 'Predicted significant pathways in chicken response to NDV GII and GVII vaccines:
  (a) Twelve significant pathways from GII-vacc DEGs; (b1,b2) Forty-seven pathways
  from GVII-vacc DEGs. DEGs were selected with a-log (p-value) > 2 and an absolute
  z-score was >2 as a cutoff. The number on the top of each bar represents the total
  number of genes contributing to the pathways. Each bar has three colors: green,
  red, and white, represented as down-regulated, up-regulated, and no overlap genes
  with the basic knowledge in IPA. The –log (p-value) of each pathway is indicated
  by the orange line; (c) Heatmap. Comparing GII-vacc and GVII-vacc DEGs shows orange
  boxes as activated pathways, blue boxes as inhibited pathways, and white boxes as
  non-significant pathways. These pathways are filtered with a –log (p-value) > 2.5
  and z-score > 2. The contrast in the heatmap was visualized with a z-score feature
