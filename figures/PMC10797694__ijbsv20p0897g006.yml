figure_title: The EndMT effect of Gremlin1 was dependent on activation of the RhoA/ROCK
  signaling pathway.
caption: The EndMT effect of Gremlin1 was dependent on activation of the RhoA/ROCK
  signaling pathway. (A-D) Effects of Gremlin1 and Fasudil on the migration (A and
  B) and tube formation (C and D) in HURECs at 48h (n = 4-7 for each group). Scale
  bar, 50 μm. (E, F) Western blotting analysis of typical EndMT markers in HURECs
  treated with Gremlin1 or Gremlin1 + Fasudil for 48h. GAPDH was used as the internal
  control (n =3 for each group). (G) Representative images of immunostaining for Vimentin
  (red), Collagen IV (green), αSMA (green) and DAPI (blue) at 48h in ECM, ECM+Gremlin1
  and ECM + Gremlin1 +Fasudil groups. Two channels were merged. Scale bar, 10 μm.
  One-way ANOVA was used to compare the difference. *P < 0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001
  compared with control group
