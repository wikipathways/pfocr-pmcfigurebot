caption: 'GA alleviated LPS-induced cellular oxidative damage(A) Fluorescence images
  showing the level of ROS after treatment with different concentrations of GA and
  subsequent treatment with 10 μg/mL LPS in Caco-2 cells. (B) Quantification of fluorescence.
  The activity of (C) SOD, (D) GSH, and (E) CAT in Caco-2 cells. Data are shown as
  the mean±SEM, n=6. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 compared to the control. #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01
  compared to the LPS group. GA: gallic acid.'
article_title: Gallic acid attenuates LPS-induced inflammation in Caco-2 cells by
  suppressing the activation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway.
