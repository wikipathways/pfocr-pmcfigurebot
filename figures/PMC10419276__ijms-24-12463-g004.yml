  Plot of the Running Enrichment Score (green line) for a gene set as the analysis
  walks down the ranked gene list, including the location of the maximum enrichment
  score (the red line). The black lines in the Running Enrichment Score show where
  the members of the gene set appear in the ranked list of genes, indicating the leading
  edge subset
