caption: Clustering analysis of significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs)
  in groundnut cotyledons in response to A. flavus infection at 0, 30, 48, and 72
  hpi. (A) Heat map and hierarchical clustering of groundnut proteins differentially
  expressed in control and HIGS samples at various time points; (B) Heat map and hierarchical
  clustering of A. flavus proteins differentially expressed in both control and HIGS
  samples at various time points; (C) Schematic showing the effect of RNAi silencing
  of nsdC, veA, aflR, and aflM genes on developmental genes and aflatoxin biosynthetic
  pathway regulatory and biosynthetic genes in HIGS and WT-control lines. The downregulated
  proteins in HIGS lines at 0, 30, 48, and 72 hpi are indicated as red (downregulated)
