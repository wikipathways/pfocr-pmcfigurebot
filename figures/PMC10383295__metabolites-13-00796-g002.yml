figure_title: High levels of ROS promote cancer cell growth, proliferation, invasion,
  and metastasis.
caption: 'High levels of ROS promote cancer cell growth, proliferation, invasion,
  and metastasis. ROS generation can induce oxidative stress, energy metabolism, cancer-promoting
  signal pathways, and other pathways to promote the occurrence and development of
  cancer. Abbreviations: AMPK, adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein
  kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; CAT, catalase; DSBs, DNA double-strand breaks; ERK,
  extracellular regulated protein kinase; GR, glutathione reductase; GPX, glutathione
  peroxidase; GSH, glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; GST, glutathione-S-transferase;
  HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMP-2,
  matrix metalloproteinase-2; MMP-7, matrix metalloproteinase-7; MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; PI3K, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidyl-inositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate; PFKFB3, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; SERPINE1, serine protease
  inhibitor family E member 1; SSBs, single-strand breaks; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor; 8-oxoG, 8-oxoguanine'
