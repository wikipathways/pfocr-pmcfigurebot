caption: Simplified representation of the Maillard reaction showing the formation
  of acrylamide, HMF and some of the many other reaction products, many of which contribute
  to the flavour and aroma of fried, baked, roasted and toasted foods. The pathway
  shown involves the formation of an Amadori compound from a Schiff base produced
  by a reaction between glucose and an amino acid. A related Heyns compound is formed
  from fructose. The deamination, dehydration and fragmentation of these compounds
  give rise to highly reactive carbonyl compounds, including HMF. These may react
  with free amino acids again, giving rise to a plethora of products. Acrylamide and
  HMF are highlighted by red frames. Adapted from [5]
