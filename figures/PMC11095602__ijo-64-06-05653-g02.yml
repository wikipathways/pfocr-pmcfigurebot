caption: Inhibitors that target senescence-related drug-resistant lymphoma cells.
  Manipulating the target inhibitors of SA-β-gal/HSP90/26S protease/AURKA/Bcl-2/Bcl-xL
  and mTOR/NOTCH/JAK pathway inhibitors has been shown to be effective in treating
  lymphoma-resistant cells. In the ageing environment of lymphoma, PD-1 inhibitors
  restrain the combination of T-cells and drug-resistant cells. SA-β-gal, senescence-associated
  β-galactosidase; HSP, heat shock protein; PD-1, programmed cell death 1; PD-L1,
  PD-1 ligand 1; AURKA, aurora kinase A
