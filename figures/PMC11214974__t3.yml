caption: 'GA protected intestinal barrier function against LPS-induced damageCaco-2
  cells were first treated with or without 1, 5, or 10 μg/mL GA for 24 h, followed
  by 10 μg/mL LPS for 4 h. RT-qPCR was used to measure the mRNA expressions of (A)
  Claudin-1, (B) Occludin, and (C) ZO-1, and the data were normalized to β-actin expression.
  (D) Western blot analysis was used to detect the expressions of TJ proteins. Relative
  levels of (E) Claudin-1, (F) Occludin, and (G) ZO-1. (H) Immunofluorescence staining
  for Claudin-1 (green) and cell nuclei (blue). Data are shown as the mean±SEM, n=6.
  *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 compared to the control. #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 compared to the
  LPS group. GA: gallic acid.'
