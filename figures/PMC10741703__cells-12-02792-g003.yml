caption: 'Neurons involved in temperature-related behaviors in Drosophila. (A) The
  TPR-related neurons (left panel) and aging-related Tp neurons (right panel) in the
  fly brain regulate Tp. In the left panel, there are four sets of brain microcircuits
  that are involved in TPR within different time zones. During daytime, two microcircuits
  regulate TPR, one is DN2 (blue color) > DN1p (red color) and the other is TPN-II
  (brown color) > DN1a (green color). During the night, DN2s (blue color) receive
  the DH31 ligand via PDFR to regulate TPR. In predawn, heat stimulates AC (yellow
  color) > sLNv (purple color) > DN2 (blue color) to regulate TPR. In the right panel,
  there are two brain circuits regulating aging-related Tp. In young flies, both the
  β′ system including the PAM-β′2 (red color) > α′β′ MBn (yellow color) > MBON-β′2mp
  (brown color) and β system including the PAM-β1, β2 (blue color) > αβ MBn (green
  color) >MBON-β2β′2a (gray color), contribute to normal Tp. However, in aged flies,
  the dopamine levels in PAM-β′2 are decreased which reduces the cold responses in
  α′β′ MBn and MBON-β′2mp. Consequently, aged flies prefer to stay at lower temperatures.
  The β system still functions in aged flies and is responsible for partial cold-avoidance
  behaviors. (B) The hot stimulus is conveyed through cholinergic mALT neurons (fiber:
  green color, soma: gray color) to α′β′ MBn dendrites and the calyx (pink color region).
  The α′β′ MBn (yellow color) activity is positively correlated with hot-avoidance
  behavior (HAB). In the food-sated state, Dilp2 is secreted from IPCs (orange color)
  to inhibit the hot response of α′β′ MBn by inducing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  which causes a weak HAB. Conversely, Dilp6 is released from the fat body (blue color)
  to inhibit the hot response of α′β′ MBn by inducing the Ras/ERK signaling pathway.
  The inhibition efficiency of Ras/ERK signaling in the hungry state is not as strong
  as that of PI3K/AKT signaling; consequently, flies exhibit strong hot responses
  in α′β′ MBn during the hungry state which contributes to a strong HAB. The MBON-α′3
  and MBON-β′1 (red color) play the roles of transmitting the integrated information
  from α′β′ MBn for proper HAB during different feeding states. TPR: temperature preference
  rhythm. DN1a: anterior dorsal neurons. DN1p: posterior dorsal neurons. DN2: dorsal
  neurons. sLNv: small ventrolateral neurons. TPN-II: second-order thermosensory projection
  neurons. AC: anterior cell. PAM: protocerebral anterior media. MBON: mushroom body
  output neuron. IPC: insulin-producing cell. Dilp: Drosophila insulin-like peptide'
