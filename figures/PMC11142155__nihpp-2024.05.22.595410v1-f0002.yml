figure_title: Metabolic profiling analysis pipeline for infected cells
caption: (A) Ace2-A549 and A549 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 Isolate USA-WA1/2020
  at an MOI of 10. Metabolites were extracted at multiple time points post infection.
  (B) Metabolic profiles are generated following LC-MS detection in the Mass Spectrometry
  Core Facility. (C) Data processing and analysis allows for both global metabolite
  profiling and pathway enrichment analysis. Image generated with Biorender
