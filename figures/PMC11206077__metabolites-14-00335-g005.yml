figure_title: Proteomic alterations and signalling pathway activation after the 12-week
  exercise program.
caption: 'Proteomic alterations and signalling pathway activation after the 12-week
  exercise program. (A) A volcano plot of serum protein changes in responders vs.
  non-responders in response to 12 weeks of exercise intervention. Red indicates corrected
  p-value < 0.05 (only one protein: IL-6). (B) Serum IL-6 levels. FC = log2(fold-change).
  (C) mRNAs from A with uncorrected p < 0.05 subjected to pathway analysis. The pathways
  enrichment p-values were then corrected for multiple testing (q values). (D) The
  median protein levels related to IL-6 Jak/STAT 3 signalling in non-responders (blue)
  and responders (red). * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01. (E) mRNAs from A with uncorrected
  p < 0.05 subjected to network analysis. The diamonds indicate key drivers. Orange
  circles represent the proteins subjected to analysis and also in the network. Grey
  circles are proteins in the network but not in the protein set. NR = non-responder;
  R = responder'
