figure_title: Mast cells recruit Mononuclear Phagocytes via CCL2-CCR2 ligand-receptor
  pair.
caption: Mast cells recruit Mononuclear Phagocytes via CCL2-CCR2 ligand-receptor pair.
  (A) Mast-CCL2 subgroup interact with mononuclear phagocytes via CCL signaling pathway.
  (B) Heatmap showing the importance of cell subgroups as senders, receivers, mediators
  and influencers in CCL signaling pathway. (C) Bubble plot showing cell-cell interactions
  among mast cell subgroups and mononuclear phagocyte subgroups, and Mast-CCL2 subgroup
  recruit mononuclear phagocytes through CCL2-CCR2 ligand-receptor pairs. (D) Violin
  plot presenting the expression levels of CCL signaling pathway genes in mast cell
  subgroups and mononuclear phagocyte subgroups
