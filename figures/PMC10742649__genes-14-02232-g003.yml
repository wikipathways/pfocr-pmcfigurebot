caption: Enrichment of differential expression genes in different years of C. chinensis.
  The vertical coordinate in the graph corresponds to the biological metabolic pathway;
  the horizontal coordinate indicates the percentage of the number of genes enriched
  into each pathway; and the color of the bubbles represents the significance of the
  enrichment, which is indicated by the Q-value, with the more reddish color representing
  the smaller Q-value and the higher degree of enrichment. (A) KEGG Enrichment analysis
  of differential expression genes. (B) GO Enrichment analysis of differential genes
