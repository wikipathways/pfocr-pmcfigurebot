figure_title: Biosynthesis of (2S)-hesperetin by co-culturing the engineered S.
caption: Biosynthesis of (2S)-hesperetin by co-culturing the engineered S. cerevisiae
  and E. coli strains. (a) (2S)-hesperetin synthesis pathway. Red crosses indicate
  blocked metabolic pathways. (b) (2S)-hesperetin synthesis pathway in co-culture
  of S. cerevisiae and E. coli. (c) Efficiency of conversion of NAG and ERD according
  to expression of MpF4′OMT in S. cerevisiae. (d) Expression of MpF4′OMT in E. coli
  and conversion with the addition of NAG or/and ERD. (e) HPLC profiles of S. cerevisiae
  and E. coli co-cultures. All data represent the mean of n = three biologically independent
  samples, and error bars show standard deviation
