caption: Cerulein combined with lipopolysaccharide-induced capillary leakage in SAP
  mice. (A) Serum amylase levels and lipase activity were measured in the control
  and SAP groups (n = 12/group). The mortality rate in each group was 0% (representative
  of three independent experiments). (B) The levels of serum inflammatory cytokines
  IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were measured in both the control group and the SAP group
  (n = 12/group; data represent the results of three independent experiments). (C)
  Representative histological H&E staining maps (n = 6/group) and pathological scores
  of the pancreas and lung tissues were obtained for each group (n = 6/group; data
  represent the results of three independent experiments). Scale = 100 µm. (D) Representative
  Evans blue leakage maps of the pancreas and lung tissues were generated for each
  group (n = 6/group) and then quantitatively analyzed (data represent the results
  of three independent experiments). (E) Wet-dry weight ratios of the pancreas and
  lung tissues were determined for both groups (n = 6/group; data represent the results
  of three independent experiments). (F) Protein levels of pancreatic ZO-1, β-catenin,
  occludin, and AQP5 in the control and SAP groups were examined and quantitative
  analysis (data represent the results of three independent experiments). (G) mRNA
  levels of pancreatic claudin5, connexin43, claudin1, AQP5, and occludin in the control
  and SAP groups were determined (data represent the results of three independent
  experiments). GAPDH was used as a control. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001.
