figure_title: Enrichment of AD GRPa-MAGMA results on GO curation
caption: GRPa was identified by GRPa-MAGMA under Model 1, the model using full genotype
  to detect all pathways associated with strata comparison, and Model 2, the model
  using excluding APOE region genotype to detect pathways associated with six strata
  comparisons and independent from APOE effect. (A) GO GRPa identified in discovery
  (disc) dataset Model 1, (B) GO GRPa identified in replication (rep) dataset Model
  1, (C) GO GRPa identified in disc dataset Model 2 (no-APOE model), and (D) GO GRPa
  identified in disc dataset Model 2 (no-APOE model), no significant result (FDR <
  0.05) in this condition. * indicates the significant GRPas FDR < 0.05. Heatmap intensity
  indicates −log10(FDR). The x-axis shows the heatmap list of the subgroup comparison
  based on different GWAS summary statistics. S represents Schwartzentruber et al;
  K represents Kunkle et al; W represents Wightman et al. (E) & (F) show the semantic
  similarity for significant terms from GRPa-MAGMA in BP and MF, respectively. The
  UpSet plot for overlapping signals between the strata among the disc cohort and
  the rep cohort under Model 1 was shown in (G)
