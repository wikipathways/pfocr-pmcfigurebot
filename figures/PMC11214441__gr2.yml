caption: Genistein Inhibits Macropinocytosis in Colon Cancer Cells(A-D) Illustration
  of the cell membrane with genistein inhibiting macropinocytosis.(B–B′) TMR-dx (red,
  1 mg/mL) uptake in SW480 cells after 1 h of incubation (control)(C–C′) Same as B–B′
  after overnight genistein treatment (250μM). The TMR-dx uptake was reduced.(D) TMR-dx
  uptake quantification for B–C’. Percentage of cells with detectable TMR-dx signal.(E–K)
  Genistein reduces cell growth in SW480 spheroids(F) SW480 spheroids at 96 h of inverted
  drop culture visualized in bright-field (see Methods).(G) SW480 spheroids with the
  same conditions as F after the overnight genistein treatment (250 μM), the sizes
  of spheroids in 3D culture were reduced.(H) Quantification of the spheroid area
  from F and G.(I) TMR-dx (red, 1 mg/mL) uptake in spheroids.(J) After the overnight
  genistein treatment (250 μM), the TMR-dx uptake was reduced in cells treated with
  the same conditions as I.(K) TMR-dx uptake quantification for I and J.All experiments
  with cultured cells were repeated in at least 3 biological replicates.Eight spheroids
  were plated per replicate. Scale bars, B–C′10 μm; F-J 500 μm. Error bars denote
  SEM (n ≥ 3) (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).). (For interpretation of the references
