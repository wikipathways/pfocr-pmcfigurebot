  signaling pathway.
caption: 'Hydroxysafflor yellow A alleviated ferroptosis by activating the HIF-1α/SLC7A11/GPX4
  signaling pathway. (A) The levels of ferroptosis-related proteins were assessed
  by Western blotting (n = 3). (B) The total iron content in cardiac tissue was determined
  using a kit (n = 6). ## p < 0.01 vs. the sham group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs.
  the MI/RI group'
