caption: 'PKP2 knockdown increased endothelial cell leakage by inhibiting the p38/MAPK
  signaling pathway. (A) Following LPS stimulation, dehydrocorydaline upregulated
  the protein levels of ZO-1, β-catenin, occludin, and claudin1 in HUVECs with PKP2
  knockdown according to Western blot analysis (data represent the results of three
  independent experiments). (B) Dehydrocorydaline increased the mRNA expression levels
  of occludin and β-catenin in HUVECs with PKP2 knockdown (data represent the results
  of three independent experiments). (C) Dehydrocorydaline improved the endothelial
  cytoskeleton morphology of PKP2 knockdown under LPS stimulation (data represent
  the results of three independent experiments). (D) Dehydrocorydaline reduced the
  permeability of HUVECs with PKP2 knockdown under LPS stimulation (data represent
  the results of three independent experiments). Dehydrocorydaline: Activator of the
  p38/MAPK signaling pathway. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.'
