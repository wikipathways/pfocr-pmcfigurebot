caption: 'Pathways regulated by DKK-3: insights into DKK-3 functions. (A). In addition
  to signaling by extracellular DKK-3 (see also Figure 2), the DKK-3b variant serves
  as an intracellular regulator of β-catenin signaling and cell proliferation. DKK-3b,
  in complex with β-TrCP, impedes the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, leading
  to the cytoplasmic sequestration, unphosphorylated β-catenin and subsequent inhibition
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. (B). Left pathway: Secreted DKK-3 activates NF-κB signaling
  via a CKAP4-Akt-NF-κB axis. Right pathway: extracellular DKK-3 promotes the differentiation
  of stem cells into vascular smooth muscle cells through the activation of the MEK/ERK/ATF6
  axis. (C). Intracellular DKK-3 prevents cardiac hypertrophy through ASK1/JNK/p38
  signaling pathway activation. (D). Extracellular DKK-3 stimulates the migration
  of HUVEC endothelial cells through the Wnt/planar cell polarity (ROR2-Dvl1-Rac1-JNK)
  signaling pathway. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 18 December 2023)'
