caption: 'A. Relative abundance of extracellular [15N4]hypoxanthine during 8 hours
  of culture of H460 cells treated with DMSO, 25 nM IACS-010759, or both 25 nM IACS-010759
  and 50 μM NBMPR.B. Fractional enrichment of m+4 IMP, GMP, and AMP after 6 hours
  of culture with [15N4]hypoxanthine, following 24-hours of treatment with DMSO or
  25 nM IACS-010759, with or without 50 μM NBMPR (n=3).C. Relative abundance of the
  indicated purine nucleotides in H460 cells after 24 hours of treatment with DMSO
  or 25 nM IACS-010759, with or without 50 μM NBMPR (n=6).D. Growth rates of H460
  cells treated with 50 μM NBMPR, 25 nM IACS-010759, or both (n=8). Data are from
  one of three independent experiments.E. Western blot validating overexpression of
  SLC29A1. Vinculin is the loading control. EV: empty vector; OE: overexpression.F.
