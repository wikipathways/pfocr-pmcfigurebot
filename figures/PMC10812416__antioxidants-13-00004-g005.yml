caption: Alterations in the aortic transcriptional profiles of atherosclerotic pigs
  fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol, and high-fructose diet. (A) KEGG pathway analysis
  showing the enrichment of functional categories. The size of shapes indicates gene
  counts. The dot color indicates significance, and corresponding significance values
  are displayed as log10 (p-value). (B) Gene set enrichment analysis showing significant
  enrichment in sphingolipid metabolism. (C) Heatmap showing the ceramide-generation-related
  genes. The greater the log2 (fold change), the higher the significance. (D–G) qRT-PCR
  analysis of CERS6, ASAH1, SGMS1, and SGPP1 (n = 5). (H) relative expression levels
  of selected genes involved in the NF-қB signaling pathway from the RNA-Seq dataset;
  (I) relative expression levels of selected genes involved in apoptosis from the
  RNA-Seq dataset. (J) The quantification of TUNEL-positive cells (n = 3). (K) The
  quantification of NF-қB-positive cells (n = 4). (L) Representative photographs of
  TUNEL-stained aorta of the NC and HFCF groups of pigs. Green, TUNEL; blue, DAPI.
  Scale bars, 200 and 1000 μm. (M) Representative photomicrographs of NF-қB staining
  in sections of the abdominal aorta in the NC and HFCF groups of pigs. Scale bars,
  100 μm. NC, normal chow; HFCF, high-fat, high-cholesterol, and high-fructose diet.
  All data were assessed using Student’s t-test and are presented as mean ± SEM. *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001
