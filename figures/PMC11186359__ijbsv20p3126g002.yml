figure_title: PM promotes AREG expression in lung cancer cells.
caption: PM promotes AREG expression in lung cancer cells. (A&B) Overlap of genes
  in GO-BP, Reactome, and KEGG pathways expressed in the A549.PM cell line. The cluster
  heatmap shows the expression of 152 genes in the A549.PM cell line compared to the
  A549.Par cell line. (C) Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of genes from the
  two groups. (D) The expression levels of selected up-regulated genes were verified
  by qPCR. (E) AREG mRNA expression in tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue was
  analyzed using records from the TCGA database. (F) Timer 2.0 analysis determined
  the overall survival rates of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and levels of AREG
  expression. *p < 0.05 compared with A549.Par expression
