caption: KEGG enrichment pathway analysis of differential metabolites in comparison
  groups. The greater the rich factor, the greater the degree of enrichment. The color
  from red to green indicates that the p-value decreases in turn. The larger the dot,
  the more metabolites are enriched in the pathway
