caption: Adipose tissue adaptions to the 12-week exercise program. (A) Clustering
  of mRNA levels in adipose tissue between responders and non-responders at baseline.
  Each row is one person, and the white horizontal line indicates non-responders and
  responders. Blue colour indicates lower and red colour higher mRNA levels. The white
  vertical line divides two main clusters, and each column is one mRNA. (B) Pathway
  analysis of the mRNA clusters from A associated with responders and non-responders.
  (C) Mean mRNA levels of adipocyte and macrophage markers. (D) The adipose tissue
  insulin resistance index (product of plasma insulin and NEFA levels). (E) Waterfall
  plot of response in the adipose tissue insulin resistance index. (F) Volcano plot
  of mRNA changes in adipose tissue in responders vs. non-responders in response to
  12 weeks of exercise. * p < 0.05. NR = non-responder; R = responder
