caption: 'CoA metabolism in the host and in Plasmodium spp.: Substrates, biosynthesis
  pathway, and regulation. Plasmodium can acquire CoA precursors both within host
  cells (A) and extracellularly (B). During blood stage development, erythrocytes
  function as host cells, with plasma being the extracellular space. During the mosquito
  stage development, parasites are largely extracellular in the insect host, with
  intracellular transit during the ookinete and sporozoite stages. When parasites
  are intracellular, they utilize substrates from the extracellular space and the
  host cell for CoA biosynthesis, primarily via the canonical biosynthesis pathway,
  where pantothenate is imported into a host cell from the extracellular space (A).
  Pantothenate is transported by a parasite symporter, then enters the Plasmodium
  biosynthesis pathway (Plasmodium enzymes shown in black) via phosphorylation by
  pantothenate kinase (PanK) (B). Phosphopantothenate is subsequently modified by
  phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS) and phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase
  (PPCDC) to generate phosphopantetheine (P-PanSH). P-PanSH is utilized by phosphopantetheine
  adenylyltransferase (PPAT) to generate dephospho-CoA, which is dephosphorylated
  by dephospho-CoA kinase (DPCK) to yield CoA. CoA negatively feeds back on PanK activity,
  which, together with substrate availability, are checks on CoA synthesis (C). CoA
  can be utilized for cellular processes or degraded into phosphopantetheine by endogenous
  hydrolases (D). Phosphopantetheine can enter the CoA synthesis pathway through PPAT,
  it can passively diffuse back into the host cell, or it can be degraded into pantetheine
  (PanSH) by endogenous phosphatases (E). PanSH can be converted to P-PanSH by PanK
  (F). PanSH is imported into host cells and Plasmodium by an unknown transporter
  protein (G). The host cell utilizes its own suite of CoA biosynthesis and recycling
  enzymes (host enzymes shown in red) (H). Importantly, P-PanSH produced by the host
  cell can passively diffuse into the parasite for use in CoA biosynthesis (I). Freely
  diffusing P-PanSH is available in the extracellular space, where degradation of
  pathway intermediates is enzymatically regulated (J). Specifically, CoA is converted
  by hydrolases into P-PanSH, which can then be converted by phosphatases to PanSH.
  PanSH can be converted into pantothenate in the extracellular space by pantetheinase
  (K).'
