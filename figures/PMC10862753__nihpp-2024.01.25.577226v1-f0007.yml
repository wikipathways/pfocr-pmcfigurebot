figure_title: Pediatric HCM are enriched in ECM-related genes compared to adult HCM
caption: A) Lollipop charts for GO over-representation analysis showing top 10 GO
  pathways (Y-axis) ranked by fold enrichment (X-axis; calculated by mutate(x, FoldEnrichment
  = parse_ratio(GeneRatio) / parse_ratio(BgRatio))) in biological processes (left),
  molecular functions (center), and cellular components (right). Colors of circles
  correspond to adjusted-P values and size of circle corresponds to the number of
  genes implicated. B) Enrichment map stratified by pediatric vs adult HCM depicting
  the proportional GO pathway analysis (left) and KEGG pathway analysis (right; only
  pediatric specific pathways met significance). Node size is determined by the number
  of genes within each pathway. C) Boxplots illustrating relative expression level
  derived from activated LAMININ module score (left) and COLLAGEN module score (right)
  stratified by adult versus pediatric HCM. The center line in the box represents
  the median, the top edge of the box shows the upper quartile, the lower edge of
  the box shows the lower quartile, and the whiskers extend x1.5 of the interquartile
  range. P value <0.001 indicated by ***
