figure_title: Production of hiPSC-CFs
caption: (A) Protocol for the differentiation timeline for making hiPSC-CFs from hiPSCs.
  This small molecule-mediated differentiation approach involves modulation of the
  Wnt signaling pathway. Schematic made with BioRender. (B) Phase contrast image of
  hiPSC-CFs. (C) Immunofluorescence staining of hiPSC-CFs illustrates type III intermediate
  filaments with marker vimentin and activated fibroblasts with marker Î±-smooth muscle
  actin, as well as the nucleus stained with DAPI.
