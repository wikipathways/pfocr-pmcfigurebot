caption: Combined analysis between transcriptome and metabolome data. (A) Pearson
  correlation analysis of DEGs and DEMs. The red and blue colors represent positive
  and negative correlations, respectively. “*” indicates p < 0.05. (B) Interaction
  network of hub genes and DEMs. Pink rectangles represent up-regulated hub genes,
  red triangles represent up-regulated DEMs that are significantly positively associated
  with hub genes, and light blue ellipses represent down-regulated DEMs that are significantly
  negatively associated with hub genes. (C) Common pathways between DEGs and DEMs
