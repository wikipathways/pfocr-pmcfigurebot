caption: 'Hypothesis mechanism of X5 in response to high-salinity treatment. Note:
  The metabolic pathways in the figure are, from left to right, the proteasome pathway
  and photosynthetic carbon fixation. The heatmap labeled next to the gene names in
  the figure is the expression of that gene. The heatmap represents samples X5-30,
  X5-45, and X5-60 from left to right. The black arrows in the figure represent the
  direction of metabolism. The red arrows indicate that the nearby genes are upregulated
  or the metabolic pathway is more active'
