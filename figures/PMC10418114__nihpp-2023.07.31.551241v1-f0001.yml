figure_title: Cancer cachexia is associated with a decrease in serum adiponectin and
  a concomitant decline in AMPK/CaMKII signaling in skeletal muscle.
caption: 'Cancer cachexia is associated with a decrease in serum adiponectin and a
  concomitant decline in AMPK/CaMKII signaling in skeletal muscle.A. Principal component
  analysis (PCA) of white adipose tissue (WAT) RNA-Seq samples showing distinct clustering
  between CACS (n=10) and NCACS (n=9) in the KL model.B. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
  (GSEA) of samples in “A” showing the top 18 pathways differentially expressed in
  CACS using the Hallmark dataset.C. Serum levels of Adiponectin in wild type (WT,
  male=10, female=3) and tumor-bearing mice classified either as non-cachectic (NCACS,
  male=16, female=5) or cachectic (CACS, male=9, female=5).D. GSEA comparing CAMKK
  signaling pathway (GO:0061762) in the muscles of 3 different models of cancer cachexia.
  In GSE165856 and GSE107470, the gastrocnemius of CACS (n=10) KL mice are compared
  with those of NCACS (n=10). In, GSE123310 quadriceps of CACS (n=4) mice with Pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma are compared to controls (n=3), and in GSE138464 the gastrocnemius
  of mice implanted with the C26 colon cancer (n=4) cell line are compared to controls
  (n= 6).Data information: Error bars stand for SD. p < 0.05, NES = Normalized Enrichment
  Score. The p-value in panel C was calculated using a two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s
  multiple comparison test'
