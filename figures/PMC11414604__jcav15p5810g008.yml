caption: Daphnoretin triggers PI3K/AKT-dependent apoptotic pathway in vitro. (A) U87
  and U251 cells were treated with increasing doses of daphnoretin, and the proteins
  related to PI3K / AKT signaling pathway were analyzed by Western blot. (B) After
  pretreatment with SC79 for 1 h, the expression levels of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT and p-AKT.
  Data were presented as mean Â± SD or as a representative image, *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 vs. the control group by oneway ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc
  test or two-way RM ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test
