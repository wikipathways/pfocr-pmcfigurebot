caption: Expression analysis of genes in plant hormone signal transduction pathways
  in Aquilaria sinensis in response to mechanical wounding. FPKM values of the individual
  genes were normalized across the rows and the heatmap was visualized in R. Each
  row represents the normalized gene expression level, whereas columns represent different
  conditions
