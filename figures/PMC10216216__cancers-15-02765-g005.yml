caption: (a) Dedifferentiation induction of CD44-CD24+ tumour cells of T47D and BT-474
  lines after exposure to ICG-001 inhibitor; arrows show mammospheres. (b) Cellularity
  changes dynamics of CD44-CD24+ cell culture of T47D cells after exposure to ICG-001
  inhibitor; on the abscissa—time, days. (c) Differential-expressing WNT signalling
  pathway genes at 21 days incubation in CD44-CD24+ cells after ICG-001 treatment
  and CD44-CD24+ cells without ICG-001 treatment; red—CD44-CD24+ cells without ICG-001
  treatment than in CD44-CD24+ cells after ICG-001 treatment, green—vice versa
