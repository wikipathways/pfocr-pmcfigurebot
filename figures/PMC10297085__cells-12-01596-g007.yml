caption: Requirement of higher concentrations of anti-CD3 for the activation of costimulatory
  signaling pathway mediated by Fc−scTNFL proteins. CD4+ (A) or CD8+ (B) T cells (5
  × 104 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed plates precoated with indicated
  concentrations of anti-CD3 antibody in the absence (none) or presence of 1 µg/mL
  of respective Fc−scTNFL proteins for 3 days. Cell proliferation was evaluated by
  MTT assay. Cytokine concentration was determined by ELISA. Data are mean ± standard
  deviation (n = 3) and from one experiment representative of at least two independent
  experiments with similar results. * p < 0.05 for comparison between with and without
  Fc-scTNFL in respective anti-CD3 concentrations (Student t test)
