caption: ATFs participate in carcinogenic processes, anti-carcinogenic processes,
  or mediate immune response through activating various signal-pathways and different
  mechanisms. ATF-1 accelerates tumor development via mitotic signalling pathway or
  forming heterodimers with other proteins. ATF-2 and ATF-1 can inhibit T lymphocytes
  from secreting cytokines. ATF-2 and ATF-5 can combine with oncogene promoter or
  cancer suppressor gene promoter to develop or delay cancer progression. ATF-2 also
  can aggravate tumor epithelial–mesenchymal transition. ATF-5 can arrest tumor cells
  at G2/M to disturb the cell cycle. ATF-3 enhances vascular perfusion and proliferation
  of tumor cells and postpone cancer progression via the Akt signalling pathway. ATF-3
  regulates tumor immunity by forming heterodimers with PD-L1 or NF-kB. PERK-eIF2-ATF4
  results that ATF4 combine with the oncogene promoter to disrupt the expression of
  PUM1. ATF-4 promotes ferroptosis, proteotoxicity, and survival autophagy of cancer
  cells to let them adapt to the stress environment better. ATF-4 also can enhance
  tumor chemosensitivity, which can improve the survival rate of patients. ATF-6 can
  regulate carcinoma progression through mTOR or PERK signalling pathway. ATF6 directly
  binds to the CIP2A promoter, which prolonged the survival of colon cancer cells.
  Both ATF-6 and ATF-7 can regulate innate immunity. ATF-7 can mediate the apoptosis
  and proliferation in some specific cancers.
