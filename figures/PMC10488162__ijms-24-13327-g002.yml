figure_title: The role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in ovarian aging.
caption: The role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in ovarian aging. When exposed to
  oxidative stress, the Nrf2 pathway is active to protect against oxidative stress
  damage under basal conditions. However, oxidative stress increases during ovarian
  aging, but the Nrf2 pathway is inhibited, so apoptosis and ferroptosis increase.
