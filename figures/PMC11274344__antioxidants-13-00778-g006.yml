caption: 'The role of the cancer antioxidant regulation system in therapeutic resistance
  and scientific questions to be solved. Overall, the cancer antioxidant regulation
  system consists of three parts: the transcription factor network (regulator), the
  GSH/TRX antioxidant system (effector), and the NADPH synthesis pathway (facilitator).
  Among them, the important molecules that play a role in therapeutic resistance are
  shown in the figure. Drugs that are currently in clinical trials are also shown'
