caption: Attenuation of MOE and HNK of the Notch signaling pathway. (A) Lack of impairment
  of cell viability by MOE (0.1–10 µg/mL) evaluated by the CCK-8 test in BV2 cells.
  (B) Reduction by MOE (10 µg/mL), HNK (3 µg/mL), and DAPT (3 µM) of the overexpression
  of Jagged1 induced by LPS stimulation in BV2 cells. Prevention of Jagged1 (C) and
  NEXT (D) overexpression by MOE treatment in spinal cord samples of SNI mice. Lack
  of effect by AM251 administration. Representative blots are reported. ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001
