figure_title: mTORC1 Signaling Among Top Gene Sets Enriched in DD LPS.
caption: 'mTORC1 Signaling Among Top Gene Sets Enriched in DD LPS. Of the 288 metabolic
  pathway-related gene sets analyzed by GSEA, the top four ranked gene sets by NES
  are displayed. Gene sets were analyzed based on enrichment of DD LPS (n = 18) compared
  to WD LPS (n = 29). p < 0.05 and FDR (q) < 0.25 were used as cutoffs for significance.
  (A) Hallmark Myc Targets: NES 2.72, FDR < 0.001, p < 0.001, (B) Hallmark mTORC1
  Signaling: NES 1.44, FDR 0.162, p = 0.011, (C) KEGG pyrimidine metabolism: NES 1.69,
  FDR 0.041, p = 0.002, and (D) KEGG purine metabolism: NES 1.35, FDR 0.22, p = 0.025'
