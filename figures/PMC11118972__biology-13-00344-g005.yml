figure_title: Effect of pteF deletion on cell metabolism.
caption: 'Effect of pteF deletion on cell metabolism. Genes enriched in significantly
  different metabolic pathways were mapped to a precursor supply metabolic pathway
  of avermectin biosynthesis. The red, green, and gray colors represent genes with
  up-regulated, down-regulated, and scarcely changed transcription levels at day 2
  (left) and day 6 (right), respectively. The data in the frame represent the absolute
  values of the log2-transformed value (fold change) for the corresponding genes.
  Solid arrows represent a one-step reaction, while dashed arrows represent multi-step
  reactions. The red and green arrow indicate the pathway with enhanced and decreased
  transcription level, respectively. Abbreviations: AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; MalCoA, malonyl-CoA;
  PropCoA, propionyl-CoA; MMCoA, methylmalonyl-CoA; SucCoA, succinyl-CoA; BuCoA, butyryl-CoA;
  EMCoA, ethylmalonyl-CoA; TAG, Triacylglycerol; DAG, 1,2-Diacylglycerol; PA, Phosphatidic
  acid; LPA, Lysophosphatidic acid; Oxa, Oxaloacetate; Cit, Citrate; iCit, Isocitrate;
  Î±KG, 2-Oxoglutarate; Succ, Succinate; Mal, Malate'
