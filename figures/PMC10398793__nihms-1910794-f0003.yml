caption: Based on the log fold change activation score of the canonical pathways of
  MDA-MB-231 vs. MDA-MB-231 EMT breast cancer cell line, this bubble chart displays
  the expected known canonical pathways gene regulation in regular MDA-MB-231 versus
  MDA-MB-231 EMT breast cancer cells in the context of function and disease development.
  The circlesâ€™ size reflects the number of genes involved in the pathway, although
  the color coding is the same as that of the canonical pathway bar graph
