caption: GPR30 signaling pathway. (a) The canonical E2 signaling through ER-α and
  the physical interaction of GPR30 with ER-α are represented. Also, the GPR30 activation
  by E2 is shown (b); this receptor has been associated with an inhibitory Gα-protein,
  which impairs the adenylate cyclase activity and, therefore, the CREB nuclear translocation.
  (c) The βγ units trigger the PI3K/AKT pathway and the transactivation of EGFR through
  the release of HB-EGF. These units also activate the MAPK pathway through SRC/SHP2.
  (d) The EGFR and IL-6 signaling crosstalk at the STAT3 level. (e) The GPR30 and
  IL-6 pathways converge at the SHP2 level, resulting in gene expression. (f) The
  GPR30 antagonist G15 impairs the ligand activation of GPR30, and the Pertussis toxin
  (PTX) inhibits the Gαi activation. Created with BioRender.com
