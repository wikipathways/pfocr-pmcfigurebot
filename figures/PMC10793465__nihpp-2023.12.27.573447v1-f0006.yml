caption: 'a) iNOS protein levels in BMDMs over a timecourse of continual LPS+IFNγ
  stimulation.b) Tyms expression in BMDMs over a timecourse of continual LPS+IFNγ
  stimulation. Data are presented relative to expression in unstimulated cells (0h).c–e)
  Labeled fraction of (c) ATP (M+2), (d) GTP (M+1 and M+3), and (e) UTP (M+1) from
  24h γ−15N-glutamine labeling in unstimulated or stimulated (continually with LPS+IFNγ
  for 48h) WT or Nos2−/− BMDMs, with or without treatment of 200 μM NO donor DETA-NONOate
  (48h). N.d. indicates not detected in this condition.f) Ratio of labeled CTP (M+2)
  to labeled UTP (M+1) from 24h γ−15N-glutamine labeling in unstimulated or stimulated
  (continually with LPS+IFNγ for 48h) WT or Nos2−/− BMDMs, with or without treatment
  of 200 μM NO donor DETA-NONOate (48h). N.d. indicates not detected in this condition.g)
  Left: Relative intracellular dTTP abundance in unstimulated or stimulated (continually
  with LPS+IFNγ for 48h) WT or Nos2−/− BMDMs. Right: Relative intracellular dTMP abundance
  in unstimulated or stimulated (continually with LPS+IFNγ for 48h) WT or Nos2−/−
  RAW 264.7 cells. Data are expressed relative to abundance in WT unstimulated cells.h)
  Expression levels of selected genes in purine and pyrimidine de novo synthesis,
  degradation, and salvage pathways, probed by qPCR in unstimulated or stimulated
  (continually with LPS+IFNγ for 48h) WT or Nos2−/− BMDMs, with or without treatment
  of 200 μM NO donor DETA-NONOate (48h). Data are presented relative to expression
  in unstimulated, untreated WT cells and displayed on a log2 scale as a heatmap.
  Each box represents the mean of n=3 independent samples.i) Tyms expression in unstimulated
  or stimulated (continually with LPS+IFNγ for 48h) WT or Nos2−/− BMDMs, with or without
  treatment of 200 μM NO donor DETA-NONOate (48h). Data are presented relative to
  expression in unstimulated, untreated WT cells.j–k) Relative intracellular abundance
  of (j) hypoxanthine, and (k) IMP in unstimulated or stimulated (continually with
  LPS+IFNγ for 48h) WT or Nos2−/− BMDMs, with or without treatment of 200 μM NO donor
  DETA-NONOate (48h). Data are presented relative to expression in unstimulated, untreated
  WT cells.b–g, i–k) Bar graph with error bar represents mean ± SD (n=3 independent
  samples).b) Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by post
  hoc Dunnett’s test comparing all groups to unstimulated condition (0h). * indicates
  p<0.05; ** indicates p<0.01; *** indicates p<0.001; ns indicates not significant.
  c, e–g, i–k) Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by
  post hoc Tukey’s test. Bars with different lower-case letters (a, b, c, or d) indicate
  a statistically significant difference with p<0.05'
