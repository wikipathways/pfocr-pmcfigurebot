caption: 'SDC2 facilitates the membrane translocation of PDK1 by interacting with
  its PH domain in GC cells. A & B. Association of PDK1 and FGF2 with SDC2 (LC/MS
  analysis, Co-IP assay). C. Interaction of SDC2 and PDK1 in GC cells (Co-IP assays).
  D & E. Interaction of SDC2 and the PH domain of PDK1 (Co-IP assays, using HEK293T
  cells; molecular docking performed by Discovery StudioTM). F. Colocalization of
  SDC2 and PDK1 in AGS and HGC-27 cells (Double immunofluorescent staining). G. Effect
  of SDC2 on membrane translocation of PDK1 (Western blotting of lipid raft). H, I,
  & J. Dependence of the oncogenic function of SDC2 on the PDK1-AKT signaling pathway
  in GC cells (CCK8 assay, Transwell assay, and Western blotting. Scale bar: =100
  Âµm). K. A schematic diagram showing the proposed mechanism'
