figure_title: The effects of dihydroaustrasulfone alcohol (DA) on ROS-dependent inactivation
  of the PI3K/AKT pathway and apoptosis in NPC-39 cells
caption: After pretreatment with 10 mM NAC for 1 h and then treatment with 25 μM DA
  for 24 h, cell viability was measured by (A) MTT assays. (B, C) The percentages
  of apoptotic annexin V+ cells and cell viability were determined by flow cytometry.
  (D) Cellular proteins were prepared, and the protein expression of pAKT and AKT
  was evaluated by Western blot analysis and quantitation of the Western blot signal
  intensities. GAPDH was used as a loading control. The results are presented as the
  mean ± standard deviation, and all samples were measured independently in triplicate.
  *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 (Student’s t-test) indicates the difference between the
  DA and NAC + DA groups. ROS, reactive oxygen species; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; PI,
  propidium iodide
