caption: Studies related to the role of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in Acute
  Myeloid Leukemia. (A) In AML, overexpression of ligands, receptors or transcription
  factors of the Wnt pathway, such as WNT1, WNT2B, WNT10B, FZD4 and LEF-1, entails
  an antiapoptotic effect. (B) Silencing by promoter hypermethylation of Wnt regulatory
  genes, such as SFRPs, DKK1, RUNX3, SOX17 or WIF1, can activate the pathway. Deletion
  of Gsk3β also activates the Wnt pathway. These actions favor aggressive development
  of AML. (C) The inhibition of Foxm1 in KMT2A-rearranged AML LSCs favors the quiescent
  state due to the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway
