figure_title: Transcriptome sequencing analysis of PPD-treated NCI-H1299 cells.
caption: 'Transcriptome sequencing analysis of PPD-treated NCI-H1299 cells. NCI-H1299
  cells were treated with 26 Î¼g/mL of PPD for 48 h followed by transcriptome sequencing
  analysis. (A): Heatmap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Colored bars indicate
  scaled fragments per kilobase million (FPKM) of transcript of each gene (red: High
  expression, blue: Low expression). Dendrograms represent similarities in clusters
  of samples (left) and in levels of gene expression (top). (B): Dot plot of enriched
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Horizontal axis represents
  the ratio of DEGs annotated on certain pathway. The vertical axis represents the
  top 20 pathways with significant enrichment. (C): Integration and visualization
  of gene expression changes on the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling
  pathway map. Red represents upregulated genes after normalization, and green represents
  downregulated genes after normalization'
