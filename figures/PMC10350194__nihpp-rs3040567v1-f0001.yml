figure_title: Apoer2-ICD regulation of ribosome-associated transcripts in vivo
caption: '(A) Rosa26fs-TRAP mice crossed with the Apoer2WT, conditional KO, and cleavage-resistant
  Apoer2 transgenic mice (Apoer2Δ16±19) were injected with lentiviruses expressing
  Cre resulting in a GFP-tagged ribosomal subunit (L10a:GFP) to allow for pull-down
  of ribosome-bound transcripts (intrahippocampal injections; coordinates were AP:
  −2.2, ML: ±1.3, DV, −1.3). Using an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES), Apoer2-ICD[±19]
  was co-expressed to assess the effect of overexpression of either Apoer2-ICD in
  Apoer2WT or rescue of effects of lack of the Apoer2-ICD (B). (C-D) Heatmaps representing
  the proportion of genes altered in Apoer2 transgenic mice that are either rescued
  or not rescued with the Apoer2-ICD[±19] (C) or altered by overexpression of either
  Apoer2-ICD in Apoer2WT or (D) effects of the ICD independent of the lack of ICD-release.
  (E) Enrichment analysis of the ~4700 transcripts differentially translated across
  all conditions, demonstrating enrichment for synaptic compartments, neuronal processes
  and pathways, as well as diseases of the brain. (F) Gene-term network of the ClueGO/Cluepedia
  enrichment analysis of synaptic transcripts annotated in the SynGO database. (For
  each mouse line: Cre-only and Cre+Apoer2-ICD[+19]: n= 4 individual and one pooled
  set of 4 RNA samples, Cre+Apoer2-ICD[Δ19]: n= 4 individual RNA samples)'
