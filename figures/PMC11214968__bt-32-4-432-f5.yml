caption: ASC-EVs have a suppressive effect on TGF-β signaling pathway. (A) Representative
  western blot image showing the effect of ASC-EVs on phosphorylated SMAD2 levels.
  (B) Quantification of α-SMA and p-SMAD2 immunoblotting in activated dermal fibroblasts
  treated for 24 h with PBS or ASC-EVs. Three independent experiments were conducted.
  (C) Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions from dermal fibroblasts
  demonstrating reduced nuclear localization of phosphorylated SMAD2 following ASC-EVs
  treatment. (D) Quantification of α-SMA and p-SMAD2 immunoblotting in activated dermal
  fibroblasts treated for 24 h with PBS or ASC-EVs. Three independent experiments
  were conducted. Statistically significant differences were assessed as compared
  to the controls. Statistical analysis was processed using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  multiple comparison test (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001).
