caption: PI3K/AKT signaling pathway mediated the effects of Sargassum fusiforme polysaccharide
  (SPF 2205) on HEL cells. (A–F) Apoptosis-associated genes in HEL cells were evaluated
  via quantitative real-time-PCR with β-actin, PI3K, AKT, Bcl-xL, Bad, Caspase-9 and
  Caspase-3, respectively. (G,H) Apoptosis-associated protein expression in HEL cells.
  Proteins in tumors were evaluated by Western blot with anti-GAPDH, PI3K, AKT, p-AKT,
  Bcl-xL, Bad, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3 antibodies. (I–O) Blots were scanned, and
  PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, Bcl-xL, Bad, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, and GAPDH expressions were
  measured by densitometric analysis, respectively. The ratios for these proteins
  are shown. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with the control group
