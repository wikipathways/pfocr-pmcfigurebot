figure_title: Metabolic pathway analysis of rice wine before and after fermentation.
caption: Metabolic pathway analysis of rice wine before and after fermentation. Each
  bubble in the diagram represents a metabolic pathway; the horizontal coordinate
  where the bubble is located and the bubble size indicate the influence factor size
  of the pathway in the topological analysis. The larger the bubble is, the larger
  the influence factor. The vertical coordinate where the bubble is located and the
  bubble color indicate the p value of the enrichment analysis (taking the negative
  natural logarithm, i.e., âˆ’lnp). The darker the color, the smaller the p value, and
  the more significant the enrichment degree
