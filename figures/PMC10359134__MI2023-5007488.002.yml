caption: The expression of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway genes, protein, and downstream
  factors in rat renal tissue. (a) Expression of PAR2, PI3K, AKT, and NF-κB genes
  was examined by RT–PCR (n = 20). (b) Expression of PAR2, PI3K, AKT, and NF-κB proteins
  were examined by Western blotting (n = 20). (c) PAR2 localization was examined in
  renal sections using immunohistochemistry. (d) The levels of pro-IL-1β, IL-1β, IL-6,
  MCP-1, TNF-α, and TGF-β in rat kidneys were examined by ELISA assay (n = 20). Data
  are presented as means ± standard deviation. n = 20 per group; ns, not significant.
