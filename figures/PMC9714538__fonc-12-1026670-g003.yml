caption: NF-κB/IL-8 signaling pathway is activated in SCs in the TME. (A) ELISA results
  showed the secretions of IL-8 from SCs were enhanced after co-cultivation with HCT-116
  and HT-29 cells. Gene expression of IL-8 (B) and CCL2 (C) were detected using RT-qPCR
  in SCs and SCs after co-cultivation with HCT-116 and HT-29 cells. (D) Immunofluorescent
  staining results (scale bar, 100 µm) indicated the nuclear translocation of NF-κB
  in SCs after co-cultivation with HCT-116 and HT-29 cells. The arrows showed the
  nuclear expression of NF-κB p65 proteins. (E) Integrated density of NF-κB p65 in
  cell nucleus quantified in each group. (F) The gene expression levels of IL-8 in
  COAD in the TCGA project, the corresponding normal tissues of the GTEx database
  were included as controls. The box plot data were supplied. (G) The expression level
  of IL-8 total protein between normal tissue and primary tissue of colon cancer based
  on the CPTAC dataset. **P<0.01 *P<0.05. AU, arbitrary units; CM, conditioned medium;
