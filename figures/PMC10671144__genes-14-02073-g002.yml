  pathway.
caption: Causal networks in cisplatin treatment and involvement of tumor microenvironment
  pathway. (a) Camptothecin was identified as a master regulator in cisplatin-treated
  samples. The activity z-score of the top 50 master regulators is shown in the heat
  map. (b) Tumor microenvironment pathway-related Fas cell surface death receptor
  (FAS) was located in the plasma membrane in the network of camptothecin in cisplatin-treated
  lung adenocarcinoma. Gene identifiers marked with an asterisk (*) indicate that
  multiple identifiers in the dataset file map to a single gene in the Global Molecular
  Network
