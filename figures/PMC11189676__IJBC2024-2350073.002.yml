caption: 'Representative signaling pathway induced by CD44, E-cadherin, and β-catenin
  relationship: CD44 separates the membrane-associated E-cadherin and β-catenin complex
  and inhibits E-cadherin. The liberated β-catenin migrates from the membrane to the
  nucleus, and then, it activates the cell invasion genes involved in tumorigenesis
