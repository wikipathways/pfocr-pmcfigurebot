figure_title: KMT2D mutations promoted Treg cell trafficking.
caption: KMT2D mutations promoted Treg cell trafficking. (A). The viability of KMT2DR5432Q
  SU-DHL-4 cells (left panel) and KMT2Dkd (right panel) when co-cultured with peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at 1:1 ratio or 1:5 ratio for 72 hours. *p < 0.05
  comparing with Vector or Scramble SU-DHL-4 cells. (B, C). Main sub-clones shown
  by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) mapping of KMT2Dwt and KMT2Dmut
  DLBCL patients. Fractions of relative proportions of main sub-clones. (D). Fractions
  of relative proportions of sub-clones. (E). Pathway enrichment analysis of Treg
  cells in KMT2Dmut or KMT2Dwt patients according to KEGG database. (F). Main sub-clones
  shown by tSNE mapping of KMT2Dwt, KMT2DR5432Q SU-DHL-4 cells, co-cultured with PBMCs
  of 1:5 ratio for 72h. (G). Fractions of relative proportions of PBMC sub-clones.
  (H). Flow cytometry analysis of Treg cells markers (CD25 and Foxp3) in PBMCs, co-cultured
  with KMT2Dwt, KMT2DR5432Q, Scramble, KMT2Dkd SU-DHL-4 and U-2932 cells for 72h
