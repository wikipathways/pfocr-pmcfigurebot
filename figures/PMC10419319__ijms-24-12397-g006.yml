caption: 'Network pharmacology analysis predicts the target pathways of isoalantolactone-regulated
  glycolysis for OC treatment: (A) Venn diagram of targets between diseases and isoalantolactone.
  The 535 target genes of the disease were obtained from GeneCards. The 105 potential
  protein targets for isoalantolactone were obtained from Pharmmapper and SwissTarget.
  The 25 overlapping gene targets are shown. (B) The proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI)
  network diagram. The common targets of diseases and isoalantolactone were uploaded
  to the STRING database. Homo Sapiens was selected to construct the PPI network.
  (C) Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analyses. Green represents biological
  process (BP), orange represents cellular component (CC), and purple represents molecular
  function (MF) terms for GO analysis. (D) The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  pathway enrichment analysis of potential core targets'
