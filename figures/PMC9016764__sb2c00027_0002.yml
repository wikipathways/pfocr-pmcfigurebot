caption: 'Schematic describing a 7-step informatics workflow to identify TFREs (TF
  binding sites) for in silico design of DC-specific promoters: (1) identification
  of highly expressed DC-specific genes, upregulated genes during DC maturation, and
  highly expressed TFs in DCs (monocyte-derived DCs, conventional DCs, and activated
  conventional DCs); (2) extraction of promoter sequences from the eukaryotic promoter
  database and elimination of highly expressed non-DC specific TFs; (3) identification
  of common TFREs in promoter sequences, TFREs of TFs which are peculiar to APCs,
  and highly expressed DC-specific TFs using the target score specificity quotient
  (TSSQ) metric; (4) elimination of TFREs of non-DC specific TFs using the TSSQ metric;
  (5) selection of TFREs of high expressed DC-specific TFs, (6) elimination of TFREs
  of TF with low regulatory potential in DCs using TFdiff encode, Human Protein Atlas
  (HPA), and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) as sources of information; (7) selection
  of TFREs of TFs with high regulatory potential in DCs.'
