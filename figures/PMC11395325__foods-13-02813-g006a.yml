caption: Analysis and RT-qPCR validation of common DEGs in CK vs. HAE and CK vs. HQ.
  (A) Venn diagram of common and unique DEGs among different comparison groups. (B)
  Correlation heat map of common DEGs in CK vs. HAE and CK vs. HQ related to lactation
  process. Redder squares indicate higher expression and bluer squares indicate lower
  expression. (C) KEGG enrichment of common DEGs in CK vs. HAE and CK vs. HQ related
  to lactation process. The abscissa indicates the percentage of lactation-related
  genes in the pathway to the total lactation-related genes. The color of the bars
  represents the −log10(Q value) of enrichment. (D) Effect of HAE and HQ on PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway. Red means the DEGs are up-regulated, and green means down-regulated.
  Effect of 400 μg/mL HAE (E) and 80 μM HQ (F) on PI3K-Akt pathway via RT-qPCR assays.
  Data are mean ± SEM (n = 3); * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
