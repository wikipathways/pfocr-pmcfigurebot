figure_title: Treatment of in vitro giant cell model by inhibition of the PPP
caption: '(A) Fold induction of FBP1 and G6PD mRNA in Con A, IFN-γ, and anti-CD40
  antibodies stimulated (stim) monocytes, as analyzed by quantitative PCR (n = 3).
  (B) Measurement of intracellular NADP and NADPH levels in the in vitro giant cell
  model (n = 4). (C) Schematic diagram of metabolic pathways and inhibitors of glucose
  and NADPH metabolized by the glycolytic system or by the PPP. (D and E) Giemsa staining
  (D) and bar graphs (E) of monocytes stimulated with Con A, IFN-γ, and anti-CD40
  antibodies, with or without DMSO, DPI, FBPi, and 6AN (n = 4). (F and G) Giemsa staining
  (F) and giant cell count (G) of 3 day cultures stimulated with Con A, IFN-γ, and
  anti-CD40 antibodies followed by incubation with DMSO, FBPi, or 6AN for 3 days (n
  = 3–5). (H and I) Giemsa staining (H) and bar graphs (I) of monocytes stimulated
  with Con A, IFN-γ, and anti-CD40 antibodies, with or without DMSO, 6AN, or G6PDi
  (n = 5). Data are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. Scale bars:
  100 μm. (A and B) *P < 0.05, unpaired t test. (E, G, and I) *P < 0.05, Dunnett’s
  multiple-comparisons test'
