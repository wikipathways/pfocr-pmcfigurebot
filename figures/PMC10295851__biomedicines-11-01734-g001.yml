  The atherosclerosis-related lncRNA AC078850.1 was identified using bioinformatic analysis and validated in foam cells: (A) Venn diagram displaying the intersected lncRNAs in GSE120521 and GSE125126; (B) Heatmap of differentially expressed lncRNAs; the red frames: lncRNA AC078850.1; (C) Enrichment analysis of transcriptional factors interacting with lncRNA AC078850.1; the red frames: lipid and atherosclerosis, HIF-1 signaling pathway; (D) The network diagram of HIF-1α targeting genes; (E) The expression levels of lncRNA AC078850.1 in PBMCs of healthy control patients (as well as patients with carotid plaque) were detected using qRT-PCR (n = 9–18); (F) The expression levels of lncRNA AC078850.1 in PBMCs of healthy control patients (as well as patients with single/multiple carotid plaque) were detected using qRT-PCR (n = 6–9); (G) The expression levels of lncRNA AC078850.1 in PBMCs of patients with single carotid plaque, multiple and stable carotid plaque, and multiple and unstable carotid plaque were detected using qRT-PCR (n = 6); (H) Relative expressions of lncRNA AC078850.1, lncRNA AL359183.1 and linc01547 in ox-LDL induced THP-1-derived macrophages were detected using qRT-PCR (n = 6); (I) Subcellular localization of lncRNA AC078850.1 was detected using FISH assay in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells (n = 3, scale bar: 10 μm). The results were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Measurement data were presented as mean ± SD, and Student’s t-tests were used to analyze. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, and ns
