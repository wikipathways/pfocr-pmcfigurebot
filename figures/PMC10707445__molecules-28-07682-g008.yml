  pathway.
caption: Effusanin B inhibited the tumor migration and regulated the FAK signaling
  pathway. (A) A549 cells were photographed at 0 h and 48 h. (B) Data on migration
  rates (%) are shown in the histogram. (C) Western blotting analysis was used to
  evaluate the effects of effusanin B on the expression of FAK and p-FAK. (D) Histogram
  of the relative protein expression level compared with the control group. The results
  are expressed as means Â± SD. *** p < 0.001 versus the control group
