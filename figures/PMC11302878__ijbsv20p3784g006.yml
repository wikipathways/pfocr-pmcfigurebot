  signaling pathway.
caption: OTUB1 promotes the progression of BLCA depending on β-catenin/RIPK3/MLKL/necroptosis
  signaling pathway. A. Relative expression of OTUB1, β-catenin and downstream targets
  following overexpressed OTUB1 with or without XAV-939 (5uM, 10uM) treatment; relative
  expression of OTUB1, β-catenin and downstream targets following knockdown OTUB1
  and/or overexpressed β-catenin. B. The RNA expression of OTUB1, β-catenin, RIPK3
  and MLKL in elevated OTUB1, β-catenin groups with or without XAV-939 treatment.
  C, E, F. MTT assay, clone formation experiments and healing assay showed the proliferation
  ability of BLCA cell following overexpressed OTUB1 with or without XAV-939 (5uM,
  10uM) treatment; coupled with that following knockdown OTUB1 and/or overexpressed
  β-catenin. D. Transwell assay showed the invasion ability of BLCA cells following
  overexpressed OTUB1 with or without XAV-939 (5uM, 10uM) treatment; coupled with
  that following knockdown OTUB1 and/or overexpressed β-catenin
