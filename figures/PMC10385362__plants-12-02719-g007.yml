figure_title: Plant hormone signaling pathway in response to drought stress in E.
caption: Plant hormone signaling pathway in response to drought stress in E. sibiricus
  based on the KEGG database. The values of the heatmap represent the fold difference
  between the comparison groups. X represents drought-tolerant genotype and W represents
  drought-sensitive genotype
