  PDAC
caption: '(A) Representative images of immunofluorescence staining for cGAS (green)
  and DAPI (blue) in KPC and KPC-Brca2–/– shCtrl and shPOLQ cells. Arrows indicate
  micronuclei. The scale bar in the third column, 10 μm, applies to the first 3 columns,
  DAPI, cGAS, and cGAS/DAPI. Column 4, cGAS/DAPI, is a magnified view of the yellow
  boxes in column 3. Column 4 scale bar: 5 μm. (B) Quantification of cells with cGAS+,
  cGAS–, and total micronuclei from A. Each point on the graph represents 1 visual
  field. (C) Representative images of immunofluorescence staining for p-TBK (green)
  and DAPI (blue) in KPC and KPC-Brca2–/– shCtrl and shPOLQ cells. Insets indicate
  magnified views of staining patterns. Scale bar: 20 μm. (D) Quantification of cells
  that are p-TBK+ from C. (E) Representative image of immunofluorescence staining
  for cGAS (green) and DAPI (blue) in NYU318WT and X337-BRCA2Mut shCtrl and shPOLQ
  cells. Scale bar: 10 μm. White arrows indicate cGAS-negative micronuclei. Arrows
  indicated cGAS-positive micronuclei. Insets indicate magnified views of staining
  patterns. (F) Quantification of cells with micronuclei from E. (G) Representative
  images of immunofluorescence staining for p-TBK (green) and DAPI (blue) in NYU318-BRCA2WT
  and X337-BRCA2Mut shCtrl and shPOLQ cells. Scale bar: 20 μm. Data are representative
  of at least 3 independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005. Error
  bars represent the mean ± SEM'
