  metabolism pathways of B.
caption: 'Network diagram of key metabolites in purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism
  pathways of B. plicatilis based on metabolomics analysis. The squares represent
  the changes of each metabolite in the low (0.02 mg/L, abbreviated as L), medium
  (0.1 mg/L, abbreviated as M), and high (0.5 mg/L, abbreviated as H) concentration
  group compared with the control group. GS: glutamine synthetase; XOD: xanthine oxidase'
