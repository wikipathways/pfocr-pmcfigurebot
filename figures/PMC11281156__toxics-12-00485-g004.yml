caption: The effect of TCBPA on the expression of 24 target genes in Jurkat cells.
  (a) Histogram of mRNA expression of 7 target genes related to estrogen signaling
  pathway; (b) heat map of mRNA expression of 17 target genes related to antioxidant
  and inflammatory responses; (c) the dispersion of data on the mRNA levels of 24
  target genes. The experiment was repeated twice with three parallel samples for
  each time. The data are represented as the mean Â± S.D. of three parallel samples
  from a representative result. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to 0.1% DMSO
