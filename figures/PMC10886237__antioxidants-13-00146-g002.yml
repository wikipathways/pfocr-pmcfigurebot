figure_title: Common mediators of fibrosis.
caption: Common mediators of fibrosis. Surgery, ischemia, pressure, drugs, chemicals,
  heavy metals, allergens, diets, radiation, transplantation, etc. stimulate the production
  of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause oxidative damage, structural
  deformation, and functional abnormalities in various organs. These stresses stimulate
  the expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth
  factor (PDGF), Wnt, heat shock proteins (HSPs), etc. The canonical TGF-β signaling
  pathway is mediated by the small mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) and induces
  the expression of the target genes. As a result, the expression of connective tissue
  growth factor (CTGF) is induced and the signaling pathway that it mediates is activated.
  Additionally, the noncanonical TGF-β signaling pathway activates the Wnt signaling
  pathway by suppressing Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) through an extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK)-dependent mechanism. The activation of the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway activates β-catenin and induces the expression of the target genes. The
  TGF-β, CTGF, and Wnt signaling pathways cooperatively induce cell activation, epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), and the expression of fibrogenic genes, such as alpha-smooth muscle
  actin (α-SMA) and collagens to promote fibrogenesis. Sharp red arrows (→) indicate
  stimulation, and blunt blue arrows (⊥) indicate suppression
