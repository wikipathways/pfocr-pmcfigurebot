caption: 'Tryptophan metabolism alterations in stress and mood disorders. TRP is an
  essential amino acid involved in the metabolic pathways for serotonin and KYN. In
  the latter pathway, TRP is first metabolized by IDO1 to KYN. Pro‐inflammatory cytokines,
  such as IL‐6, TNF‐a, and IFN‐y (pink dots) increase IDO1 expression, thus the KYN
  pathway. Increased production of KYN metabolite KYNA and picolinic acid provides
  neuroprotective effects, while increased production of 3‐HK, 3‐OH‐anthranilic, acid
  and QUIN have neurotoxic effects (a). In stress and mood disorders, characterized
  by increased peripheral and central inflammation, TRP‐KYN pathway is favored. Macrophages
  in the periphery and microglia in the central nervous system metabolize TRP through
  the KYN pathway to QUIN, a potent NMDAR agonist, which increases glutamatergic neurotransmission
  and has been linked to depressive behaviors (b). Similarly, in the gut, increased
  stress‐induced inflammation promotes the metabolism of TRP in KYN, diverting serotonin
  production and contributing to TRP depletion. Serotonergic deficiency has been linked
  to gastrointestinal symptoms in mood disorders. Moreover, peripheral TRP depletion
  leads to central reduction in TRP and serotonin, an effect that is linked to mood
  symptoms in the disorders. Abbreviations: 3‐HK, 3‐OH‐kynurenine; IDO1, indoleamine
  2,3‐dioxygenase‐1; KYN, kynurenine; KYNA, kynurenic acid; NMDAR, N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate
  receptor; QUIN: quinolinic acid; TRP, Tryptophan'
