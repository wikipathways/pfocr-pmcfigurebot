caption: Relevance of metabolites in the initiation and progression of colorectal
  cancer Primary bile acids can undergo enzymatic cleavage by gut microbiota, particularly
  anaerobic colonic microbes, to form secondary bile acids. These secondary bile acids
  are subsequently passively reabsorbed into epithelial cells where they can induce
  an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS),
  leading to DNA damage in colonic epithelial cells and promoting the initiation of
  CRC. CRC cells respond by upregulating endogenous lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis
  to support their proliferation, including activation of Î²-oxidation of endogenous
  lipids and cellular respiration91. These metabolic alterations activate fatty acid
  synthetase (FASN) through the mTOR pathway, enabling saturated fatty acids (SFA)
  incorporation into the cancer cell phospholipid membrane, thereby reducing susceptibility
  to free radicals and therapeutic drugs. This tumorigenic process may facilitate
  tumorigenesis and metastasis
