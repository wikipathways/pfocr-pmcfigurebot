caption: Simplified scheme for the conversion of food-derived copper into biovaluable
  copper. (A) Absorption of copper from the intestine. Copper is absorbed via enterocytes
  through CTR1. Transfer through CTR1 is coupled to a reduction to the copper(I) state.
  Copper(I) is bound by the ATOX1 chaperone, which passes it to ATP7A for excretion
  to the interstitial space and subsequent transfer in the bloodstream. (B) In extracellular
  fluid and the bloodstream, copper is oxidized to a copper(II) state and bound by
  serum albumin (SA) and α2-macroglobulin (α2MG). Copper(II), now bound to SA and
  α2MG, is carried to the liver via the portal vein and is then captured by CTR1 at
  the hepatocyte surface. Supposedly, it is reduced at the surface, but the reductase
  is not yet identified; presumably, copper(II) may be reduced by SA [97]. For simplicity,
  the DMT1 pathway and local copper distribution in the enterocyte are not shown.
  (C) In the hepatocyte, copper(I) is trafficked to the Golgi complex by ATOX1 and
  ATP7B, where it is inserted into newly synthesized Cp, which is secreted into the
  bloodstream. Local copper distribution in the hepatocyte is not shown. (D) The holo-Cp
  delivers copper to CTR1 on non-hepatocyte cells, which imports copper into the cells
