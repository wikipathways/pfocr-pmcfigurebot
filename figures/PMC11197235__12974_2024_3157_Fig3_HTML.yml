caption: 'Impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 on HBC gene programs associated with phagocytosis
  and neurologic disease. (A-B) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) phagocytosis diseases
  and functions pathways (A), and neurologic diseases or functions (B), enriched for
  ≥ 3 DEGs, with absolute Z-score ≥ 1 and adjusted P-value < 0.05. Activation Z-score
  represented by color and number of DEGs by circle size, with red color indicating
  pathway activation and blue color indicating suppression. (C-D). Heatmap of gene
  expression in “Cellular Infiltration by Phagocytes” IPA Pathway (C) and “Inflammation
  of Central Nervous System” (D) by cluster. Color represents gene expression level
  (log2 fold change), *adjusted P-value < 0.05. (E). Module score by subcluster in
  comparison to cluster-specific gene expression of single-cell datasets from human
  brain: Microglia and Border Associated Macrophages (Askenase et al., Sci Immunol,
  2021) and Yolk Sac Macrophages and Monocytes (Bian et al., Nature, 2020). Color
  indicates module score'
