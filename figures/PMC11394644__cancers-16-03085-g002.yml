figure_title: Reaction schemes for NAD+-consuming enzymes.
caption: Reaction schemes for NAD+-consuming enzymes. A general reaction mechanism
  for the four types of NAD+-consuming enzymes. (A) Poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerases
  (PARPs) are responsible for protein modification and DNA damage repair through their
  ability to form poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) or mono(ADP-ribose) (MAR) chains. (B) Sirtuins
  (SIRTs) regulate various processes related to metabolism, DNA damage, inflammatory
  response, and general cell survival through the deacetylation of their substrates.
  (C) CD38 and CD157 are membrane-bound cADP-ribose synthases with glycohydrolase
  and ADP-ribosyl cyclase activities that regulate cell adhesion and Ca2+ signaling.
  (D) Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) utilizes the NAM produced in the salvage
  pathway to control histone methylation through the conversion of SAM to SAH, which
  simultaneously produces 1-MNAM. Created with BioRender.com accessed 15 August 2024
