caption: Regulation of ISL on ESR2 and PI3K/Akt signalling pathway in CRC cells. (A)
  Western blot analysis of the protein expression of ESR2, PI3KCG, NF-κB, AKT, P-AKT,
  CDK1, GSK3β, p-GSK3β, Bax and Bcl-2 in CRC cells. (B) The immunofluorescence staining
  results of protein expression of ESR2, PI3KCG, NF-κB, p-GSK3β, Bcl-2 and CDK1 in
  CRC cells. After treatment with various concentrations of ISL (0, 20, 40, and 80
  µM) for 24 h, HCT116 and SW480 cells were collected to detect protein expression,
  with β-actin as endogenous control. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <0.001 vs. negative
