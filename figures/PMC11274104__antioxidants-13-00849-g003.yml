caption: Metabolite profile in muscle of C. carpio stocked at LD and HD. (A) Volcano
  plot of the differential metabolites between LD and HD groups. (B) Numbers and classification
  of the differential metabolites via the LIPIDMAPS database annotation. (C) Numbers
  and classification of the differential metabolites via the HMDB database annotation.
  (D) KEGG pathways enriched by the differential metabolites. (E) Differential metabolites
  related to glycerophospholipids (GPs). (F) Differential metabolites related to fatty
  acyls (FAs). (G) Differential metabolites related to organic oxygen compounds. (H)
  Differential metabolites related to organic acids and derivatives
