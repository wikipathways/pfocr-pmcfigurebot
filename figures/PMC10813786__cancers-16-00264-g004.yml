caption: A predicted protein network linking RA and WNT pathways. (A) Hierarchical,
  agglomerative clustering using NanoString nSolver 4.0 software generated a heatmap
  showing differential expression of 785 mRNAs amongst four treatment conditions.
  Yellow = low expression, blue = high expression, black = negligible expression at
  or below background level. (B) A subset of 248 genes was identified with significant
  fold-change in expression between wt-APC + ATRA versus mt-APC âˆ’ ATRA (Figure S2).
  DAVID analysis identified a list of 14 genes involved in cellular response to RA
  (C). STRING database analysis of the 14 genes identified network interactions shown
  in (B). https://David.Ncifcrf.Gov/ accessed on 27 August 2022 and https://string-db.org/
