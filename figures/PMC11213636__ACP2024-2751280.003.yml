caption: PFD, AGP, and PFD + AGP inhibited the expressions of α-SMA, collagen I, and
  CTGF in activated LX-2 cells. (a) DAPI staining of α-SMA and collagen I (original
  magnification, ×200). (b) The mRNA levels of α-SMA, collagen I, and CTGF were detected
  by RT-qPCR. (c) The protein levels of α-SMA, collagen I, and CTGF were measured
  by Western blot. (d) The quantification of α-SMA, collagen I, and CTGF proteins
  expressions was measured by densitometry analysis.  ∗P < 0.05;  ∗∗P < 0.01;  ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001.
