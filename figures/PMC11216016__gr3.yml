caption: 'Nano-Se regulates FGFR signal pathway during wound healing. (A) CCK-8 assay
  to evaluate proliferation rate of HSF cells induced by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + AZD4547
  (FGFR pathway inhibitor) and Nano-S. (B) Clonal formation assay to evaluate proliferation
  rate of HSF cells induced by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + AZD4547 (FGFR pathway inhibitor)
  and Nano-S. (C) Representative images of edu assay to evaluate the proliferating
  HSF cells induced by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + AZD4547 (FGFR pathway inhibitor) and
  Nano-S. (D) Quantitative analysis of the Edu+ cells induced by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + AZD4547
  (FGFR pathway inhibitor) and Nano-S. (E) Flow cytometry analysis of the proportion
  of edu+/hoechst+ cells treated with Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + AZD4547 (FGFR pathway
  inhibitor) and Nano-S. (F) Quantitative analysis of the edu+/hoechst+ cells induced
  by Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + AZD4547 (FGFR pathway inhibitor) and Nano-S. (G) Representative
  images of the Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + AZD4547 (FGFR pathway inhibitor) and Nano-S
  accelerate caudal fin regeneration. Dpa: days past amputation. (H) Regeneration
  rate of zebrafish caudal fin treated with Nano-Se@S, Nano-Se@S + AZD4547 (FGFR pathway
  inhibitor) and Nano-S on different days. (3 independent biological repeats n = 9).
