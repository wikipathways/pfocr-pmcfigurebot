caption: A schematic diagram for the mechanism underlying the apoVs-mediated rescue
  of the impaired OVX MSCs biological function and their capacity to improve osteoporosis.
  Systemic infusion of WT MSCs or WT apoVs preconditioned OVX MSCs rescue the impaired
  recipient MSCs via the direct cargo and reuse of miR-145a-5p initiating modulation
  of TGF-β1/Smad 2/3 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thus providing a promising
  novel approach of exploring apoVs-based MSCs engineering and expanding the application
  scope of stem cell therapy for osteoporosis
