figure_title: rhKAI1 suppress LPS-induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.
caption: 'rhKAI1 suppress LPS-induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophages
  via blocking of JNK/NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) Relative levels of mRNA expression
  for IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and COX-2 were expressed as fold of control. (B) In the
  supernatants, NO concentration was measured by the Griess reaction. (C) The secretion
  levels of PGE2, IL-1β and IL-6 levels were determined using commercial ELISA kits.
  Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 4). ***P < 0.001 compared to control. ###P
  < 0.001 compared to LPS-stimulated cells. (D) The cells subjected to immunofluorescence
  staining with NF-κB p65 antibody and representative images were acquired using a
  confocal laser scanning microscopy. Green fluorescence indicates the localization
  of NF-κB p65, and blue fluorescence by DAPI allows the nuclei. Scale bar = 50 μm.
  (E) The protein expression of MAPK signaling molecules including ERK, p-ERK, JNK,
  p-JNK, p38 MAPK and p-p38 MAPK. (F) Bar diagram showing the relative protein density
  after normalization with actin based on Western blot analysis. *P < 0.05, **P <
  0.01, and ***P < 0.001 compared to control. ###P < 0.001 compared to LPS-stimulated
  cells'
