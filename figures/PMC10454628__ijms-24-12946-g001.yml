figure_title: (A) A basic anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway.
caption: '(A) A basic anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′,5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; UFGT, UDP-glucose: flavonoid glucosyltransferase.
  (B) Binary vectors for transient expression of MdCHS, MdANS, and MdUFGT1. The pICH31070
  vector, a TMV-based 3′ pro-vector module carrying these three genes. pICH20155,
  a TMV-based 5′ pro-vector for targeting signal. pICH14011, an integrase module for
  recombination 5′ and 3′ pro-vectors modules. LB and RB, left and right borders;
  Pact, Arabidopsis actin 2 promoter; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; MP, movement
  protein; CP, coat protein; Apo, apoplast targeting presequence; int, intron; AttP
  and AttB, recombination sites; Tnos, nos terminator; 3 NTR, 3 nontranslated regions.
  (C) The T-DNA region of binary vectors for stable expression of MdCHS. RB, T-DNA
  right border; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region of the rice α-amylase 3D gene; 35S-p,
  cauliflower mosaic viral (CaMV) 35S promoter; hptII, hygromycin phosphotransferase;
  35S polyA, the terminator of 35S gene; LB, T-DNA left border'
