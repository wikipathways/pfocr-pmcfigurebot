caption: (a) Neoantigen burden and immune escape mutations. Lower bars show antigen
  processing genes (APG) and HLA alterations present in each cancer; (b) Somatic mutations
  in each of the antigen presentation pathway genes. The number in the bottom left
  is the truncating mutation count and the number in the bottom right the number of
  biallelic nonsynonymous mutations. APGs in purple, IFN-Î³ pathway genes in blue,
  epigenetic modifier genes in brown, CD274 comprises the PD-L1 receptor and CD58
  receptor is encoded by CD58. Figure created using BioRender
