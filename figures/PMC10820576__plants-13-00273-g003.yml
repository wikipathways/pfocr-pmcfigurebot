caption: 'Relative expression levels of phytohormone biosynthetic and phytohormone-mediated
  signaling pathway genes and phytohormone levels in the leaves of eggplants cultivated
  with different concentrations (0.5 and 5 mM) of nitrate and inoculated with WFT.
  (A) Gene expression levels of LOX6, AOS3, AOC, OPR3, EDS1, and SABP2 at 0, 3, 9,
  and 24 h in WFT-inoculated eggplant leaves. (B) Phytohormone content of JA, H2JA,
  JA-Ile, JA-Phe, JA-Val, OPDA, MeJA, SA, and SAG measured through LC-MS/MS at 0,
  3, 9, and 24 h after WFT inoculation under N supply. Values are the mean ± SE (n
  = 3). For a significant difference from the indicated samples: * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, or *** p < 0.001 by Student’s t-test. LNWFT, 0.25 mM Ca(NO3)2 for 5 d, infested
  with WFT; HNWFT, 2.5 mM Ca(NO3)2 for 5 d and then infested with WFT'
