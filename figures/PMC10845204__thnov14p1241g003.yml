figure_title: S100a9hi macrophages mediate and amplify the inflammatory response through
  the Myd88/NFκB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.
caption: S100a9hi macrophages mediate and amplify the inflammatory response through
  the Myd88/NFκB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. (A) Volcano plot of the fold-change in differential
  gene expression in day 1 post-MIR and Sham from all cells in the monocyte-derived
  infiltrated macrophages. (B) Volcano plot of the fold-change in differential gene
  expression in heart and peripheral blood from all monocytes of day 1 post-MIR.P-values
  were calculated by Wilcoxon rank sum test and P adjusted values were corrected by
  Bonferroni analysis. (C) Pathway Enrichment analysis of Cluster 2 based on the GO
  database. (D) KEGG pathway analysis of gene in the S100a9hi macrophages with MetaboAnalyst
  5.0. (E) Representative immunofluorescence images of Myd88 and S100a9 co-staining
  of 24 h post-MIR heart tissues. n = 3. All scale bar, 50 μm. (F-G) co-staining of
  Evans blue and TTC to detect infarct area and the quantification of infarct area.
  n = 5. ns, no significance, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, compared to WT-MIR, Student's
  t test. All scale bar, 50 μm. (H-I) The serum LDH, CK-MB, and cTnI level in Sham
  or MIR mouse model. n = 8 in each group. ns, no significance, * P < 0.05, ** P <
  0.01 compared to WT-MIR group, one-way ANOVA. (J-K) Western blots of heart Myd88,
  phospho-NFκB, NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α and the quantification of expression
  on day 1 after MIR and Sham group. n = 5 in each group. ns, no significance, * P
  < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared to WT-MIR group, one-way ANOVA. (L-M) Representative
  images of Tunel assay of heart sections one day after treatment and quantitative
  analysis in each group. n = 5. ns, no significance, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 compared
  to WT-MIR, one-way ANOVA. All scale bar, 50 μm
