caption: Effects of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway on the cell cycle of mMSCs
  during differentiation into AT II cells in vitro. (A) Changes in the cell cycle
  at 7 days of mMSCs differentiating into AT II cells in groups treated with 4 mM
  LiCl or 200 ng/ml DKK-1, respectively (n=3). (B) Changes in the cell cycle at 14
  days of mMSCs differentiating into AT II cells in groups treated with 4 mM LiCl
  or 200 ng/ml DKK-1, respectively (n=3). ****P<0.0001 vs. control group (mMSCs co-cultured
  with MLE-12 cells and small airway growth medium). AT II cells, type II alveolar
  epithelial cells; DKK-1, Dickkopf-related protein 1; E2F4, E2F transcription factor
  4; LiCl, lithium chloride; mMSCs, mouse mesenchymal stem cells

  of bone marrow‑derived mesenchymal stem cells into type II alveolar epithelial cells
  through cell cycle arrest
