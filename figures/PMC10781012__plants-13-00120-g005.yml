figure_title: The proposed biosynthetic pathway of ellagitannins (oenothein B) in
  E.
caption: 'The proposed biosynthetic pathway of ellagitannins (oenothein B) in E. angustifolium
  (modified from data in [39,42]). The metabolic pathway starts with erythrose-4-phosphate
  and phosphoenolpyruvate (not shown in the figure). The enzymes that catalyse the
  individual steps from erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate are the following:
  3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase,
  dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase. Further, the biosynthetic steps
  involve: DQD/SDH—dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase; DHS—dehydratase;
  SD—shikimate dehydrogenase; SK—shikimate kinase enzyme; EPSPS—5-enolpyruvylshikimate
  3-phosphate synthase; CS—chorismate synthase; FMNH2—reduced flavin mononucleotide;
  PAL—phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H—cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL—4-coumaroyl-CoA
  ligase; CHS—chalcone synthase; CHI—chalcone isomerase; chorismate mutase prephenate
  aminotransferase; arogenate dehydrogenase; arogenate dehydratase; PCA—hydroxylase'
