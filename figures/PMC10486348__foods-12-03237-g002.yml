caption: Comparison of fatty acid and amino acid levels in LD muscle of DDBJ and JXB
  pigs, and KEGG enrichment analysis. (a) Comparison of 19 fatty acids in LD muscle
  of DDBJ and JXB pigs. SFA = saturated fatty acid; UFA = unsaturated fatty acid;
  MUFA = monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA = polyunsaturated fatty acid; SFA = C14:0
  + C16:0 + C17:0 + C18:0 + C20:0 + C22:0 + C24:0, UFA = C16:1 + C18:1 + C18:2 + C18:3n6
  + C18:3n3 + C20:1 + C20:2 + C20:3n6 + C20:4n6 + C20:5 + C22:1 + C22:6 n3; MUFA =
  C16:1 + C18:1 + C20:1 + C22:1; PUFA = C18:2 + C18:3n6 + C18:3n3 + C20:3n6 + C20:4n6
  + C20:5. (b) Comparison of 17 amino acid levels in LD muscle of DDBJ and JXB pigs.
  EAA = essential amino acids, EAAΣ = Thr + Val + Met + Ile + Leu; FFAA = fresh flavor
  amino acid, FFAAΣ = Ser + Glu + Pro + Gly + Ala, NEAA = non-essential amino acid,
  NEAA = Asp + Cys + Tyr, Σ = total amino acid. Asterisk denotes significant difference;
  * α = 0.05, ** α = 0.01. (c,d) KEGG pathway enrichment, up- and downregulated differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs); shown are the first 20 pathways
