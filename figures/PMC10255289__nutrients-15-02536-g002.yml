caption: Heatmap of the differential expression of genes involved in the cell cycle,
  p53 signaling pathway and DNA replication in prostate-cancer cells treated with
  Ocoxin. LNCaP cells were treated for 48 h with the 1:50 dilution of Ocoxin. mRNA
  expression levels were measured through mRNAseq in both treated and untreated cells.
  (a) Cell cycle, (b) DNA replication and (c) p53 signaling pathway
