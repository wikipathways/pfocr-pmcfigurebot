figure_title: Pioglitazone prevents cardiac dysfunction under hypoxia by acting through
  a non-insulin signaling pathway.
caption: 'Pioglitazone prevents cardiac dysfunction under hypoxia by acting through
  a non-insulin signaling pathway. (A - B) The raw data of the glucose tolerance test
  (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT), along with the percentage of basal blood
  glucose during GTT or ITT, were recorded for both the control and pio groups under
  normoxic and hypoxic conditions (n = 6). The corresponding area under the curve
  (AUC) was calculated for each mouse in both groups (n = 6). (C-D) Blood glucose
  (n = 6) and plasma insulin levels (n = 3) in control and pio groups under normoxic
  and hypoxic conditions. (E) Western blotting analysis of p - AKT (S473), AKT, p
  - p70S6 and p70S6 expression in mice heart from control and pio groups under hypoxic
  conditions. (n = 3). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 in control group vs. pio group under
  hypoxic conditions. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 in control group under normoxia vs. hypoxia'
