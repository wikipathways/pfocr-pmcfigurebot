caption: Schematic diagram of protective effects on postoperative delirium-like behaviour
  by FPS-ZM1 administration after exploratory laparotomy under sevoflurane anaesthesia
  in aged mice, which may be mediated by the BBB/RAGE signalling pathway. BBB, blood-brain
  barrier; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end-products
article_title: Specific antagonist of receptor for advanced glycation end‑products
  attenuates delirium‑like behaviours induced by sevoflurane anaesthesia with surgery
  in aged mice partially by improving damage to the blood‑brain barrier
