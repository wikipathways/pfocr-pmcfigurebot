figure_title: ANT1A114P and ANT1A114P,A123D clog mitochondrial protein import in human
  cells
caption: '(A) Combining pathogenic mutations in ADP/ATP translocase 1 (ANT1) strongly
  reduces protein levels, as indicated by immunoblot analysis of ANT1-hemagglutinin
  (HA) levels 24 hr after transfecting HeLa cells. ANT1 variant levels were normalized
  by TFAM, then plotted as relative to wild-type level. * indicates p<0.05, ****p<0.0001
  from one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. (B) Immunoprecipitation
  (IP) of ANT1-HA and ANT1A114P-HA from transiently transfected HeLa cells followed
  by immunoblot analysis, showing that ANT1A114P has increased interaction with the
  protein import machinery like its yeast ortholog Aac2pA128P. (C) Quantitation from
  four independent IP, one of which is depicted in (B). p-Values were calculated with
  a Student’s t test. (D) Immunoblot analysis following protease protection assay
  showing that ANT1A114P and ANT1A114P,A123D are sensitive to proteinase K (PK) in
  isolated mitochondria. Swelling in hypotonic buffer was used to burst the outer
  membrane, and Triton X-100 was used to disrupt all membranes. OM, outer membrane;
  IMS, intermembrane space; IM, inner membrane. (E) Quantitation of the wild-type
  and mutant ANT1 pools that are protected from PK degradation in intact mitochondria.
  All HA levels were normalized by TFAM, then plotted as relative to its untreated
  sample. Replicates from three independent transfections. p-Values were calculated
  with a one-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. (F) ANT1A114P and
  ANT1A114P,A123D obstruct general mitochondrial protein import. Proteomics of the
  cytosolic fraction of transfected HeLa cells reveals increase in mitochondrial proteins
  caused by ANT1A114P-HA and ANT1A114P,A123D-HA expression relative to ANT1-HA. p-Values
  were calculated with a Student’s t test of the average abundance levels of each
  mitochondrial protein. (G) Volcano plot comparing the cytosolic proteome of SLC25A4
  p.A114P,A123D vs SLC25A4-transfected HeLa cells. Data represented as mean ± SEM.
  (H) Enrichment analysis of proteins significantly increased in the cytosol of SLC25A4
  p.A114P,A123D-transfected HeLa cells. Depicted are the most significant enriched
  protein groups generated from three different databases: GO: Biological Process
  (top), KEGG pathway (middle), and GO: Molecular Function (bottom). Figure 5—source
