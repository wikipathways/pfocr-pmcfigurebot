caption: Proposed mechanism for the role of AMPK on lipid and glucose metabolisms
  in liver tissue. The MLP treatment activates AMPK activity, which leads to downregulated
  lipogenic enzymes such as ACC and FAS. The results indicate that the AMPK pathway
  may increase glucose transport as well as fatty acid oxidation
