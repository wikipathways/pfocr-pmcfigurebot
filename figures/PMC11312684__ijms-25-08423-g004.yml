figure_title: 'Some key targets in the regulation of cancer cell viability by S-glutathionylation:
  S-glutathionylation may cause changes in cellular metabolism via suppression of
  ATP production (inhibiting NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase) and PPP promotion
  (inhibiting pyruvate kinase M2 and the bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase).'
caption: 'Some key targets in the regulation of cancer cell viability by S-glutathionylation:
  S-glutathionylation may cause changes in cellular metabolism via suppression of
  ATP production (inhibiting NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase) and PPP promotion
  (inhibiting pyruvate kinase M2 and the bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase).
  S-glutathionylation modulates cellular signaling pathways by changing the activity
  of protein kinases (protein kinases A, C, and B; MKK1), protein phosphatases (protein
  tyrosine phosphatase 1B), and Ras proteins, as well as regulating cell survival
  through changes in the activity of transcription factors (NF-κB, p53, STAT3, and
  Nrf2). S-glutathionylation also influences cancer cells’ viability through the regulation
  of their resistance to anticancer drugs (Hsp90, BiP, UCP2)'
