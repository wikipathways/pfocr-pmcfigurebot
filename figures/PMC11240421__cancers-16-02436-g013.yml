figure_title: CK1α interplay in the NF-κB pathway.
caption: CK1α interplay in the NF-κB pathway. CK1α phosphorylates many cellular components
  within the NF-κB signalling cascade to regulate the pathway. RIPK1 is also a substrate
  of CK1α as part of Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) signalling. De-regulated
  CK1α could contribute to increased inflammation in PCa. Created with BioRender.com
