caption: A schematic diagram showing the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway in ramie
  leaves. In this scheme, different metabolites are displayed within dashed boxes
  that form a heat map. Differentially expressed genes are shown next to their corresponding
  enzymes as heat maps. The gene scale corresponds to the relative levels of transcription
  of the enzymes
