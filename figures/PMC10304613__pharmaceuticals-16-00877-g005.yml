figure_title: Knockdown of ACAT1 activates thiamine metabolism and enhances PDH activity.
caption: Knockdown of ACAT1 activates thiamine metabolism and enhances PDH activity.
  (A) The PCA analysis of Be(2)-M17 with ACAT1 knockdown, n = 6. (B) Volcanic maps
  comparing differential metabolites, n = 6. (C) Heat map analysis, n = 6. (D,E) The
  results of metabolic pathway analysis are presented in bubble diagrams and rectangular
  tree diagrams, respectively. (F) Differential metabolites in the thiamine metabolic
  pathway of cells with ACAT1 knockdown, n = 6. (G) The expression of TPK1 increased
  after CHA treatment, n = 3. (H,I) PDH activities. Be(2)-M17 and SH-SY5Y cells with
  CHA (5 μM and 25 μM) treatment or ACAT1 knockdown, n = 3. For (F–I), * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 compared to the control group
