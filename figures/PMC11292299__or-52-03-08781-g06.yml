figure_title: ABT-737-induced production of reactive oxygen species mediates the activation
  of the ASK1-JNK signaling pathway and apoptosis of A2780/DDP cells.
caption: 'ABT-737-induced production of reactive oxygen species mediates the activation
  of the ASK1-JNK signaling pathway and apoptosis of A2780/DDP cells. A2780/DDP cells
  were treated with cisplatin (5 µg/ml) combined with ABT-737 (10 µM) or combined
  with ABT-737 (10 µM) and NAC (100 µM) for 24 h. (A) Western blot analysis of p-ASK1,
  ASK1, p-JNK and JNK protein expression. (B and C) Quantitative analysis of (B) p-ASK1/ASK1
  and (C) p-JNK/JNK protein levels from panel A. Data are presented as the mean ±
  SD of three independent experiments. (D) The cell viability was determined by MTT
  assays. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. (E)
  Hoechst staining analysis of nuclear morphology (scale bar, 10 µm). (F) Quantitative
  analysis of the Hoechst staining-positive cells. Data are presented as the mean
  ± SD of three independent experiments. (G) Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry.
  (H) Quantitative analysis of the flow cytometric results. Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. **P<0.01 vs. the control group;
  #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01 vs. the cisplatin + ABT-737 group. p-, phosphorylated'
