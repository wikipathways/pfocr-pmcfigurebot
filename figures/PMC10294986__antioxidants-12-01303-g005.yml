figure_title: Role of the OLA dietary treatment in the regulation of SLE-related intracellular
  signaling pathways.
caption: 'Role of the OLA dietary treatment in the regulation of SLE-related intracellular
  signaling pathways. Protein expressions of (A) phosphorylated JAK3/STAT-3; (B) the
  Nrf-2/HO-1 axis; (C) the IκB-α and p65/p50 nuclear subunits, and (D) phosphorylated
  P38, JNK, and ERK MAPKs were evaluated in renal homogenates from mice. Densitometry
  was performed after normalization to the control (JNK, ERK, p38, or β-actin). Data
  are represented as the means ± SEM (n = 6). One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post
  hoc test results: # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001 vs. naïve group; * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 significant difference versus SD-pristane group'
