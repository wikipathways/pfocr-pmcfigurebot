figure_title: Rhein induces ROS generation and suppresses the AKT/ mTOR signaling
  pathway in OC cells.
caption: Rhein induces ROS generation and suppresses the AKT/ mTOR signaling pathway
  in OC cells. (A) Cells were treated with increased concentrations of rhein for 48
  h, followed by incubating with 10 Î¼M DCFH-DA for 30 min. The ROS level was determined
  by flow cytometry. (B) Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity is shown
  in histograms. (C) The expression levels of AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, p38, p-p38,
  JNK, and p-JNK were determined by Western blotting. ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001
