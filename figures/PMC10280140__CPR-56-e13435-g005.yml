caption: Activated myofibroblasts (aVICs) exhibit a senescent‐associated secretory
  phenotype (SASP) with a reduced capacity for autophagy. (A) Representative confocal
  immunofluorescent images of ATG7, p21CIP1 and α‐SMA expressions in canine healthy
  and myxomatous mitral valves, scale bar 20 μm. (B) Quantitative analysis of mean
  fluorescence intensity (MFI) of ATG7, p21CIP1 and α‐SMA in canine healthy and myxomatous
  mitral valves. (C) Representative images of co‐localization ratio analysis of ATG7
  (red) and α‐SMA (green), p21CIP1 (red) and α‐SMA (green) fluorescence signals in
  canine mitral valve tissues. (D) Quantitative analysis of co‐localization parameters
  (Pearson's correlation and overlap coefficient) of ATG7 (red) and α‐SMA (green),
  p21CIP1 (red) and α‐SMA (green) fluorescence signals. (E) Representative images
  of SA‐β‐gal (blue) staining and quantitative analysis of the percentage of SA‐β‐gal
  positive cells, scale bar 50 μm (n = 12 microscopic fields/treatment). (F) Cell
  cycle analysis (left panel) and BrdU incorporation assay (right panel) of canine
  aVICs and qVICs (n = 6). (G) Representative western blot of p16INK4A, p21CIP1, p53
  and β‐actin protein expression and quantification of the relative protein expression
  in VICs (two biological replicates shown in blots, n = 6). (H) Quantitative RT‐PCR
  for SASP cytokine expression (left panel) and secreted TGF‐β1, IL‐6 and MMP‐9 (right
  panel) in collected supernatant from VIC cultures (n = 6). Results are presented
  as mean ± SEM. ANOVA followed by Tukey's range test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
  compared to control. ANOVA, analysis of variance; VIC, valve interstitial cell.

  and secretory phenotype of valvular interstitial cells through the modulation of
  cellular senescence in a naturally occurring in vitro canine model of myxomatous
