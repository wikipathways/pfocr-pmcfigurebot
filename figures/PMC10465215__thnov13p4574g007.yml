caption: Endothelial cells and fibroblasts may inhibit the infiltration of T cells
  and NK cells through the MIF signaling pathway. (A) The difference in cell interaction
  number and strength in high- and low-HDS samples was analyzed based on CellChat.
  (B) Circle plot and heatmap show the difference in the number and intensity of interactions
  per cell cluster at high and low HDSs. (C) The tSNE analysis revealed reclustering
  maps of stromal cells. The bubble map shows the marker genes for each cell cluster.
  (D) Stacking plots show the proportion of high- and low-HDS samples in each cluster.
  (E) CellChat was used to analyze communication between endothelial cells, fibroblasts,
  T cells, and NK cells. (F) Bubble diagram and circle diagram showing that SFRP2+
  fibroblasts, MYH11+ fibroblasts, CD234+ endothelial cells and CD69+ fibroblasts
  may communicate with T cells and NK cells frequently through MIF signals in low-HDS
  samples
