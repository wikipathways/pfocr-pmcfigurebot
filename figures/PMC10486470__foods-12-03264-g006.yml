caption: Working model of the signalling hub linking pathogen (Fusarium graminearum)
  infection with asparagine synthetase gene expression in wheat. DON (deoxynivalenol)
  binds to ribosomes and inhibits protein synthesis, leading to the accumulation of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free ammonia (NH4+). DON also induces expression
  of the TaFROG gene, and TaFROG competes with a fungal protein, OSP24, for binding
  to TaSnRK1α, thereby safeguarding TaSnRK1α from degradation. However, the precise
  mechanism through which this signalling pathway ultimately activates the asparagine
  synthetase gene family and the transcription factors involved remain unknown. This
  model is based on an adaptation from [52,55]. Created with BioRender.com
