caption: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) upregulates 5 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) genes
  and 3 mitochondrial genes, induces mitochondrial dysfunction, and increases bioenergetic
  and immunometabolic reprogramming. The gene expression changes of ER protein-encoding
  genes and human nuclear genome DNA-encoded mitochondrion genes (mitocarta) in the
  veins of CKD patients were compared to those of non-CKD controls. (A) CKD significantly
  upregulated 5 ER protein-encoding genes and 3 mitocarta genes and downregulated
  24 ER protein-encoding genes and 16 mitocarta genes in the veins of CKD patients.
  The ER protein-encoding genes were downloaded from the HPA (https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/endoplasmic+reticulum,
  accessed on 5 February 2023) and mitocarta genes from the Broad Institute (https://www.broadinstitute.org/mitocarta/mitocarta30-inventory-mammalian-mitochondrial-proteins-and-pathways,
  accessed on 20 December 2022). (B) The gene expression changes of energy metabolism
  pathways in the veins of CKD patients were compared to those of non-CKD controls.
  CKD significantly downregulated 9 oxidative phosphorylation genes, 2 pentose phosphate
  pathway genes, and 15 glucose metabolism genes and upregulated one TCA cycle gene
  and two glucose metabolism genes. The glucose metabolism (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis)
  pathway genes, TCA cycle genes, pentose phosphate pathway genes, oxidative phosphorylation
  genes, and catabolic pathway genes were downloaded from the HPA. (C) CKD significantly
  upregulated 6 and downregulated 110 catabolic genes. The CKD-downregulated catabolic
  genes are listed in Supplementary Table S10. (D) The gene expression changes of
  human small molecule metabolites-related enzymes, transporters, and other molecule
  genes in the veins of CKD patients were compared to those of non-CKD controls. CKD
  significantly modulates the expression of 355 genes; among them, 39 genes were significantly
  upregulated, and 316 genes were downregulated in the veins of CKD patients. The
  316 significantly downregulated genes were listed in Supplementary Table S11. (E)
  Metascape pathway analysis showed the top pathways of the 39 CKD-upregulated metabolomic
  proteins. The human small molecule metabolites-related enzymes, transporters, and
  other molecule genes were downloaded from the human metabolome database (HMDB) (https://hmdb.ca,
  accessed on 20 December 2022). (F) A schematic diagram shows that CKD/uremic effects
  on the vein affect the cellular immunometabolic reprogramming required for energy
  metabolism in the cells
