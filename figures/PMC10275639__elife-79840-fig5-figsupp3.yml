figure_title: PRRX1 knock-down globally impacted TGF-β pathway response in NHLF
caption: '(A–C) NHLF lung fibroblasts were first treated with control siRNA (#1 or
  #2) or with PRRX1 siRNA (#1 or #2) for 48 hr in the absence or presence of TGF-β
  for an additional 48 hr. RNA was extracted and analyzed at 96 hr using whole genome
  microarrays (n=2). (A) Dot blots showing normalized mean expression of PRRX1 and
  TGFBR2 in the different conditions (n=2). (B) Box plots showing the attenuation
  of the TGF-β response by PRRX1 siRNAs on the 597 most modulated genes by TGF-β in
  control conditions (threshold: log2 fold change >2, adj. p-Value <0.05, see ). Average
  attenuation of the TGF-β response is 44.4 and 20% with siRNA#1 and #2, respectively.
  (C) Venn diagram showing the most affected genes following PRRX1 KD within the TGF-β
  signature in NHLF. Figure 5—figure supplement 3—source data 1.The zip folder contains
  the data presented in panel A (in an Excel document).'
