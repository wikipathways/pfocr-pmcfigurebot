figure_title: ZNF471 could interact with BANP to inhibit the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signalling pathway.
caption: 'ZNF471 could interact with BANP to inhibit the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signalling pathway. A-B. Transcriptome sequencing in renal cancer cell lines overexpressing
  ZNF471. C. KEGG functional enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes.
  D. The anticancer effects of ZNF471 through inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation.
  E. Proteins with direct interactions with ZNF471, including MIS18A, BANP and KPNA4,
  based on IntAct analysis. F. The proteins binding to ZNF471, including MIS18A, COG7,
  PHF20L1, CARD14, BANP and HAUS1, identified in the Pathway Commons database. G.
  The interaction between ZNF471 and BANP, as determined through STRING database analysis.
  H-J. The correlation between the expression of ZNF471 and BANP, as determined by
  qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. K-L. ZNF471 could physically bind to BANP, as
  determined by a coimmunoprecipitation assay. (n.s: p>0.05, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001)'
