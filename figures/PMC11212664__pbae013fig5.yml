caption: 'Further blockade of the NLR signaling pathway attenuated unmitigated DSS-colitis
  severity in mice treated with TJ5 alone. (A) Colon samples were collected after
  7 days of DSS administration. Protein extracted from colon tissue was analyzed by
  western blotting for MyD88, NOD1/2, extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK),
  phospho-ERK, p38 MAPK, and phospho-p38 MAPK. (B) DAI change, (C) colon length, and
  (D) histological score of mice in different groups. (E) Representative H&E staining
  of colon sections. (F) Relative mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α
  in colon tissue by RT-PCR. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01,
  ***Pp < 0.001, ns: not significant.'
article_title: Suppression of MyD88 disturbs gut microbiota and activates the NLR
  pathway and hence fails to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis.
