caption: Genomic alteration landscape according to EMP1 and the predictive value of
  EMP1 for immunotherapy response. (A) from the top to the bottom panels showing tumor
  mutation burden (TMB), the relative contribution of four mutational signatures,
  selected differentially mutated genes (> 5%) and broad-level copy number alterations
  (> 20%), and specific genes. The proportion of patients in each alteration is displayed
  in the right bar charts. (B) Volcano plot exhibiting the differentially enriched
  GO pathways between EMP1 high and low groups in merged-cohort. (C) Heatmap illustrating
  the GSVA score of macrophage-related pathways between EMP1 high and low groups.
  (D) Violin plot presents the levels of EMP1 between EMP1 high and low groups. (E)
  Stacked bar chart showing the proportion of immunotherapeutic response in different
  EMP1 groups. (F) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of EMP1 high group and EMP1 low
  group in IMvigor210 cohort. (G) The boxplot of the ten immune checkpoint levels
  in EMP1 high and low groups
