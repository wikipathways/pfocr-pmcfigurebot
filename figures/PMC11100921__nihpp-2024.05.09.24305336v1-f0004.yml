figure_title: B-cell signaling and NFκB signaling signatures are associated with response
  to MUC1 vaccination
caption: (A,B) Heatmaps showing enrichment of B-Cell Receptor Signaling pathways in
  the PBMCs from Responders (R) vs. non-responders (NR) at Baseline (A) and high responders
  (HR) vs. non-responders (NR) at Baseline (B). (C,D) Differential gene expression
  from the CD40 Signaling pathway from PBMCs from R vs. NR at Baseline (C) and Week
  2 (D). Heat maps are organized as in Figure 1. (E) Violin plots showing expression
  levels of CD40 and HLA-DR on B-cells (CD19+). (F) Violin plots of NFκB complex p65
  subunit phosphorylation in T-cells (CD3+), non-DC/non-B antigen presenting cells
  (CD11C-HLADR+), and B-cells (CD19+). For violin plots, geometric mean fluorescence
  intensity (MFI) is shown on the y-axis
