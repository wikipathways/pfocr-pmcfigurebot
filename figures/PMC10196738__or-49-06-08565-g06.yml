  syngeneic mice.
caption: 'MAPK and Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression levels in a CT26 tumor in BALB/cKorl
  syngeneic mice. (A) MAPK signaling pathway analysis. After collecting the CT26 tumor,
  the protein expression levels of the phosphorylated form and unphosphorylated forms
  of the key members proteins were analyzed using specific antibodies and densitometry.
  (B) Bax/Bcl-2 pathway analysis. After collecting the CT26 tumors, the protein expression
  levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Cas-3 and Cleaved Cas-3 were assessed using specific antibodies
  and densitometry. The tissue homogenates were prepared from two to three tumors
  per group and western blot was analyzed twice for each sample. The level of each
  protein was normalized to β-actin. The data was presented as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05
  vs. Vehicle group. #P<0.05 vs. Cis group. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases;
  p, phosphorylated; AEC, aqueous extract of Ecklonia cava; Cis, cisplatin; Lo, low
  concentration; Mi, middle concentration; Hi, high concentration'
