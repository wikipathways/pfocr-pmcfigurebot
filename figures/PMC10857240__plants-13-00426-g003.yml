caption: Red/green frameless arrows represent a promoting/inhibitory effect, while
  red/green framed arrows represent an increase/decrease in substances. Substances
  surrounded with a dashed outline are in a free state. Compared to green varieties,
  chlorotic varieties are hindered in chlorophyll synthesis and degradation under
  strong light or low-temperature conditions, resulting in imbalanced carbon (C) and
  nitrogen (N) metabolism and reduced flavonoid content in the chlorotic leaves. Excess
  free nitrogen promotes the accumulation of free amino acids in chlorotic leaves.
  On the other hand, the loss of chloroplast structure and degradation of photosynthetic-chain-related
  proteins further increase the content of free amino acids in chlorotic leaves. In
  addition, the synthesis of fatty acids has also increased in chlorotic varieties.
  In purple varieties, low temperature or strong light enhances the expression of
  flavonoid-pathway-related genes, promoting the synthesis of more anthocyanins
