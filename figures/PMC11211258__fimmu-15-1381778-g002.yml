caption: Mechanisms of pyroptosis in modulating tumor immunity and immunotherapy.
  This diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the various pathways leading to
  pyroptosis and their intricate connections with immune cell functions and tumor
  immunotherapy. The canonical inflammasome pathway is initiated by pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), leading
  to the assembly of the inflammasome complex and activation of caspase-1. Subsequently,
  caspase-1 facilitates the maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, promoting
  inflammation. The non-canonical inflammasome pathway, triggered by LPS recognition
  through TLR4 and GBPs, activates caspase-4/5/11, which directly cleaves GSDMD, contributing
  to the lytic form of cell death known as pyroptosis. Caspase-3/8 mediated pathway
  illustrates the role of external triggers such as TNF-α, antibiotics, and chemotherapy
  in activating caspase-8, which then cleaves GSDMD or GSDMC, leading to pyroptosis
  and the release of IL-1α. Granzyme-mediated pathway depicts how cytotoxic cells,
  such as CTLs and NK cells, release granzymes that cut GSDME and GSDMB, inducing
  pyroptosis in target cells. The figure also highlights the release of immune cell
  attractants and the promotion of adaptive immune responses through antigen presentation,
  leading to the recruitment of primary and memory T cells. This process creates a
  feedback loop, enhancing the anti-tumor immune response and potentially synergizing
  with immunotherapeutic strategies such as CAR-T and checkpoint blockade therapies.
  The interconnected pathways underscore the complex role of pyroptosis in shaping
  the tumor microenvironment, influencing tumor regression, and informing the development
  of novel cancer treatment strategies.
