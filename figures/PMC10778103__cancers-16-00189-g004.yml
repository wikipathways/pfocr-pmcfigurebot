figure_title: Peposertib in combination with doxorubicin activates p53 signaling and
  suppresses DNA repair.
caption: Peposertib in combination with doxorubicin activates p53 signaling and suppresses
  DNA repair. SYO-1 (A) and HS-SY-II (B) cells were exposed to doxorubicin, 1 Î¼M peposertib
  or their combination for a period of 24 h. Protein lysates were analyzed by Western
  blotting using antibodies against phospho-Chk2 (T68), phospho-p53 (S15), p21, phospho-H2Ax
  (S139), and actin (loading control). Induction of p53 signaling pathway and accumulation
  of DNA-damage is observed in the combination groups with higher doxorubicin dose
  for both cell lines. The uncropped blots are shown in Figure S5
