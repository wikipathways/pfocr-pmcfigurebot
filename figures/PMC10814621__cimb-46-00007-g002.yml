caption: A schematic diagram presenting the mechanism of hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA)
  towards salt-induced oxidative damage. Under salt stress, sodium chloride (NaCl)
  enters the plant cell, where once inside, it (1) induces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
  accumulation. If not controlled, NaCl-induced H2O2 accumulation results in (2) peroxidation
  of the plant cell membrane, leading to extreme damage and even cell death. However,
  multiple studies have documented that HCAA is a response to salt stress. (Aâ€“D) The
  mechanism of HCA in reducing salt-induced oxidative damage in plant cells. (A) The
  salt-induced accumulation of H2O2 has been shown to increase the production of HCAs.
  (B) These HCAs then reduce cell membrane peroxidation, by donating an electron to
  H2O2, reducing the H2O2-induced lipid peroxidation of the cell membranes. (C,D)
  HCAs have likewise been documented to possess other antioxidant activities that
  reduce the occurrence of other types of oxidative stress damage, such reduced salt
  stress-induced protein degradation and DNA damage. Red arrows illustrate the salt-induced
  oxidative damage pathway and green arrows illustrate the HCA-induced alleviation
  of salt-induced H2O2 accumulation damage
