figure_title: Pathways associated with the signaling of BCSCs.
caption: 'Pathways associated with the signaling of BCSCs. Canonical activation of
  Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is initiated by the binding of the Hh ligand to PTCH1, which
  exits the primary cilium (PC), relieving SMO’s inhibition and resulting in SMO’s
  translocation into the PC. In the lack of HH ligands, PTCH1 inhibits SMO by disturbing
  its entry into the PC. GLI2 and GLI3 are sequestered in the cytoplasm by SUFU and
  phosphorylated by PKA, CK1, and GSK3β. GLI1 is fully degraded, while GLI3 and GLI2
  undergo fragmentary proteasome degradation. This leads to the creation of GLI3/2R,
  which moves into the nucleus, resulting in the inhibition of the GLI target gene
  transcription. GLI2 and GLI3 processing is disturbed by active SMO, which initiates
  their dissociation from SUFU, and translocation of full-length, active GLI (GLIACT)
  into the nucleus, resulting in the activation of GLI target gene transcription.
  Cadherins modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The level of free β-catenin in the cytoplasm
  directly affects the degree of β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus. Free β-catenin
  has a short half-life due to its phosphorylation by GSK3 and destruction upon binding
  to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Axin proteins. GSK3 activity is reduced
  by disheveled (DSH) when the Wnt growth factor binds to its surface receptor Frizzled
  (FZD). Notch signaling DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-1) ligands binding changes the conformation
  of the Notch receptor. The ADAM family arbitrates the first cleavage, which leads
  to the separation of the extracellular domain. A second cleavage then occurs inside
  the transmembrane domain and is catalyzed by the γ-secretase complex, which releases
  NICD for translocation to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NICD binds to the DNA-binding
  protein RBP-J, leading to Notch target genes’ transcription. CSL is a DNA-binding
  protein that recruits NICD to Notch target gene promoters. Schematic presentation
  of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway: Ligands bind to the receptor tyrosine kinases
  like Her2, which leads to conformational changes and activates PI3K. PI3K initiates
  activation of Akt by phosphorylation, which acts as a major activation source to
  further downstream signaling moieties involved in various cellular processes (mTOR)'
