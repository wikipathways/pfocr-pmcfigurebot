caption: The ASFV-induced necroptosis signaling depends on the TLR-TRIF pathway in
  PAMs and BMDMs. PAMs (A, B) or BMDMs (C, D) were infected with ASFV at 1.0 MOI for
  24 h to induce necroptosis, while cells without treatment (MOCK) were used as the
  negative control. PAMs (A, B) and BMDMs (C, D) were pretreated with IFN-β (1,000
  U/ml) for 8 h to induce the expression of RIPK3 and then were treated with LPS (100
  ng/ml) plus Z-VAD-FMK (50 μM) for 24 h to activate the TLR4-TRIF pathway-dependent
  necroptosis as the positive control. During infecting with ASFV or treatment with
  LPS plus Z-VAD-FMK, cells were treated with GSK'872 (1 μM) or GW806742X (1 nM) to
  inhibit the necroptosis signaling. TFA (the interaction inhibitor between TLR and
  TRIF) (40 μM) inhibited the necroptosis signaling dependent on the TLR-TRIF pathway.
  (A, C) The protein expression and protein phosphorylation level of RIPK3 and MLKL
  in cell lysates (Lys) were examined by western blot. (B, D) The relative LDH release
  in the supernatants was determined by cytotoxicity assay. Data shown are means ±
  SD. Statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t-test. **p < 0.01; ***p
  < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.
