figure_title: Regulation of tau protein kinase activity in the cerebellum.
caption: Regulation of tau protein kinase activity in the cerebellum. GSEA of the
  Regulation of Tau Protein Kinase Activity pathway showed no enrichment in any of
  the cerebella as reported in figures (A–E). ES = enrichment score; NES = normalized
  enrichment score; FDR-q = false discovery rate q-value. Significance is determined
  by an FDR-q < 0.25
