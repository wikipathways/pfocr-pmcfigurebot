caption: Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is linked with multiple human metabolic diseases.
  A synopsis of pivotal gut microbiota composition and microbial metabolic attributes
  linked to human metabolic disorders, including obesity, T2DM, NAFLD, and CVD, reveals
  a pattern of association. Research has implicated certain bacterial species and
  their metabolic functionalities in the pathology of these metabolic diseases; however,
  findings have varied between research studies. A selection of microbial taxonomic
  and metabolic features, alongside the trends observed in human metabolic diseases,
  is presented. The description in the figure is not exhaustive of all the taxonomic
  or functional changes detected but rather reflects recurring alterations recognized
  in multiple investigations. The red downward arrow in the figure indicates a decrease,
  while the blue upward arrow signifies an increase. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TMA,
  trimethylamine; BCAA, branch-chain amino acid; AAA, aromatic amino acid; BA, bile
  acid. The red and blue arrows represent the relative abundance of gut microbiota
  or the microbial metabolic pathway decrease and increase in the metabolic diseases
  compared with the healthy individuals, respectively
