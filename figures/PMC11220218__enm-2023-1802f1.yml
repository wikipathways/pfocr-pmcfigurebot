caption: Metabolic reprogramming in thyroid cancer and therapeutic resistance. (A)
  Metabolic reprogramming of thyroid cancer is illustrated. Glucose import is increased
  by higher levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and GLUT3 in the cell membrane.
  Glycolysis is upregulated by the elevated expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and the
  rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). Increased lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH) convert pyruvate into lactate, which is exported to the tumor
  microenvironment via monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4). The final product of
  glycolysis, pyruvate, is converted into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in oxygen-enriched
  conditions, and enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria. Citrate,
  an intermediate of the TCA cycle, could be exported to the cytoplasm via mitochondrial
  citrate carrier (CIC) and used for fatty acid synthesis. During glycolysis, the
  shunt pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and serine synthesis
  pathway, are activated to produce ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate from PPP and serine and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  from the serine synthesis pathway. The serine synthesis pathway is closely connected
  to one-carbon metabolism by the serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) enzyme. The
  amino acid transporters, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and alanine-serine-cysteine
  transporter 2 (ASCT2), are upregulated in thyroid cancer cells. The imported glutamine
  enters the mitochondria via glutamate carrier 1 (GC1) and is hydrolyzed by glutaminase
  to yield glutamate, which is converted into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to enter the
  TCA cycle. (B) The pathologic signaling pathways and related metabolic reprogramming
  in thyroid cancer cells that induce resistance to therapies. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase;

  THF, tetrahydrofolate; meTHF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; EAA, essential amino
  acids; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; HIF-α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; ATC, anaplastic
