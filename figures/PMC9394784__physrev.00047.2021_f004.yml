caption: Neural pathways involved in temperature regulation during heat stress. Temperature
  regulation is mediated by primary somatosensory neurons located in the skin and
  viscera that transmit afferent information to the brain via the spinal cord. In
  rodents, dorsal horn neurons project to the dorsal part of the lateral parabrachial
  nucleus (LPBd) in the brainstem. These neurons, in turn, activate (+) neurons within
  the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) of the hypothalamus. Increased activity of warm-sensitive
  neurons within the MnPO results in greater inhibitory input (−) to the paraventricular
  hypothalamus (PVH) and medial preoptic area (MPA) that provide tonic excitatory
  input to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). Innocuous warming has also been shown
  to activate ventral lateral preoptic area (vLPO) neurons resulting in greater inhibitory
  input to the DMH. The greater inhibitory input directed to the DMH results in less
  excitatory drive to the raphe pallidus area (RPa) of the brainstem that normally
  sends an excitatory drive to preganglionic neurons controlling cutaneous vasoconstriction
  (VC) and thermogenesis. The inhibition of this pathway results in a passive increase
  in skin blood flow (SkBF) and a decrease in heat production. In contrast, the neural
  pathways mediating heat loss thermoeffector responses in humans remain largely unknown.
  Brain imaging studies have confirmed that the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus
  and a juxtafacial area of the brainstem are activated during heat stress and that
  their activity correlates with sweating. Importantly, temperature regulation during
  heat stress relies on the activation of specific heat loss thermoeffectors in humans,
  namely active cutaneous vasodilation (VD) and eccrine sweat production, rather than
  the withdrawal of cold-defense responses in rodents. It is therefore unclear how
  the neural pathways for heat-defense responses identified in rodents can be translated
  to humans. Image created with BioRender.com with permission.
