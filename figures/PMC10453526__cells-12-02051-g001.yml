caption: Schematic diagram showing key nuclei and pathways involved in addiction with
  strong participation of nAChRs. Nicotine binding to α7 and α4β2 nAChRs at the ventral
  tegmental area (VTA) promotes the initiation of addictive behavior by favoring the
  release of dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
