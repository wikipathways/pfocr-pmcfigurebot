caption: Integrated analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. (A) Pathways involved
  in differential genes and differential metabolites in CH72 and ZC17 were intersected
  by Venn diagrams. The top 10 pathways that were most significantly enriched in each
  of the differential genes and differential metabolites among the pathways that intersect
  CH72 (B) and ZC17 (C) are shown as bar graphs. There are two pathways labeled in
  red that are co-enriched in the four pathway enrichment bar graphs
