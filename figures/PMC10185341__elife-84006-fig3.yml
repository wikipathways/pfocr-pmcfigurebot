figure_title: Coordination sphere changes across the Mn2+ transport cycle of DraNramp
caption: (A) Structures of the orthosteric metal-binding site in six conformations
  reveal the differences in coordination geometry and illustrate that the bound Mn2+
  is more hydrated in the outward-open and inward-open states than the occluded state.
  In the occluded structure of metal-free WT DraNramp a density we have assigned as
  water replaces Mn2+. Y54 in TM1a progressively moves to open the inner vestibule
  in the transition from outward to inward open, shown by black curved arrows. (B)
  TM1 and TM6 from a superposition of the three Mn2+-bound structures in panel a illustrate
  the swing of the Y54 sidechain as sticks. The view is rotated 180° along the vertical
  axis from . (C) Initial Mn2+ uptake rates for DraNramp variants Y54A and Y54F at
  membrane potentials ranging from ΔΨ=0 to −120 mV (n=2–3; each data point is on the
  scatter plot and black bars are the mean values). The Mn2+ concentration was 750
  μM, and the pH was 7 on both sides of the membrane. Y54A nearly abolishes transport
  whereas Y54F has near-wildtype initial transport rates. Corresponding time traces
  are plotted in . (D) ITC measurements of G223W (left; one-site binding model with
  fixed n=1) and M230A (right; two-site sequential binding model) binding to Mn2+.
  One isotherm is shown of two measured, and the listed Kd values are the average
  ± SEM (see Appendix 1 for ITC analysis).
