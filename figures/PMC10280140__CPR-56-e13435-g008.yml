caption: Knockdown of p70 S6K reverses VIC phenotype through upregulation of autophagy
  and inhibition of cellular senescence while protecting against apoptosis. Canine
  aVICs were transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 (Mock), scramble control, human p70
  S6K siRNA, mouse p70 S6K siRNA with or without 10 ng/mL of TGF‐β1 or 5 μM of baflomycin‐A1
  (Baf‐A1). (A) Representative western blot of p70 S6K, phospho‐p70 S6K (p‐p70 S6K),
  p16INK4A, p21CIP1 and p53, VIC phenotype and ECM protein expression and quantification
  of the relative protein expression (n = 6). (B) Representative western blot of p70
  S6K, phospho‐p70 S6K (p‐p70 S6K), phospho‐IRS1 (p‐p70 IRS1), phospho‐AKT (p‐AKT),
  caspase‐3, cleaved caspase‐3 and quantification of the relative protein expression
  (n = 6) (C) Representative western blot of ATG7 and LC3‐II protein expression in
  qVICs treated with 5 μM baflomycin‐A1 with or without 10 ng/mL of TGF‐β1 and quantification
  of the relative protein expression (n = 6). (D) Representative confocal images of
  LC3‐II labelled autophagosomes (green) and quantitative analysis of the number of
  LC3‐II puncta, scale bar 20 μm (n = 98 cells/treatment). (E) Representative images
  of SA‐β‐gal (blue) staining and quantitative analysis of the percentage of SA‐β‐gal
  positive cells, scale bar 50 μm (n = 12 microscopic fields). (F) Quantitative RT‐PCR
  (left panel) for senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) cytokine expression
  in aVICs transfected with p70 S6K siRNA with or without TGF‐β induction (n = 6).
  Quantification of secreted TGF‐β1, IL‐6 and MMP‐9 (right panel) in collected supernatant
  from aVIC cultures (n = 6). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA followed
  by Tukey's range test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to control.
  ECM, extracellular matrix; VIC, valve interstitial cell.

  and secretory phenotype of valvular interstitial cells through the modulation of
  cellular senescence in a naturally occurring in vitro canine model of myxomatous
  mitral valve disease.
