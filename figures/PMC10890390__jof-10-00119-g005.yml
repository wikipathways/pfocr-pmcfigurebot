figure_title: Construction of the de novo biosynthetic pathway for ERD.
caption: Construction of the de novo biosynthetic pathway for ERD. (a) HPLC profile
  of N31. (b) Results of flask cultures of the N31 and N32 strains are shown. “+”
  means ThF3′H expressing one copy number and “++” means ThF3′H expressing two copies.
  Statistically significant differences between two data groups were determined using
  a two-tailed Student’s t-test (one-tailed; two-sample unequal variance; *** p <
  0.001). All data represent the mean of n = three biologically independent samples,
  and error bars show standard deviation
