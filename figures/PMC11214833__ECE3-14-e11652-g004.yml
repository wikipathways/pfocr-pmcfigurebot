caption: Proposed regulation of the UPR in Leucetta chagosensis through alternative
  dimerization of LchaXBP1 homologs. Detection of unfolded proteins activates the
  endoribonuclease activity of IRE‐1, resulting in splicing of XBP1 mRNA (U). Translation
  of spliced XBP1 mRNA (S) produces peptides that can form dimers. XBP1 homodimers
  bind to the CRE aureobox to activate pathways linked to the adaptive phase UPR.
  The XBP1 heterodimer is unable to bind to the cognate DNA sequence, which allows
  activation of apoptosis through the RIDD pathway. ERAD, ER‐associated protein degradation.
article_title: Gene networks governing the response of a calcareous sponge to future
  ocean conditions reveal lineage‐specific XBP1 regulation of the unfolded protein
  response.
