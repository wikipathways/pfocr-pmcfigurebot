caption: In this figure, PARPis and anti-VEGF/VEGFRi cooperate to induce HRD. The
  hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1) increases VEGF expression, which interacts with
  neuropilins (NRPs), and VEGF/NRP signaling promotes homologous recombination (HR)
  through the Hippo pathway transducers YAP/TAZ, which activate the RAD51 promoter
  via the transcription factor TEAD. In contrast, hypoxia inhibits RAD51 via transcriptional
  repressor E2F4/p130 or inhibits BRCA1 by epigenetic silencing, leading to impaired
  HR. Thus, hypoxia exhibits contradictory actions, inhibition, or activation of HR.
  In this context, anti-VEGF agents or VEGFR inhibitors (VEGFRis) suppress VEGF/NRP
  signaling, causing impaired HR, whereas PARPis inhibit BRCA1 and RAD51 expression
  via increased formation of the transcriptional repressor E2F4/p130, resulting in
  enhanced HRD. Thus, PARPis and anti-VEGF/VEGFRi can cooperate to elicit the HRD
  phenotype to achieve additive or synergistic effects.
