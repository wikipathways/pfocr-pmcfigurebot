caption: Effect of JAK-STAT signaling on the development of pulmonary hypertension.
  As a significant inflammatory pathway, JAK-STAT signaling is overactivated in PH,
  contributing to the pathogenesis of this disease. JAK families have four proteins
  comprising JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2, and human STAT families include seven subtypes,
  which are STAT1, 2, 3, 4, and 5A, 5B, and 6. The activators of JAK-STAT signaling
  in PH are composed of cytokines of the IL-6 family (IL-6 and IL-11), growth factors
  (PDGF, VEGF, and TGF-Î²), and vascular tone mediators (ET-1 and AngII). Once certain
  cytokines bind to the receptor on cell surface, JAK phosphorylates automatically
  at tyrosine residues, which in turn phosphorylates STAT and dimerizes with it. Subsequently,
  they enter the nucleus, bind to specific promoters, and transcribe genes correlated
  with cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Targeting JAK, STAT, and
  related cytokines and receptors, JAK-STAT signaling might be a promising therapy
  for the clinical application and treatment of PH
