caption: Roles of deubiquitinases (DUBs) in breast and prostatic cancer. The right
  panel describes the DUBs that related to the breast cancer. Breast cancer is linked
  to the ER signaling pathway, and the DUBs, such as UCHL1, USP1, USP7, USP11, and
  USP22 could regulate the ER signaling pathway and thus affect the cell cycle. Besides,
  DUBs such as BAP1, and USP14 act on KFL5 and AR respectively and play roles in proliferation.
  DUBs such as USP21 participate in cell death of the cancer cells. The left panel
  shows the prostatic cancer related DUBs. Prostatic cancer is linked to the AR signaling
  pathway. DUBs such as USP7, USP10, USP12, USP14, USP22, and USP26 stabilize the
  AR related proteins and affect various cellular events. In addition, DUBs such as
  USP7, USP14, USP16, USP19, USP22, and UCHL1 target on c-Myc and p53 that are related
  to the cell proliferation and cell death. Lastly, and DUBs such as OTUB1, and UCHL1
  regulate the EMT and thus affect the metastasis. Detailed mechanisms can be referred
  to the main text.
