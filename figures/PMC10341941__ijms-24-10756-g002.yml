caption: Inhibitory role of Dex in the intracellular signaling pathway in RA-FLSs.
  (a) Protein expression of Akt, Erk, and NF-κB (total and phosphorylated forms) in
  human RA-FLS cells with or without 10 ng/mL TNF-α and 100 ng/mL Dex. (b–d) Bars
  represent the mean ± SEM of p-Akt (b), p-Erk (c), and p-NF-κB (d) protein expression
  (n = 3, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). (e) Protein expression of Akt, Erk, and NF-κB
  (total and phosphorylated forms) in human RA-FLS cells with or without 50 ng/mL
  IL-6 and 100 ng/mL Dex. (f–h) Bars represent the mean ± SEM of p-Akt (f), p-Erk
  (g), and p-NF-κB (h) protein expression. (i) Protein expression of Akt, Erk, and
  NF-κB (total and phosphorylated forms) in human RA-FLS cells with or without 10
  ng/mL EGF and 100 ng/mL Dex. (j–l) Bars represent the mean ± SEM of p-Akt (j), p-Erk
  (k), and p-NF-κB (l) protein expression (n = 3, ** p < 0.01)
