figure_title: Cysteine deficiency leads to metabolic inefficiency by depleting CoA
caption: |-
  a, Structure of CoA and pathways of CoA production and degradation. The red cross depicts how Cys deficiency would inhibit CoA biosynthesis and subsequent pathways involving it. b-d, CoA levels in liver (b) and muscle (c) at day 2 and liver at Day 6 (d) from Cse Het and KO mice on a No Cys diet (n≥3 for all groups) e, Select metabolite levels from urine and liver represented as log2 fold change between KO No Cys and Het No Cys (n≥6 for urine, n=3 for liver), AA: amino acids; KB: ketone bodies. Metabolites have p-values of less than 0.05 in either urine or liver except for 3-Hydroxybutyrate (p-value=0.0891). f, Liver glycolysis intermediate accumulation in KO compared to Het mice at Day 2 on CR No Cys. Red indicates up in KO with p-value<0.05. Number in bracket denotes log2-fold change (n=3). g, O2 consumption by mice provided Galactose or Glucose as sole carbon source after feeding No Cys diet (n=4). The experimental strategy is shown on the left. h, Weight measurements of male Cse Het and KO mice on No Pantothenic acid (No B5) diet or No Pantothenic and No Cys diets (n=4). i,
  Vnn1 mRNA expression levels in muscle and epidydimal tissue from bulk RNA-seq data (as shown in Fig. 3a). j, Urine pantothenic acid levels in Cse Het and KO mice on CR No Cys diet at Day 2. k, Summary of expected levels of various cysteine-containing metabolites under different conditions l, Weight measurements of male Cse KO mice after 7 days on a No Cys diet followed by 7 days on either a control diet or a No B5 diet (n=5) m, Liver and n, Muscle CoA levels in mice on Day 14 of the experiment shown in l. o, Model summary of the effect of cysteine deficiency on metabolic pathways and weight loss
