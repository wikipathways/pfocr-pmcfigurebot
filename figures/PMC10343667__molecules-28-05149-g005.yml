figure_title: TQFL12 toxicity resistance through the AMPKα signaling pathway.
caption: TQFL12 toxicity resistance through the AMPKα signaling pathway. (A,B) TQFL12-treated
  group shows up-regulated expression of both total and phosphorylated levels of AMPKα
  in the kidney tissues and the increase was more than that of the TQ group. (C,D)
  TQFL12-treated group shows up-regulated expression of phosphorylated levels of mTOR
  and the total expression of that in the liver tissues and the increase in the TQ
  group was more than that of TQFL12. (B,D) The quantitative data from (A,C), respectively.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. The fresh tissues (about 50 mg were obtained from mice,
  three representative samples were selected from the TQFL12 group and two from the
  TQ group) from each group were lysed by EBC buffer for 30 min at 4 °C, taken as
  homogenate, and high-speed centrifugated at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C; then,
  the liquid supernatant proteins samples were extracted and 2× SDS buffer were added
  and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. The protein samples were separated in 8% and 10%
  sodium dodecyl sulfate–PAGE gel, transferred to the polyvinylidene fluoride with
  300 mA for 2 h, and the membranes with the methanol were rinsed by TBST. After blocking
  in 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were incubated with indicated antibodies for Western
  blotting
