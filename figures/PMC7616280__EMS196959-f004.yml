caption: Inhibition, growth, respiration. Several essential cofactors have O2-inhibited
  and O2-dependent biosynthetic pathways. The anaerobic pathways are older, obviously,
  because the cofactors shown are essential to various groups of prokaryotic anaerobes
  that existed prior to the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. For references to the
  pathways see text. O2-inhibited pathways preclude colonization of oxic niches (“do
  not enter” signs). Auxotrophy for the cofactor in an oxic niche is only an option
  if another group in the oxic niche has already evolved an O2-tolerant biosynthetic
  route, in which case gene acquisition via LGT becomes an alternative to auxotrophy.
  The geological time of origin of oxygen respiration is not an issue here, only the
  relative timing of cofactor biosynthesis, which enables growth in an oxic environment,
  followed by origin or acquisition of O2 respiratory terminal oxidases
