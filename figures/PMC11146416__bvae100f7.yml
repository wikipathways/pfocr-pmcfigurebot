caption: An eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-enriched diet and Gɑz loss significantly reduce
  islet expression of key enzymes in the PGE2 production and signaling pathway. A
  and B, Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of NOD islet complementary
  DNA samples using primers detecting A, mouse prostaglandin E synthase (Ptges) or
  B, prostaglandin EP3 receptor (EP3). N = 3 mice/group. In both panels the mean ±
  SD is indicated, and data were compared by 2-way analysis of variance with Holm-Sidak
  test post hoc to correct for multiple comparisons. If a comparison is not shown,
  it was not statistically significant.
