  signaling pathway of D2R that accompanies nuclear entry of arrestin3.
caption: Importin is involved in ERK activation mediated via arrestin-dependent signaling
  pathway of D2R that accompanies nuclear entry of arrestin3. (A) Con-KD or importin
  β1-KD (Impo-KD) HEK-293 cells were transfected with the cDNA of D2G or D2Arr. Cells
  were treated with 1 μM DA for 5 min, and ERK assay was conducted. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001
  compared to the corresponding vehicle-treated groups (n=3). Cell lysates from Con-KD
  and importin β1-KD cells were immunoblotted with antibodies against importin β1
  and actin. The knockdown efficiency of importin β1 was about 85%. (B) Con-KD and
  importin β1-KD HEK-293 cells were transfected with the cDNAs of D2Arr and FLAG-arrestin3.
  Cells were treated with 1 μM DA for 5 min, and the cell lysates were fractionated.
  Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were immunoblotted with antibodies against FLAG,
  lamin b1, and β-actin. **p<0.01 compared to corresponding vehicle-treated cells
