figure_title: Bevacizumab induces the necroptosis of CC cells and activates the JAK2-STAT3
  signaling pathway.
caption: 'Bevacizumab induces the necroptosis of CC cells and activates the JAK2-STAT3
  signaling pathway. (A) Wound healing assays accessed the differences in the migration
  ability of SiHa cells between the normal control group and the Bevacizumab group.
  Scale bar, 100 µm. “NC” means normal control, “Bevacizumab” means treated with bevacizumab
  (10 µg/ml). (B-D) RT-qPCR results indicated an elevated level of RIPK1 (B), RIPK3
  (C) and MLKL (D) respectively in the Bevacizumab (10 µg/ml) group. (E) Result of
  the WB assay indicated an increased protein level of RIPK1, RIPK3, p-RIPK3, MLKL
  and p-MLKL with the treatment of bevacizumab. (F) Result of WB showed an increased
  protein level of STAT3, p-STAT3 and a decreased protein level of VEGFA with the
  treatment of bevacizumab. (G) WB assay demonstrated the inhibition of VEGFA by bevacizumab
  (10 µg/ml) was eliminated by necroptosis inducer. (H, I) RT-qPCR showed the up-regulation
  of JAK2 (H) and STAT3 (I) by bevacizumab (10 µg/ml) was eliminated by the necroptosis
  inhibitor NSA or NEC-1 (p-Value: **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01). J
  WB indicated an up-regulation protein level of JAK2, STAT3 and p-STAT3 by bevacizumab
  (10 µg/ml) was eliminated by the necroptosis inhibitor NSA or NEC-1, bevacizumab
  and necroptosis inhibitor showed synergistic effect in the inhibition of VEGFA'
