  and Hippo-YAP pathways.
caption: Multiscale network mechanisms and effects of Procyanidin B2 on AMPK and Hippo-YAP
  pathways. (A) Key mechanisms of procyanidin B2 on NAFLD with oxidative stress based
  on diffusion profiles in the multiscale network. Circle edges indicate targets related
  to liver injury. Blue colors indicate proteins related to the AMPK signaling pathways.
  (B) Immunoblotting analysis of HepG2 cell lysates for SREBP-1c protein. HepG2 cells
  were pre-treated with Procyanidin B2at concentrations of 1, 3, and 10 μM for 1 h
  and then incubated with T090 (10 μM) for 12 h. (C) Immunoblotting analysis of key
  proteins in the AMPK pathway and Hippo-YAP pathway. HepG2 cells were cultured in
  serum-free media for 12 h, followed by treatment with 10 μM of Procyanidin B2 for
  the indicated time period. (D) Immunoblotting analysis of the expression HO-1 by
  Procyanidin B2. HepG2 cells were treated with 10 μM Procyanidin B2 for 3, 6, and
  12 h. PCB2; procyanidin B2
