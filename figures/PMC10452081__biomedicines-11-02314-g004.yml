caption: 'Differential gene expression, KEGG enrichment analysis, and molecular docking.
  (A) Heatmap exhibits the differentially expressed genes in TCGA’s database. (B)
  KEGG enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that Rap1
  signaling pathway was significantly enriched. (C,D) Molecular docking suggested
  that ZYX and Rap1 can interact with each other. (E) Co-localization of ZYX and Rap1
  in 143B and U2OS cells. Scale bar: 20 μm. All data are from three independent experiments
  and are shown as mean ± SD'
