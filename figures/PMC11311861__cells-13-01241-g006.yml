figure_title: NaBu increases the mRNA expression of genes involved in sulfated GAG
  (heparin and heparan sulfate) biosynthesis.
caption: NaBu increases the mRNA expression of genes involved in sulfated GAG (heparin
  and heparan sulfate) biosynthesis. (A) The metabolic pathway involved in the biosynthesis
  pathway of highly sulfated GAGs such as heparin and heparan sulfate. The 2S, 3S,
  and 6S, respectively, refer to 2-O, 3-O, and 6-O-sulfation, whilst NS refers to
  N-sulfated glucosamine. The enzymes that were included in our analysis are highlighted
  in red. (B) A total of 4 million HMC-1.2 cells were treated with 1 mM NaBu for 24,
  48, or 72 h followed by total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis using 1000 ng total
  RNA, and qRT-PCR using gene-specific primers. GapDH was used as an internal control
  to normalize the samples. The data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCT method. n = 4.
  A Student’s t-test was conducted to calculate the statistical significance (p <
  0.05 = *) relative to the mRNA expression in the PBS control of the corresponding
  time point. A similar trend in mRNA expression was obtained in an independent biological
  replicate
