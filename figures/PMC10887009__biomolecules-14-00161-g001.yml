caption: 'Methionine cycle. The first step of the methionine cycle is the conversion
  of methionine into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by methionine adenosyltransferase
  (MAT). SAM is converted into S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) after donating a methyl
  group for methylation reactions. This step is mediated by methyltransferases (MTs).
  SAH is then hydrolyzed by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) to generate
  homocysteine. Finally, homocysteine receives a methyl group from the folate cycle
  or betaine to become methionine; these reactions are mediated by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:
  homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT), respectively. The methionine cycle is interconnected with three important
  metabolic pathways by providing substrates. These pathways include the folate cycle,
  the transsulfuration pathway, the methionine salvage pathway, and polyamine synthesis,
  all of which support important cellular functions. Met: methionine; SAM: S-adenosyl
  methionine; MAT: Met adenosyltransferase; SAH: S-adenosylhomocysteine; MTs: methyltransferases;
  Hcy: homocysteine; DMG: dimethylglycine; BHMT: betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase;
  5-methyl-THF: 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; THF: tetrahydrofolate; MTR: methyltransferase'
