figure_title: The signaling pathway is affected by crocin in mice hearts (A) mRNA
  levels of TLR4, MYD88, and NF-κB, (B) MYD88 protein, and (C) miR-21 transcriptional
  levels in stress-induced mice hearts.
caption: 'The signaling pathway is affected by crocin in mice hearts (A) mRNA levels
  of TLR4, MYD88, and NF-κB, (B) MYD88 protein, and (C) miR-21 transcriptional levels
  in stress-induced mice hearts. The 2-ΔΔCt method was used to calculate the relative
  expression (fold change) between sample groups. GAPDH and U6 were used as internal
  controls, respectively, for mRNA and protein, as well as miR-21 normalization. Fold
  change is indicated as the mean (SD) of log (2). The data show mean values ± SD
  of at least three independent experiments. * p < 0.01, ** p < 0.001. NS: not significant'
