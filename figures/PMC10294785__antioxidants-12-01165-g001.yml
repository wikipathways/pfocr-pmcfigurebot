figure_title: Curcumin attenuates obesity and alters hepatic senescence-related gene
  expression in HFHSD-induced obese aged mice.
caption: Curcumin attenuates obesity and alters hepatic senescence-related gene expression
  in HFHSD-induced obese aged mice. (A) 15-week animal experimental design. (B) body
  weight (g) measured at baseline and after 15 weeks of diet (n = 7–9 per group) (**
  p < 0.01). (C) Heatmap of senescence genes’ RNA expression as measured using FPKM
  (FPKM > 1.5). The list of genes was combined from the Cellular Senescence Gene Ontology
  (GO:0090398; MGI) and the KEGG pathway (hsa04218). Only expressions of genes that
  show significant differences in the NCD-Cur group compared to the NCD group or in
  the HFHSD-Cur group compared to the HFHSD group are presented in the heatmap (p
  < 0.05). Red indicates a positive Z-Score and green indicates a negative Z-score.
  (D) Volcano plots showing the log2 fold-change gene expression and associated significance
  (−Log10P) for the NCD-Cur to NCD comparison (upper) and the HFHSD-Cur to HFHSD comparison
  (lower). NCD, normal control diet; HFHSD, high-fat high-sugar diet; Cur, curcumin
