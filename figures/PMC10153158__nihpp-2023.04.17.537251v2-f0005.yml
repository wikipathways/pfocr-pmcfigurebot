figure_title: Proteomics demonstrates down-regulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate
  metabolism in intestinal tissue
caption: (A) Principal component analysis of quantitative proteomics data generated
  from the intestinal tissue samples of mice treated with water versus metformin.
  (B) Volcano plot and (C) K-means clustering of differentially abundant proteins
  in the intestinal tissue samples from water versus metformin groups.(D) Pathway
  analysis using proteins that are significantly down-regulated in the intestinal
  tissue samples of metformin versus water group. (E) Significantly altered protein
  levels in the gluconeogenesis pathway as well as key hexose transporters and fructolytic
  enzymes. Analysis performed in R using data generated from Proteome Discoverer
