figure_title: Progesterone activated BCL2 and XIAP signaling pathways.
caption: 'Progesterone activated BCL2 and XIAP signaling pathways. After adding progesterone,
  protein levels of BCL2 and XIAP were decreased. FE25, FE25-lenti-ctrl, FE25-PRA,
  and FE25-PRB were treated with progesterone 100 Î¼M for 24 h, and a western blot
  was performed. BCL2, B cell lymphoma 2; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; PRA:
  progesterone receptor A; PRB: progesterone receptor B. Representative of n=3. The
  number under each lane represented the relative quantitation of the expression in
  FE25'
