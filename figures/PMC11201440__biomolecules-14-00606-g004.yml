figure_title: Activated HRAS increases expression of fatty acid synthesis genes.
caption: Activated HRAS increases expression of fatty acid synthesis genes. (A) qPCR
  of key fatty acid synthesis mRNAs in Pparb/d wild-type and Pparb/d-null keratinocytes
  treated with GW0742 or HRAS infection. n = 3–5 independent biological replicates.
  (B) Representative quantitative Western blot analysis of key fatty acid synthesis
  genes in Pparb/d wild-type and Pparb/d-null keratinocytes treated with GW0742 or
  HRAS infection. n = 4 independent biological replicates. (C) Diagram showing de
  novo fatty acid synthesis pathway influenced in these studies. Values represent
  mean ± SD. Values with different letters are significantly different, p ≤ 0.05.
  * Significantly different than control, p ≤ 0.05
