figure_title: The 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:GFP zebrafish line produces quantifiable responses
  to small molecule modulators of the Wnt signaling pathway
caption: (A) Schematic of the Wnt/β-catenin GFP reporter the 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:dGFP
  transgenic zebrafish line. (B) A 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:dGFP zebrafish larvae at 48 h post-fertilization
  (hpf). GFP fluorescence is indicative of active Wnt signaling, and the caudal fin
  (dashed box) was used for quantification. (C) Representative caudal fin fluorescence
  in 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:dGFP larvae treated for 24 hr with DMSO, Wnt pathway inhibitor
  XAV939, or Wnt pathway activator BIO. Panels from left to right show brightfield
  images, GFP fluorescence, and standardized thresholding of fluorescence using ImageJ
  software. The percent increase or decrease in fluorescence compared to DMSO is indicated.
  Scale bars = 500 μm
