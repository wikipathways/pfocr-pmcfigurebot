caption: CD147 regulates IGFBP2 expression via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
  (A) Cell lysates of sh-CD147 and sh-Mock A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells were subjected
  to western blotting to detect p-AKT, p-mTOR and PTEN expression. Quantitation of
  (B) p-AKT, (C) p-mTOR and (D) PTEN expression was performed using ImageJ software.
  (E) Sh-Mock A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells were cultured with 50 μg/ml LY294002, a PI3K
  signaling pathway inhibitor, for 24 h. IGFBP2 and CD147 expression was detected
  by western blotting and (F) quantitative analysis of IGFBP2 expression was performed
  using ImageJ software. n=3 for each experiment. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. sh-Mock or
  0 μg/ml LY294002. AKT, protein kinase B; CD147, cluster of differentiation 147;
  m-TOR; p, phosphorylated; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and
  tensin homolog; sh, short hairpin RNA
