figure_title: Hippo and Hedgehog pathways mediated by identified ncRNAs.
caption: Hippo and Hedgehog pathways mediated by identified ncRNAs. The Hippo pathway
  is activated by TAO kinase, which subsequently phosphorylates mammalian Ste20-like
  kinase 1/2 (MST1/2). Phosphorylated MST1/2 then phosphorylates scaffold proteins
  SAV1 and MOB1A/B, facilitating the recruitment and phosphorylation of the large
  tumor suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2). Phosphorylated LATS1/2 facilitates the phosphorylation
  of transcriptional co-activators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional
  co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), leading to their cytoplasmic retention
  mediated by 14-3-3 and subsequent degradation. In the absence of Hippo pathway activation,
  the kinase cascades are not initiated, allowing YAP/TAZ co-activators to translocate
  into the nucleus and interact with the TEAD transcription factor family to modulate
  gene expression. In the absence of Hedgehog ligands, the twelve-pass transmembrane
  receptor Ptched (Ptch) is able to inhibit the activity of the seven-pass transmembrane
  receptor Smoothene (Smo). This inhibition of Smo leads to the inactivation of glioma-associated
  oncogene transcription factors (Glis) through the formation of a complex with suppressor
  of Fused (SuFu) and Kif7. This complex then promotes the phosphorylation of Glis
  by protein kinase (PKA), casein kinaseⅠɑ (CK1ɑ), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β
  (GSK3β), resulting in the repression of subsequent transcription. When the Hh protein
  binds to the Ptch receptor, it leads to a reduction in the inhibition of Smo, allowing
  for the phosphorylation of Smo by CK1 family kinase and GRK2. This phosphorylation
  event induces the release of Gli from the complex, enabling its translocation into
  the nucleus to regulate the expression of targeted genes. Additionally, the regulation
  of these pathways is influenced by ncRNAs, as depicted in this figure
