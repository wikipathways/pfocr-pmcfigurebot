caption: 'Canonical and aberrant BMP signaling and FOP. The canonical and aberrant
  activin A-mediated BMP signaling observed in FOP via mutant ALK2 receptors has been
  shown. Under physiological conditions, BMP or activin A ligands orchestrate the
  formation of a heterotetramaric receptor complex, comprising a homodimer of type
  II receptors in conjunction with a homodimer of type I receptors (e.g., ALK2 for
  BMP, ALK4/7 for activin A). This complex serves as a substrate for intramolecular
  phosphorylation events: the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor,
  thereby activating it. Upon activation, the type I receptor, in turn, phosphorylates
  intracellular SMAD proteins—specifically SMAD1/5/9(8)—in the context of BMP signaling
  and SMAD2/3 in the context of activin A signaling. This series of phosphorylation
  events, at the presence of SMAD4, culminates in the effective transduction of canonical
  BMP and TGF-β signaling pathways, respectively. The pathological landscape of FOP
  is characterized by aberrant activin A signaling, which anomalously cross-activates
  BMP signaling via mutated ALK2 receptors. This deviation from the canonical pathway
  represents a critical molecular mechanism underlying the pathological manifestations
  of FOP. This mutant ALK2 receptor also renders the overall signaling hyperactive
