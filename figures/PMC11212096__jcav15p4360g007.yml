caption: The correlations between MYBL2 gene and pathway score was analysed with Spearman.
  The abscissa represents the distribution of the gene expression, and the ordinate
  represents the distribution of the pathway score. (A)The correlations analysis between
  MYBL2 gene and DNA repair pathway. (B)The correlations analysis between MYBL2 gene
  and DNA replication pathway. (C) The correlations analysis between MYBL2 gene and
  tumor proliferation pathway. (D)The correlations analysis between MYBL2 gene and
  pyrimidine metabolism pathway. (E) The correlations analysis between MYBL2 gene
  and G2M checkpoint pathway. (F)The correlations analysis between MYBL2 gene and
  p53 pathway.
