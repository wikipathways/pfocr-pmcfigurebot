figure_title: Network pharmacology of SBT-P-derived isoflavone against breast cancer.
caption: Network pharmacology of SBT-P-derived isoflavone against breast cancer. (A)
  Venn diagram displaying shared targets between SBT-P isoflavone and breast cancer-associated
  genes. (B) Protein–protein interaction (PPI) of SBT-P isoflavone targets in breast
  cancer. (C–E) Annotation of gene ontology (GO) biological processes and molecular
  function for SBT-P isoflavone targets (false discovery rate or FDR < 0.90). (C)
  GO biological processes indicating that the major SBT-P compound is a “response
  to oxygen-containing compounds”. (D) GO molecular functions indicating that the
  SBT-P compounds primarily target kinase activity. (E) KEGG pathways indicating that
  the SBT-P compounds primarily target cancer pathways. From figures (C–E), it appears
  that the network pharmacology show the benefits of the SBT-P isoflavone compound
  which has activity in combating oxidants or free radicals along with fighting cancer
  through the kinase activity pathway
