caption: 'An increase in dsDNA in the cytosol can be the result of bacterial or viral
  infections. The entry of extracellular (ex.) DNA via endosomes results in the escape
  of partially digested DNA to the tightly controlled different DNAses, whose expression
  might vary from cell to cell. Bacteria might also activate the pathway by bypassing
  cGAS since cyclic dinucleotides produced by bacteria have been shown to bind to
  STING: cGAS (blue) is activated when cytosolic DNA is increased, and it synthetizes
  cGAMP. After binding cGAMP (red), STING dimerizes/multimerizes (green) and promotes
  the transcription of many cytokines belonging to the IFN type I family. The DNA-driven
  immune response is responsible for tumor immunity and plays a pivotal role in autoinflammation
  and autoimmunity. The cGAS/STING pathway can be modulated at different sites. Inhibition
  of the DNAses (1), the cGAMP transporters (shown using the example of SLC19A1) (2),
  or the cGAMP degrading enzymes ENPP1 (3) results in the increased activity of the
  pathway. Based on the current experience in drug discovery, it is unlikely that
  we will ever find low molecular weight compounds capable of stimulating at (1),
  (2), and (3); therefore, “inhibition” (violet-striped triangles) is to be considered
  the only therapeutic option. Using STING agonists (yellow triangle) (4) is the other
  option considered for activating the pathway. The activation of the cGAS/STING pathway
  has been shown to have a large potential for fighting tumors but might also be valuable
  in cases where a strong transient increase of the IFN response could help fight
  viral infection. Inhibition of the cGAS/STING pathway can be achieved with cGAS
  (5) or STING (4) specific inhibitors (red triangle). This intervention might be
  relevant for many autoinflammatory diseases that show an increase in IFN type I
  response. Evidence suggests that the cGAS/STING pathway controls autophagy and it
  has a role in apoptosis/necrosis. The relevance of these branches of the cGAS/STING
  pathway for their potential role in disease pathology is currently not well understood.'
