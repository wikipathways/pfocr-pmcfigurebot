figure_title: Impact of an active cGAS - STING pathway-mediated vs. SARS-CoV-2-induced
  type-I IFN activation on SARS-CoV-2 replication
caption: (A) Expression levels of ISGs Isg15, Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3 and Irf7 were assessed
  by RT-qPCR in uninfected polyclonal populations of SCC25 cells knocked out (KO)
  for cGAS and STING or transduced with a non-targeting (NT) control. Expression levels
  were normalized relative to NT control (set to 1). N=2–3 independent biological
  replicates, error bars show SEM. (B) Uninfected polyclonal populations of STING
  KO or NT SCC25 cells were subjected to immunostaining for IFIT3. IFIT3 label (in
  red) and nuclei (DAPI, in blue) observed under 4X objective by epifluorescence microscopy.
  Scale bars show 500 μM, (representative of n=2). (C) Relative expression of ISGs
  including Isg15, Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3 and Irf7 in SCC25 STING KO or NT control cells,
  uninfected or infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 2 i.u./cell. Cells were collected
  at 72 hpi and ISG expression analyzed by RT-qPCR. Data show the fold induction of
  ISGs in infected over uninfected cells from n=3 biological replicates, errors bars
  show the SEM. (D, E) SCC25 STING KO or NT control cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2
  at an MOI of 2 i.u./cell. Immunofluorescence detection for IFIT3 expression (in
  red) and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) viral protein (in green), and cellular nuclei
  (DAPI, in blue) at 72hpi from a representative experiment (n = 2) are shown. Images
  were collected with an epifluorescence microscope, 4X objective (D) or Zeiss LSM
  880 Airyscan confocal microscope equipped with a ×63/1.4 objective (E) as detailed
  in Methods. Scale bars = 250 μM (D) or 10 μM (E)
