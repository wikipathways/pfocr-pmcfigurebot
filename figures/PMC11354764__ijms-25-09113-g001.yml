figure_title: Insulin signaling pathway.
caption: 'Insulin signaling pathway. The two main reactions to insulin in the cells
  are the mitogenic pathway (A) and metabolic pathway (B). Arrow (blue or green):
  activation, Truncated arrow (blue or green): inhibition, Blue color box/arrow: mitogenic
  pathway, Green arrow: metabolic pathway, Light green box: induced cellular process,
  Red box: inhibited cellular process. See text for detailed explanation. Abbreviations
