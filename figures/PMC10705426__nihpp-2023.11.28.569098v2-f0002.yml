figure_title: Metabolic pathway analysis of cancer cell lines reveals cancer type-associated
  variations in the activity of pathways
caption: (A) Hierarchical clustering of relative activity scores for 73 significantly
  variable metabolic pathways across 41 cancer types. A metabolic pathway activity
  score < 1 for a cancer type represents reduced pathway activity in that cancer type
  in comparison with the average pathway activity across all cancer types; scores
  > 1 represent increased activity; and a score of 1 represents activity levels equivalent
  to the average over all cancer types. Pairs of pathway/cancer type with significant
  pathway activity (P â‰¤ 0.05) are highlighted with an asterisk (*). (B) Ranking of
  metabolic pathways based on the extent to which their heterogeneity is associated
  with cancer type, evaluated by computing the absolute sum of PCA loadings for each
  pathway over the first eight principal components capturing >80% of overall variance
  in data. The top 5 and bottom 5 variable pathways are shown
