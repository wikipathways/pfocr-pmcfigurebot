figure_title: Comparative analysis of transcriptomic responses in mouse and human
  stroke
caption: (A) Heatmap showing number of significantly up- and downregulated genes per
  cell types in stroke vs intact (left), ibz vs intact (middle) and ibz vs stroke
  (right) tissue. (B) Venn diagram showing the overlap and unique differentially expressed
  genes from neural cells between stroke and ibz tissue (C) Bar plot showing the common
  and differential expressed genes in non-neural cells (right). (D-I) Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) of biological pathways that are enriched in stroke vs intact and
  ibz vs intact tissue for (D) GABA, (E) Glut, and GSEA from stroke vs intact tissue
  in (F) Imm, (G) Asc, (H) FB, and (I) Vasc. Each panel displays the normalized enrichment
  score (NES) for pathways that are overrepresented (positive NES) or underrepresented
  (negative NES) in the post-stroke environment compared to intact tissue
