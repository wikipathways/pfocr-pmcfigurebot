figure_title: Cell communication analysis between PT cells and macrophages in different
  kidney samples.
caption: Cell communication analysis between PT cells and macrophages in different
  kidney samples. (A) Dot plot of different cell communication pathways in 3 d kidney
  samples. (B) Dot plot of different cell communication pathways in 14 d kidney samples.
  The color of dots represents the possibility of the existence of the pathway, and
  the size of dots means that there are significant differences in the pathway based
  on the cell communication analysis. (C) The heatmap shows the importance of the
  APP-signaling pathway network in different cell clusters in UIRI 3 d kidney samples.
  (D) The heatmap shows the importance of the App-signaling pathway network in different
  cell clusters in the UIRI 14 d kidney sample. (E) An overview of the App–CD74 signaling
  pathway in PT cell–immune microenvironment interactions in UIRI 3 d kidney samples.
  (F) An overview of the App–CD74 signaling pathway in PT cell–immune microenvironment
  interactions in UIRI 14 d kidney samples. The arrow and edge color indicate direction.
  Edge thickness indicates the weighted interaction between cell clusters
