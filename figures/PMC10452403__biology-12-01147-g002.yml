figure_title: Effect of hypoxia on the expression of components and targets of the
  BMP signaling pathway in MSCs+BMP-9.
caption: Effect of hypoxia on the expression of components and targets of the BMP
  signaling pathway in MSCs+BMP-9. Protein expression of BMP-9 (A), and gene expression
  of Bmp-2 (B), Bmp-4 (C), Bmpr1a (D), Smad1 (E), Smad5 (F), Hey1 (G) and Runx2 (H)
  in MSCs+BMP-9 cultured under either control or hypoxia condition, on day 8. The
  data are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and the * indicates statistically
  significant differences (p ≤ 0.05)
