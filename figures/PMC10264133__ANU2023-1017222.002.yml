figure_title: Relative expression levels of amino acid response signaling pathway
  including the general control nondepressible 2 (GCN2), activating transcription
  factor 3 (ATF3), activating transcription factor 4a (ATF4a), and activating transcription
  factor 4b (ATF4b) in the liver of Plectropomus leopardus fed diets with various
