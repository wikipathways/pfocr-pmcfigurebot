figure_title: FAN inhibits ASFV replication by suppressing the ASFV−induced AKT/mTOR/NF−κB
  signaling pathway activation.
caption: FAN inhibits ASFV replication by suppressing the ASFV−induced AKT/mTOR/NF−κB
  signaling pathway activation. PAMs were exposed to different concentrations of FAN
  (A) or 5 μM RAPA (C) or 5 μM, BAY11−7082 (BAY), a specific NF−κB inhibitor (E).
  PAMs were infected with the ASFV (0.1 MOI) for 2 h, followed by treatments with
  FAN (B), RARP (D), or BAY (F). After 24 h treatment with FAN, the cells were harvested
  to assess the expression levels of the indicated proteins by Western blot. The supernatants
  and cells were analyzed for IL−1β and TNF−α mRNA levels (G,H) ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001, compared with the corresponding viral control
