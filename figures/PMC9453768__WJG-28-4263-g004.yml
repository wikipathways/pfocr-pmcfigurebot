caption: 'Normal vs low-fiber colonocyte bioenergetics. A: The normal vectorial bioenergetic
  flux beginning with soluble dietary fiber that is converted to short-chain fatty
  acids (i.e., butyrate) by bacteria in the colonic lumen. Butyrate is rapidly absorbed
  by colonic epithelial cells (colonocytes). Once inside the colonocyte, butyrate
  undergoes mitochondrial beta-oxidation to generate acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), which
  is processed by the Krebs cycle that produces NADH and FADH2. The high-energy electrons
  present in NADH and FADH2 are used to drive oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos) resulting
  in the biosynthesis of ATP, which fuels most of the cell’s energy needs; B: Low
  fiber intake decreases available butyrate needed for acetyl-CoA production. Under
  these energy-restricted conditions, glutamate is diverted into the Krebs cycle and
  away from the synthesis of glutathione (GSH). Diversion of glutamate into the Krebs
  cycle is called anapleurotic metabolism (red curved arrow) and is needed to replenish
  depleted Krebs cycle intermediary metabolites that would otherwise be supplied by
  dietary soluble fiber, which can no longer perform this role due to a low fiber
  diet. Since glutamate is needed for the synthesis of GSH, the sequestration of glutamate
  as a replacement energy source restricts the amount of glutathione the cell is able
  to synthesize. GSH is the principal reducing equivalent required to neutralize cellular
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Insufficient glutathione will cause cellular H2O2 to increase,
  which upon extracellular diffusion may initiate neutrophil chemotaxis into the colonic
  epithelium and de novo ulcerative colitis or disease relapse. Interruption of colonocyte
  bioenergetic flux anywhere along the pathway from the microbiome to acetyl CoA will
  increase colonocyte anapleurotic metabolism and cellular H2O2, which can lead to
  ulcerative colitis. H2O2: Hydrogen peroxide; CoA: Coenzyme A.'
