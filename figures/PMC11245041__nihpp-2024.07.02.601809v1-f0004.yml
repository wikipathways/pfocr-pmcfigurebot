figure_title: Visualization and validation of top 3 predicted paralogs from XGBoost
  classifier
caption: (A) Paralog pairs with the top 3 prediction scores are displayed in a scatter
  plot.(B) Mutation profile of top 3 paralog pairs RAPGEF1/RAPGEF2, SYK/ITK and CCT8/CCT3
  in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts.(C, D) SHAP profile for RAPGEF1/RAPGEF2
  (C) and SYK/ITK (D).(E, F) Bar chart of mean viability of Rapgef1/ Rapgef2 (E) and
  Itk/Syk (F) knock-out treated B16F10 melanoma cells following culture with or without
  OT-1 T cells. The p values come from two-sided heteroscedastic t tests.(G, H) Gene
  sets enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that patients with low expression of RAPGEF1/RAPGEF2
  (G) and SYK/ITK (H) were associated with downregulation of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling
  pathway. The GSEA was performed using the differential expression output between
  patients with low (<25%) expression of both paralog genes versus all remaining patients
