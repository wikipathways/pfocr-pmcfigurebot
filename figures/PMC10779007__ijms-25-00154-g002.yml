caption: 'Schematic illustration of simplified NF-κB pathways. (Left): Canonical pathway:
  Upon stimulation by various factors, like cytokines or pathogen-associated molecular
  pattern molecules (PAMPs), IKK complex will be activated, leading to the phosphorylation
  of IκBα and its subsequent degradation. This will free up the p65/p50 heterodimer,
  which will then translocate into the nucleus, bind to κB-binding site, and trigger
  the transcription of NF-κB dependent genes. (Right): Non-canonical pathway. Upon
  stimulation by various factors, like lymphotoxin (LT) β or B lymphocyte activating
  factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF), NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) will
  be activated, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of IKKα, and the subsequent
  processing of p100 (p52 precursor)/RelB into mature p52/RelB heterodimer. This p52/RelB
  heterodimer will then translocate into the nucleus, bind to the κB-binding site,
  and trigger the transcription of NF-κB dependent genes. Symbol P: phosphorylation'
