caption: Scheme of a BMU and the mechanism of bone remodeling. Initially, the resting
  bone surface is covered by lining cells and pre-osteoblasts. Mononuclear cells secrete
  OPG, which suppresses osteoclastogenesis until the activation, resorption, reverse,
  formation and mineralization stages are activated. During the differentiation of
  osteoclasts and osteoblasts, different signaling pathways are activated that allow
  obtaining mature bone cells capable of performing specific functions. Osteoclastogenesis
  can be activated through the M-CSF signaling pathways, the RANK-RANKL pathway, and
  the ITAM RANKL pathway, while osteoclastogenesis is activated through the Hedgehog
  signaling pathway, the Notch pathway, the Wnt pathway, and the TGF-B pathway
