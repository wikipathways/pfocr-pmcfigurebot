caption: Analysis of pseudotime trajectories for clusters of CRC tumor cells. (A)
  Predicting the differentiation trajectory of subclusters of CRC tumor cells using
  Monocle. (B) Heatmap demonstrating Hallmark pathway scoring of CRC malignant cell
  subpopulations. (C) The genes that change with pseudotime have been classified into
  4 main categories, and the pathways in which each category is significantly enriched
  by metascape. (D) Scatterplot demonstrating the decrease in 5 metabolic pathway
  scores with elevated pseudotime.
