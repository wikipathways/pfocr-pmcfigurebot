caption: Exploring the Pareto front of the LGG-enterocyte interaction reveals a possible
  cross-feeding involving choline(A) We sampled the Pareto front of the interaction
  between LGG (blue) and the enterocyte (red). We inferred the correlations between
  transport reaction and ecosystem biomass to identify metabolic cross-feedings driving
  the interaction. Metabolites for which the exchanges are correlated with the ecosystem
  biomass, therefore driving the interaction, are described in boxplots by the distribution
  of their possible fluxes among the sampling. A metabolite is categorized as uptaken
  (or secreted) when its absorption (or excretion) by the relevant organism is associated
  with ecosystem biomass (see ). The color of the boxplot refers to the relevant organism
  (blue for LGG, red for the enterocyte). White boxplots refer to metabolites transported
  into the blood from the enterocyte. Metabolites involved in the metabolism depicted
  in (B) are in bold. (The box of a boxplot extend from quartile one to quartile three
  of the data. The median is marked by a line. The whiskers extend from the box to
  the farthest data point lying within 1.5x the inter-quartile range from the box).(B)
  Schematic representation of the predicted cross-feeding of choline. The arrows represent
  metabolic reactions. Dashed arrows represent the exchange reactions (i.e., the consumption
  of metabolites from the diet). Blue and red arrows illustrate the use of a metabolite
  for the objective of the LGG and the host, respectively. The metabolic pathway colored
  in green is the predicted cross-feeding of choline. All reactions pictured in this
  figure are obligatory (See ) in the most mutualistic solution of the Pareto front.See
