caption: Summary a targeted Smoothed inhibitor, SMOi (Vismodegib, GDC0449), damages
  IVDs homeostasis via inhibition of Ihh signaling in adult mice. (A) Inactive Ihh
  signaling occurs in the absence of Ihh ligand in which receptor Pitch1 represses
  SMO leading to the sequestration of Gli by SUFU (Suppressor of Fused). (B) Active
  Ihh signaling occurs in the presence of Ihh ligand in which Pitch1 relieves SMO.
  Activated SMO promotes disassociation of Gli from SUFU, resulting in the activation
  of Hh target genes. SMOi (Vismodegib, GDC-0449) bound to SMO and inhibiting their
  combination with Gli-SUFU complex, then disturbing the release of Gli into nucleus
  and activation of Hh target genes. (C) Normal structure of the IVDs in adult mice.
  IVDs are composed of well-organized annulus fibrosus, nucleus pulposus and cartilaginous
  endplate connects them to adjacent growth plate and bony vertebrae. (D) Systemic
  administration of SMOi in adult mice results in IDD-like defects characterized by
  CEP sclerosis, NP degradation and fissure formation within AF, as well as GP fusion
  and trabecular bone loss. (E) Blockade of Ihh signaling pathway promotes the apoptotic
  activity of IVDs chondrocytes, but that inhibits their proliferation and hypertrophic
  differentiation. These pathological changes in the growth plate lead a decrease
  in endochondral ossification. Additionally, Ihh signaling inhibition impair the
  volume of vertebral bone in mice at least in part via the inhibition of osteoblast
  differentiation and maturation.
