figure_title: ATF3 restricts ZIKV infection through regulation of components within
  the JAK/STAT antiviral response pathway.
caption: ATF3 restricts ZIKV infection through regulation of components within the
  JAK/STAT antiviral response pathway. A549 WT and ATF3 KO cells were mock- or ZIKVPR-infected
  (moi=10 PFU/cell) and co-treated with 30 nM of the JAK1/2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib
  for 24 hours at 37°C. Total RNA isolated from cells was used as a template for RT-qPCR
  analysis. (A) ZIKV, (B) IFIT1 and (C) MX1 RNA expression relative to ACTB were determined
  by 2−ΔΔCt RT-qPCR method. The experiments were repeated three times and the data
  shown are the mean ± SD of triplicate measurements. Statistical significance was
  determined by Student T-test. *p<0.05, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001, ns-not significant.
  (D) A representative Western bot showing the expression of ZIKV NS1, antiviral (STAT1,
  p-STAT1, IFIT1 and MX1) and ATF3 proteins. N=3
