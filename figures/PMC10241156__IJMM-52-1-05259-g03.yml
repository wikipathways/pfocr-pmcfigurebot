caption: G-Rg1 inhibits ERS and modulates the AMPK/mTOR and PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling
  pathways in ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells. (A) The expression of CHOP in ethanol-stimulated
  H9c2 cells treated with various concentrations of G-Rg1 was determined using immunofluorescence
  staining. The expression levels of (B) PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway-related
  proteins and (C) AMPK/mTOR pathway-related proteins in ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells
  treated with various concentrations of G-Rg1 were detected using western blot analysis.
  The results are expressed as the mean ± SD. The experiments were repeated three
  times. ***P<0.001. G-Rg1, ginsenoside Rg1; ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress; CHOP,
  C/EBP homologous protein; AMPK, adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PERK, protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase;
  ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 2α; EtOH, ethanol
