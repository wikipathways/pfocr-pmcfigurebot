caption: Dietary iron consists of Fe3+ and heme iron. Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by DCYTB
  and then transported to intestinal cells by DMT1, whereas heme iron is transported
  to intestinal cells by HCP-1 and degraded by HO1 to produce Fe2+ in intestinal cells.
  Ferrous iron is released into capillaries via FPN (a unique iron exporter), where
  it binds to transferrin (TF) through oxidation of HEPN or CP. Finally, iron participates
  in the iron cycle through the TF-TFR1 pathway or SLC39A14-mediated NTBI. Macrophages
  degrade aged red blood cells to recycle iron, which represents another important
  source of iron for the body. EPO released by the kidney activates the HIF signaling
  pathway to promote erythrocyte production. The liver also plays an important role
  in iron regulation. TF and hepcidin are secreted by the liver to regulate iron homeostasis
  and used by the liver and other tissues. In addition to hepcidin, RNF217 maintains
  iron homeostasis by promoting the degradation of FPN. CP ceruloplasmin, DCYTB duodenal
