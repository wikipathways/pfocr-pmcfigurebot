caption: Effect of light-emitting diode (LED) treatment on Claudin-1 and Nrf2/HO-1
  signaling pathway in ultraviolet (UV)B-irradiated skin of Skh:HR-1 hairless mice.
  The mice were exposed to LED light (630 nm) for 30 min twice daily for five days.
  All mice, except those in the control group, were irradiated with 200 mJ/cm2 UVB
  once a day for three days before sacrifice. Dorsal skin tissues were excised and
  homogenized. Total lysates of dorsal skin tissues were prepared and analyzed by
  Western blot using the indicated antibodies. The Western blot images are representative
  of three independent experiments. Quantitative analysis of the Western blot results.
  Protein expression was normalized to β that of-actin and presented relative to the
  control group. Each value represents the mean ± SD (n = 5). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001 significantly different from the control group
