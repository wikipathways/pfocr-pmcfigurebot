figure_title: GPR30 regulates PJA1 expression through the CREB signaling pathway in
  astrocytes
caption: '(A–D) Representative immunoblots and quantification of PJA1 (B), p-CREB
  (C), and CREB (D) in cultured primary astrocytes treated with G1 and G15. n = 6
  samples per group. (E and F) GPR30 activation increased cAMP levels in astrocytes
  in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. n = 3 samples per group. (G–J) Representative
  immunoblots and quantification of PJA1 (H), p-CREB (I), and CREB (J) in cultured
  astrocytes treated with G1 and H89. n = 6 samples per group. (K) Motif plot for
  CREB (http://jaspar.genereg.net/). (L) Bottom: The top 3 binding sites of CREB according
  to their predicted scores. Top: Primers designed to verify the binding of CREB.
  (M) The binding of CREB and IgG to the promoter region of Pja1 in astrocytes, as
  determined by ChIP. The experiment was repeated 3 times. Data are presented as mean
  ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s posthoc test
  (B–F, and H–J) or independent sample t test (M)'
