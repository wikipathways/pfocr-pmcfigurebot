figure_title: Piceatannol improved mitochondrial function of PC-12 cells by inhibiting
  autophagy via SIRT3 signaling pathway.
caption: Piceatannol improved mitochondrial function of PC-12 cells by inhibiting
  autophagy via SIRT3 signaling pathway. (A) PC-12 cells were preincubated with 0,
  5, 10 and 20 μM piceatannol for 24 h, followed by incubation with or without 250
  μM H2O2 for another 24 h. The protein expression level of SIRT3. (B) PC-12 cells
  were pretreated with piceatannol for 24 h, then treated with 3-TYP for 4 h and H2O2
  for another 24 h. The protein expression level of SIRT3 measured by Western blotting
  assay. (C) The cell viability detected by CCK8 assay. (D) The MDC/PI probe staining
  observed by flow cytometer. (E) The protein expression of LC3B II/I and ATG5 measured
  by Western blotting assay. The mitochondrial content (F) and mitochondrial ROS (G)
  observed by fluorescence microscope (Magnification, ×100; Scale bar = 100 μm). (H)
  Mitochondrial membrane potential measured by flow cytometer. (I) The protein expression
  level of PGC-1α, Complex IV and TFAM measured by Western blotting assay. The data
  for the experiments were represented as the means ± standard deviation (SD). Results
  marked with the same letters were not significantly different (p < 0.05)
