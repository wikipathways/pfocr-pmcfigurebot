caption: 'Scheme depicting the photoperiod-dependent flowering pathway, together with
  inputs from light receptors. Note that the components of the flowering pathway are
  mainly regulated through transcriptional activation or repression. SVP and FLM are
  components of the ambient-temperature, GA and autonomous pathways. GI acts in both
  CO-dependent (by suppressing CDF1) and CO-independent branches by either repressing
  SVP or by promoting miR172 expression to control flowering. Flowering itself is
  ultimately mediated by FT, which is an inducer of flowering. phyB acts to suppress
  CO protein activity, whereas phyA, cry1, and cry2 function to enhance the activity
  of CO. In parallel, phyB affects FT transcription by suppressing PFT1, an upstream
  activator of FT. Black arrows and T-ends indicate positive or negative regulation,
  respectively. Red arrows together with numbers indicate fold changes after drought
  stress. FLM and PHYB transcripts are subject to DAS and IS. Only the main regulatory
  genes are shown here. The complete flowering time network involves several hundred
  genes, and is available on the WikiPathways website (https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:
  WP2312). Modified after  and . DAS, differential alternative splicing; IS, isoform
  switching; temp., temperature; VLE, very low expressed.'
