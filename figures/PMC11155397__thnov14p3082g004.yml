caption: 'Exploration of potential molecular targets of AOS3 in ankle joint tissues
  of gouty arthritis model mice by means of RNA-Seq and the validations. (A&B) Volcano
  plots showing DEGs derived from comparisons between MSU+Veh vs. Control+Veh or AOS+Veh
  vs. MSU+Veh groups of mice. Red and blue dots show up- and down-regulated DEGs,
  respectively. Gray dots indicate non-DEGs. (C) Heat map with hierarchical clustered
  analysis showing the DEGs identified from panel A&B. (D&E) Bar charts showing the
  top 5 enriched pathways identified by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of up- or down-regulated
  DEGs derived from MSU+Veh vs. Control+Veh group. (F) Scattered plot showing the
  DEGs that were overlapped between MSU+Veh/ Control+Veh group and AOS+Veh vs. MSU+Veh
  group. (G) Bubble plots showing the top 5 significant pathways of the DEGs (colored
  in blue in panel F and outlined by black box) identified by KEGG. (H) Construction
  of PPI network of DEGs allocated to NOD-like receptor signaling pathway as in panel
  G (outlined by the red box). Deeper color and larger circle indicate more protein-protein
  interactions and vice versa. n=4 mice/group for RNA-Seq. (I&J) Representative immunoblots
  of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved IL1β, cleaved Caspase1 in Control+Veh, MSU+Veh and MSU+AOS
  groups of mice. β-actin was used as loading control. (K) Column charts showing the
  quantifications of NLRP3, cleaved IL-1β, ASC and cleaved Caspase1 protein levels
  in ankle joint tissues of three groups. n=6 mice/group. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 vs. Control+Veh
  group. #p<0.05, ##p<0.01 vs. MSU+Veh group. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey''s post
  hoc test was used in panel K'
