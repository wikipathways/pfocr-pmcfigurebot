figure_title: Comparison of gene expression related to milk fat synthesis following
  LEP_X1 and LEP_X2 overexpression.
caption: Comparison of gene expression related to milk fat synthesis following LEP_X1
  and LEP_X2 overexpression. The expression levels of LEP_X1 after overexpression
  of LEP_X2 (A), LEPR (B), genes in the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway (C), the mTOR
  signaling pathway (D), regulation of transcription (E), fatty acid synthesis and
  desaturation (F), and cellular TG concentration in lactating (G) and non-lactating
  (H). Data are presented as means Â± SEM for three individual cultures; * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
