caption: A proposed working model for illustrating the regulatory role of abscisic
  acid (ABA)-responsive TrMYB33-TrSAMS1 module in spermidine (Spd) accumulation under
  drought stress. Drought increases endogenous ABA, which subsequently starts the
  ABA signaling-transduction pathway by promoting the release and activation of TrMYB33.
  As a result, TrMYB33 consecutively positively regulates the expression of TrSAMS1
  by directly and specifically binding to the MYB binding sites and activating the
  promoter, bringing about upregulation of TrSAMS1, which is then joined into the
  metabolic pathway to promote Spd production. The “TAACCA” MYB binding site is shown
  in blue circle; mRNA of TrSAMS1 is shown as a green line; while the TrSAMS1 proteins
  are shown using the blue curved lines
