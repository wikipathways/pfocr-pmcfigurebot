caption: KLF13 associates in chromatin with promoters of some genes involved in the
  JAK/STAT signaling pathway in HT22 cells. (A). Genome traces from the Integrative
  Genome Viewer (IGV) were captured as screenshots to show the precise locations of
  KLF13 chromatin-streptavidin precipitation sequencing (ChSP-seq) peaks. The peaks
  were identified at genes in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway [10]. The gene structures
  are presented below in the genome traces, where black-filled bars and lines represent
  exons and introns, respectively. All peaks are located within the proximal promoter
  regions of the genes, and the gene orientations are 5’ to 3’. (B). To confirm the
  KLF13 ChSP-seq peaks associated with JAK/STAT signaling pathway genes, we conducted
  targeted ChIP-qPCR assays in HT22 cells. HT22-TR/TO-Klf13 cells were treated with
  either vehicle or doxycycline (dox; 1 μg/mL) for 16 h. After harvesting the cells,
  chromatin was isolated for ChIP assays. We used the Klf16 intron, which did not
  have KLF13 ChSP peaks, as a negative control region (Control). The KLF13 ChIP-qPCR
  data are expressed as a percentage of the input. All the loci examined showed enrichment
  after forced expression of Klf13 in the KLF13 ChIP-qPCR assay (Klf16, p = 0.0005;
  Jak1, p = 0.0394; Stat5b, p = 0.0258; Socs1, p = 0.0022; and Socs3, p = 0.0021;
  Student’s t-test. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences with
  p < 0.05). Bars represent the mean + SEM (n = 4/genotype)
