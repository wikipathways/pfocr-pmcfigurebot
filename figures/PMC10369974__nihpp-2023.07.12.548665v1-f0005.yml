caption: (A) Indicated strains are chromosomal replacements of murA and murD murAP122S,
  murAL35F and murDD447E respectively. Overnight cultures were plated on LB medium
  by spot- titering and incubated at 30°C overnight. (B) Overnight cultures of the
  indicated strains were subcultured 1:100 and grown at 37°C in LB medium for 1 hour,
  then backdiluted 1:100 in LB and incubated at 37°C for an additional 2 hours before
  imaging (C) The different MurA mutants were purified, and their activity was measured
  in vitro using a MurA assay kit which measures the inorganic phosphate released
  from the MurA enzymatic reaction. Statistical significance was determined by an
  ordinary one-way ANOVA, error bars represent the standard deviation of three replicates
