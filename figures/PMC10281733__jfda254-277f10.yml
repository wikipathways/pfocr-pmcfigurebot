figure_title: Schematic representation of LPS-antagonist potential of Q3G on pulmonary
  injury
caption: LPS induces lung inflammation, pyroptosis and apoptosis through TLR4-mediated
  NF-κB signaling pathway and ROS production, then leading to activation of NLRP3
  inflammasome and caspase cascade. Q3G functions against LPS via the inhibition of
  TLR4/NF-κB signaling, inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome and downregulation of mitochondrial
  apoptosis pathway that subsequently alleviates the pulmonary injury
