caption: Conjoint transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of SG biosynthetic pathways
  in stevia post-polyploidization. (A) Diagrammatic representation of genes and metabolites
  in the SG biosynthetic pathway responsive to polyploidization. Red and blue indicate
  upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively, and the value in parentheses
  indicates the number of genes. The polyploidization-upregulated SGs were placed
  in the lake blue boxes. (B) Expression pattern of genes related to SG biosynthetic
  pathway. DSL represents diploid stevia leaf and TSL for autotetraploid stevia leaf
