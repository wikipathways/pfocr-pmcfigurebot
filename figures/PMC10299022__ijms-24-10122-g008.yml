  Lut suppressed the activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway in 3D organoid culture. (A–C) Docking diagram of Lut with genes (JAK2, STAT3, and SOCS3) related to core pathway in KEGG of ALI. (D) Representative Western blot and corresponding graphical representation for p-STAT3/STAT3 of Control, NC (negative control), and siSTAT3 group in primary AT2 cells. * p < 0.05, compared with Control group, n = 4. Mann–Whitney U test was used to analyze the difference of the means for significance. (E) Representative Western blot and corresponding graphical representation for p-JAK2/JAK2, p-STAT3/STAT3, α/γ-EnaC, and SOCS3 in primary AT2 cells. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared with Control group. &
