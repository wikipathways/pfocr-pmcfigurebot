figure_title: 'Transcriptomic results. (A) Protocols by which the sperm were treated
  in transcriptomic analysis. (B) Volcano plot of the total altered genes. Upregulated
  genes are shown in blue, and downregulated genes are shown in red. (C) Top 20 upregulated
  and top 20 downregulated genes during the freezing-thawing process. (D) GO enrichment
  analysis of the top 30 regulated genes. GSEA indicated that the (E) oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway, (F) androgen response pathway and (G) spermatogenesis pathway were altered
  by cryopreservation. GO: gene ontology, GSEA: gene set enrichment analysis'
