caption: Akt1/2/3 was required for growth-promoting IGF-1 signaling in KPC cells.
  (A) Colony formation assay of parental KPC and Akt1/2/3KO cells cultured in the
  indicated conditions. A total of 10,000 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and
  treatment started on day 2 by replacing the media with either DMEM with PBS, DMEM
  containing 100 ng/mL EGF or 100 ng/mL IGF-1 or 100 ng/mL EGF plus 100 ng/mL IGF-1,
  or 10% FBS. The media were replaced every day and cells were stained with crystal
  violet on day 5. The quantification of the crystal-violet-positive area with Image
  J is shown on the right; a two-way ANOVA was performed followed by Šídák’s multiple
  comparisons test. *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.001. (B) Heatmap of all genes by RNA-seq
  of KPC and Akt1/2/3KO (n = 3). The experiment was conducted with triplicates of
  three different passages. The color scale for the z-score is shown on the right.
  (C) GSEA pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes between
  KPC and Akt1/2/3KO cell lines, and subsequent visualization by EnrichmentMap in
  Cytoscape showed a cluster of interconnected pathways related to cholesterol metabolism.
  (D) The transcript levels of key genes involved in the cholesterol synthesis pathway.
  t-tests were performed. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. Srebp2 is a
  master regulator of cholesterol metabolism. Hmgcs1 and Hmgcr encode the rate-limiting
  enzymes in the mevalonate pathway. Ldlr encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor,
  responsible for cholesterol uptake. (E) Protein-mass-normalized whole-cell cholesterol
  levels were measured by the Amplex Red assay of KPC and Akt1/2/3KO cells in the
  indicated conditions. Two-way ANOVA with uncorrected Fisher’s LSD test. ns not significant,
  ** p < 0.01.
