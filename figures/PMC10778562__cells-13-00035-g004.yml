figure_title: Gene expression profile of enriched gene pathways in Eprs1 cKO hearts.
caption: 'Gene expression profile of enriched gene pathways in Eprs1 cKO hearts. (A)
  Heat map showing gene expression in enriched pathways. (B) RT-qPCR quantification
  of a selected cohort of upregulated genes. Ctrl: aMHCMCM mice at 2 weeks post-tamoxifen
  injection. (C) RT-qPCR quantification of a selected cohort of downregulated genes.
  Ctrl: aMHCMCM mice at 2 weeks post-tamoxifen injection. Data are represented as
  mean ± SEM. Comparisons were performed by One-way ANOVA with Turkey’s post hoc multiple
  comparisons test for (B,C). NS, not significant; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p
  < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001'
