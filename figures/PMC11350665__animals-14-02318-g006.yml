figure_title: Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs and DEMs.
caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs and DEMs. (a) Bubble plot of KEGG enrichment
  for DEGs and DEMs. The x-axis represents the ratio of the number of enriched differential
  metabolites or genes annotated to metabolites or genes in the pathway to the total
  number in that pathway (ratio). The y-axis represents KEGG pathways jointly enriched
  in the metabolome and transcriptome. The count indicates the number of enriched
  metabolites or genes in the pathway. The colors represent p-values, with brighter
  colors indicating smaller p-values and more significant pathway enrichment. (b)
  iPath pathway map of shared enriched pathways. Colored boxes represent enriched
  pathways, nodes depict various biochemical molecules, lines represent biochemical
  reactions, and blue lines within the pathways indicate pathways jointly enriched
  with DEGs and DEMs
