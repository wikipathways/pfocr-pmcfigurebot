figure_title: Cholesterol metabolism is necessary to defend against foreign antigens.
caption: Cholesterol metabolism is necessary to defend against foreign antigens. Upon
  viral infection, including influenza or SARS-CoV, IFITM3 expression is upregulated
  through IFN receptor-mediated activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Subsequently,
  the accumulated IFITM3 proteins within endosomal membranes induce negative membrane
  curvature by inserting the amphipathic helix structure into the endosomal membrane.
  The amphipathic helix of IFITM3 directly interacts with cholesterol, increasing
  membrane rigidity. Consequently, the accumulation of cholesterol at the endosomal
  membrane restricts the release of viral particles into the cytosol, thus blocking
  viral infection. In B cells, activated BCR signaling induces the localization of
  IFITM3 at the lipid raft in the plasma membrane, where IFITM3 amplifies BCR-PI3K-AKT
  signaling upon encountering antigens. In response to the recognition of conserved
  patterns displayed in bacteria or viruses, activation of TLRs harboring cholesterol-binding
  motifs depends on the accumulation of cholesterol at the lipid raft. mTOR signaling
  downstream of active BCR promotes the nuclear accumulation of SREBP2. SREBP2 upregulates
  the levels of molecules involved in cholesterol synthesis, such as HMGCR, which,
  in turn, feed cholesterol forward to contributes to B cell activation against foreign
  antigens. Conversely, high cholesterol conditions block SREBP2 activation, and instead
  induces oxysterol-mediated activation of LXRs promoting the elimination of excess
  cholesterol via upregulation of cholesterol transporters such as ABCA1
