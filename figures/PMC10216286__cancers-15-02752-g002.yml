caption: Mechanisms of TRAIL resistance. TRAIL resistance mechanisms can occur at
  any point along the TRAIL signaling pathway. Overexpression of decoy receptors,
  such as DcR1, DcR2, and OPG, can inhibit TRAIL-induced activation of DR4 and DR5
  at the cell surface. TRAIL-induced apoptosis can also be inhibited by the inhibitory
  protein c-FLIP. This is accomplished by c-FLIP binding to FADD or procaspases 8/10
  and inhibiting DISC formation. Antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-XL) can
  inhibit the TRAIL signaling pathway. These proteins bind to pro-apoptotic proteins
  (e.g., BAX), preventing MOMP, SMAC/DIABLO, and cytochrome c release. Two more downstream
  TRAIL signaling inhibitors are XIAP and IAP. These proteins prevent caspase 9, as
  well as caspases 3, 6 and 7 activation, which in turn inhibits apoptosis
