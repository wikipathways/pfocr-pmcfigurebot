caption: Analysis of the induction of IRGs by DB addition to infected cells and the
  relevance of the IFN signaling pathway. (a) Representative immunoblot analysis of
  5 × 105 HFF incubated with increasing amounts of UV-inactivated DBs derived from
  the HCMV strain TR-∆GFP. Cell lysates were prepared one day after DB application
  and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses. Untreated cells (−) served as
  the control. The membranes were probed with antibodies against MX1, IFIT3 and ISG15.
  An antibody directed against the viral pp65 protein was used to confirm DB internalization.
  Tubulin served as the sample loading control. (b) HFFs were left uninfected, were
  infected with TB40/E (moi 0.5) or were pre-treated with 10 µg of UV-irradiated DBs
  for 2 h before infection with TB40/E (moi 0.5). IRG and viral pp65 and UL44 expression
  levels were measured up to 3 d.p.i by Western blotting. Tubulin was used as loading
  control. (c) Representative immunoblot analysis of MX1, IFIT3, and ISG15 expression
  in HFFs upon JAK inhibitor I treatment, compared to the untreated control cells.
  HFFs were incubated in 5% MEM medium in the presence or absence of JAK inhibitor
  I (20 μM/mL) for one hour. Afterwards, the cells were infected with the strain TB40/E
  or infected and simultaneously co-incubated with 10 µg of UV-irradiated DBs. Each
  sample was further co-treated with JAK inhibitor I for 24 h. Addition of IFN-β (100
  U/mL) was used to control the effects of the inhibitor on the JAK-STAT signaling
  cascade. Pp65 was used as a DB internalization control
