caption: Invertebrate innate immunity. PAMPs (pathogen-related molecular patterns)
  and DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) originating from the pathogen invasion
  are recognized by the PPRs (pattern recognition receptors) on innate immune cells.
  Recognition of pathogen antigens and pathogen phagocytosis activates the immune
  call and induces a cascade of signaling pathways, which affect protein expression
  at translational and transcriptional levels. Activated immune cells produce antimicrobial
  factors (AMFs), such as antimicrobial peptides, oxyradicals, and melanin, which
  destroy pathogens. The metabolic changes in the activated immune cell can also result
  in the epigenetic modifications of chromatin and chromosomes. The epigenetic modifications
  of the genome will result in the imprinting of pathogen-encounter memory and the
  formation of innate memory cells. When pathogen-encounter-induced epigenetic modifications
  occur in gametes (usually in the egg, but sometimes also in sperm) they are transmitted
  to the next generation(s) where they program the innate immune cells of the offspring
  for rapid and strong anti-pathogen responses
