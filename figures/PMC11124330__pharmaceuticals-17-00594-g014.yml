caption: 'VVC is treated by BEPD, which inhibits the activation of the TLR4 signaling
  pathway (Western blots). Western blots were utilized to detect the expression of
  TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB proteins. Values are presented as mean ± SD. n = 3. * p <
  0.05, vs. control group; ** p < 0.01, vs. control group; *** p < 0.001, vs. control
  group; # p < 0.05, vs. model group; ## p < 0.01, vs. model group; ### p < 0.001,
  vs. model group. BEPD, n-butanol extract of Pulsatilla decoction; BEPD-L, low-dose
  BEPD group (20 mL/kg); BEPD-M, medium-dose BEPD group (40 mL/kg); BEPD-H, high-dose
  BEPD group (80 mL/kg); VVC, vulvovaginal candidiasis; Flu, fluconazole group; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88; TLR, Toll-like receptor'
