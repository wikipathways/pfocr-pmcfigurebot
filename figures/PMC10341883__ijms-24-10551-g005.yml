figure_title: Biological consequences of ANG II binding on angiotensin II type I and
  II receptors.
caption: Biological consequences of ANG II binding on angiotensin II type I and II
  receptors. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is a bio-enzymatic cascade
  that contributes to various systematic and localized processes. The octapeptide
  angiotensin II (ANG II) is the biological effect of the RAAS and regulates blood
  pressure and extracellular volume. ANG II can bind two types of receptors that are
  involved in the regulation of renal hemodynamics and tubular function. These effects
  are dependent on binding to the two subtypes of receptors angiotensin receptors
  type I (AGTR1) and angiotensin receptors type II (AGTR2). ANGII binding and signaling
  through AGTR1 is associated with cell division, cytoskeleton disruption, vasoconstriction,
  metal ion transport, and regulation of hormone levels, e.g., estrogen or cholecystokinin.
  The development of orally active, non-peptide, selective AGTR1 blockers began with
  the synthesis of losartan. Preventing the binding of ANGII to AGTR1 leads to binding
  and signaling through AGTR2, which is associated with vasodilation, renin secretion,
  cell differentiation, extracellular matrix organization, and activation of the oxytocin
  signaling pathway [64]
