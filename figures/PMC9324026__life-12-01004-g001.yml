caption: From acetate via citrate cyclus to cholesterol as precursor of progesterone.
  Interestingly, progesterone is not only metabolized in the adrenal gland and sex
  organs but also in the kidney and liver. Focusing on progesterone synthesis, conversion
  from cholesterol to pregnenolone takes place in mitochondria through a P450-enzyme
  complex (hydroxylase/desmolase) which is induced through ACTH, linking the metabolite
  synthesis pathway with the HPA axis, implying that progesterone acts as a prohormone
  for androgens and oestrogens [,,].
