caption: 'The major pathways and interactions regulated by BACE1: (A) Notch signaling
  pathway, (B) Amyloidogenic pathway, and (C) NFκB pathway. In the Notch signaling
  pathway, the binding of Notch1 to the Jag1 ligand causes a conformational change
  in Notch1 and results in cleavage. This cleavage releases NCID, which then relocates
  into the nucleus. NCID’s relocation activates downstream signaling. This signaling
  can be regulated by binding Jag1 to the surface of the cell. BACE1 then cleaves
  Jag1, which regulates the activity of Jag1 in the sending cell and stimulates Notch1
  signaling in the receiving cell. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by
  BACE1 to generate amyloid-beta. The two cleavage fragments, C99 and sAPP-β, are
  released. The C99 complex with amyloid-beta is cleaved by γ -secretase, which generates
  AICD and releases amyloid-beta. The BACE1 cleavage is the rate-limiting step in
  amyloid-beta formation, therefore the liberation of amyloid-beta leads to an accumulation
  of amyloid-beta. In the NFκB pathway, GSK3B activates NFκB, which causes the phosphorylation
  of IκB. This phosphorylation causes IκB to relocate to the nucleus and bind to DNA.
  This activates multiple target genes associated with amyloid-beta production including
  BACE1, which can reactivate NFκB'
