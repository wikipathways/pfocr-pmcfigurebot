figure_title: CGA prevented NF-κB pathway activation induced by AFB1 in L-02 cells.
caption: 'CGA prevented NF-κB pathway activation induced by AFB1 in L-02 cells. (A)
  clustering analysis of inflammation-related genes. (B) GSEA plot of a significant
  gene set associated with NF-κB-mediated signaling (Control vs. AFB1). FDR, false
  discovery rate; NES, normalized enrichment score. (C) GSEA plot of a significant
  gene set associated with NF-κB-mediated signaling (AFB1 vs. CGA + AFB1). (D–F) relative
  mRNA expressions of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in L-02 cells. (G) KEGG pathway (AFB1
  vs. Control) enrichment. “NF-κB signaling pathway” is shown with shadow red. (H)
  KEGG pathway (CGA + AFB1 vs. AFB1) enrichment. “NF-κB signaling pathway” is shown
  with shadow red. (I–L) Western blots and quantification of RelB, TRAF2, and p52.
  Note: No shoulder marker or same shoulder marker in the same row means the difference
  is not significant (p > 0.05), different shoulder markers mean the difference between
  groups was significant (p ≤ 0.05)'
