caption: Anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect of betahistine after vestibular
  lesion. The vestibular lesion induces an inflammatory context in the deafferented
  vestibular nuclei (VN). Betahistine inhibits the histamine H3 receptor (H3R), which
  leads to the activation of a cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway that induces glial-mediated
  inhibition of inflammation. These elements lead to a neuroprotective environment
  and would explain the decrease of neuronal differentiation in deafferented VN under
  this treatment. Created with bioRender
