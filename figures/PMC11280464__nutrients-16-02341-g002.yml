figure_title: Top 20 differential metabolic pathways for differential metabolites
  in the hydrogen group.
caption: Top 20 differential metabolic pathways for differential metabolites in the
  hydrogen group. RichFactor represents the ratio of the number of differential metabolites
  in a metabolic pathway to the total number of metabolites identified in that pathway,
  a higher value indicates a higher degree of enrichment of differential metabolites
  within the pathway; the y-axis represents the differential metabolic pathways, such
  as choline metabolism in cancer, which suggests that hydrogen-rich gas, compared
  to air, can promote the choline metabolic pathway in cancer; Number, the size of
  the dot represents the number of differential metabolites in the corresponding pathway,
  a larger dot indicates a greater number of differential metabolites within that
  pathway; p-value, represents the p-value from the hypergeometric test, a smaller
  p-value indicates greater reliability and statistical significance of the test
