figure_title: (A) In gene set enrichment analyses, CDKN1B expression is related to
  genes upregulated in the normal subtype of breast cancer, genes upregulated by mTOR
  kinase inhibitors, the T-cell receptor signaling pathway, and genes downregulated
  in memory CD8 T cells.
caption: '(A) In gene set enrichment analyses, CDKN1B expression is related to genes
  upregulated in the normal subtype of breast cancer, genes upregulated by mTOR kinase
  inhibitors, the T-cell receptor signaling pathway, and genes downregulated in memory
  CD8 T cells. (B) Bar plots: low CDKN1B expression is associated with a low lymphocyte
  infiltration signature score (p < 0.001), decreased B cells (p < 0.001), increased
  CD4+ T cells (p = 0.938), decreased CD8+ T cells (p = 0.04), high cell proliferation
  (p = 0.04), decreased leukocytes (p < 0.001), decreased M1 macrophages (p = 0.1),
  and increased M2 macrophages (p < 0.001). (C) Low CDKN1B expression is related to
  low interferon-g (IFNG) expression (p = 0.018), elevated Tumor Immune Dysfunction
  and Exclusion (TIDE) signature score (p = 0.065), and decreased cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) (p = 0.002). The immunotherapy response was significantly different
  between low CDKN1B expression and high CDKN1B expression (p = 0.015)'
