caption: (a) Workflow diagram to identify the upstream regulators and signaling pathways
  involved in COVID-19 and PD. The molecules associated with COVID-19 and PD were
  obtained using the IPA “Grow” tool. The overlapping molecules obtained from IPA’s
  “Compare” tool were analyzed using IPA’s “Core Analysis” tool to identify the upstream
  regulators and signaling pathways. (b) Venn diagram of molecules associated with
  COVID-19 and PD identified from the QKB. IPA’s “Compare” tool was employed to identify
  the overlapping molecules associated with COVID-19 and PD. We identified 84 overlapping
  molecules common between the two sets of molecules, and 3 molecules that were chemical
  and biological drugs were removed from further analysis
