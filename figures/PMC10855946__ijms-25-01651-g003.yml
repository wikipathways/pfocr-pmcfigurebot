caption: GO enrichment analysis was performed using GEPIA website to analyze the genes
  with similar expression patterns in the cerebral cortex of CXCL14 in the GTEx database.
  (A) The top 20 Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment terms in Biological Processes (BP),
  Cellular Components (CC), and Molecular Functions (MF) in STAD (Stomach Adenocarcinoma)
  were identified. (B) The main genes in the neural projection pathway were positively
  correlated with CXCL14
