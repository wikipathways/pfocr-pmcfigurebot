caption: The expression of bacterial argA-E fully restored the arginine biosynthetic
  pathway in arg8∆ and arg2∆/arg7∆ mutants. Growth behavior of arg8∆ and arg2∆/arg7∆
  mutants expressing the first five enzymes of the E. coli arginine biosynthetic pathway
  (argA-E) grown in SC medium in the presence or absence of arginine and glucose as
  sole carbon source. (A), Ten-fold serial dilutions of wild-type BY4742 cells and
  various yeast strains were plated. (B), The various yeast strains were inoculated
  in SC medium supplemented with 2% glucose in the presence or absence of arginine.
  The values of optical density at 600 nm refer to cell cultures after the indicated
  periods of growth. Data from three technical replicates are reported. Similar results
  were obtained in three independent experiments
