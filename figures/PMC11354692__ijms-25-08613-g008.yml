caption: 'Model of the mechanism by which CaCl2 mitigates the H2O2 inhibition of pea
  primordial roots toward gravitropism. By summarizing previous research along with
  the results of the present study, it can be hypothesized that CaCl2 may alleviate
  the mechanism of H2O2 inhibition of pea primary root growth toward gravitropism.
  Under the gravitational field, exogenous H2O2 induced oxidative stress responses
  in pea primary roots, which mainly consisted of elevated regulatory POD and SOD
  activities and reduced endogenous H2O2 content. Meanwhile, the reduced H2O2 content
  induced the down-regulation of PGM1 expression and reduced the starch content. This
  altered the gene expression pattern of the downstream calcium signaling and phytohormone
  signaling pathways. We hypothesized that phytohormone signaling may regulate the
  down-regulation of the cell wall extensin EXPA/XTH gene and the increase in lignin
  accumulation, while the application of CaCl2 could alleviate the inhibition of pea
  primary roots toward gravitropism by exogenous H2O2. In the present study, CaCl2
  may have alleviated the inhibition of pea primary root gravitropism by H2O2 by regulating
  the level of oxidative stress in primary roots (a decrease in POD activity and an
  increase in SOD activity), increasing the endogenous H2O2 and starch content, and
  decreasing the lignin accumulation to mitigate the inhibition of pea primary root
  gravitropism by H2O2. Black text: body content (signaling molecules, signaling pathways,
  metabolites, etc.) as obtained from the summary of this study. Black arrows: regulatory
  pathways. Black dashed arrows: possible regulatory pathways. Purple arrows: the
  regulatory pathways of H2O2. Red arrows: the regulatory pathway of CaCl2'
