caption: Model for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–mediated upregulation of T-box
  transcription factor 20 (Tbx20) resulting in increased cardiomyocyte survival. ER
  stress induction for short interval results in upregulation of activating transcription
  factor 6 (Atf6) pathway of unfolded protein response (UPR). Full-length Atf6 is
  cleaved (Atf6-p50), and it translocates to the nucleus where it increases the transcription
  of Tbx20. Increase in the level of Tbx20 results in upregulation of its downstream
  signaling cascade consisting of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2)–pSmad1/5/8.
  Increased expression of Bmp2–pSmad1/5/8 further results in increased cardiomyocyte
  proliferation, thereby restoring homeostasis and increasing the survival of cardiomyocyte
  post ER stress induction. Tbx20 also helps in restoration of homeostasis by decreasing
  apoptosis, fibrosis, and reactive oxygen levels (ROS) levels during ER stress. Increased
  expression of Tbx20 during ER stress also helps to maintain the total pool of Atf6
  during ER stress. A prolonged ER stress however results in decreased expression
  of cleaved Atf6 (Atf6-p50). This in turn results in decrease in the expression of
  Tbx20, and it downstreams Bmp2–pSmad1/5/8 signaling molecules resulting in decreased
  cardiomyocyte proliferation and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Ectopic administration
  of recombinant Bmp2 protein results in upregulation of Bmp2, which in turn upregulates
  Tbx20 in a feed-forward mechanism, thereby restoring homeostasis by increasing cardiomyocyte
  proliferation.
