figure_title: The mechanism of development of AP.
caption: 'The mechanism of development of AP. The main mechanism of AP is the abnormal
  increase in the calcium concentration and abnormal activation of trypsinogen. In
  acinar cells, abnormal elevation of Ca2+ can lead to changes in the mitochondrial
  membrane potential, which leads to activation of the NF-κB pathway and trypsin,
  leading to necrosis of acinar cells. Lysosomes and zymogen granules colocalize,
  and cathepsin B activates trypsinogen by converting it into trypsin, which is released
  into the cytoplasm, leading to autodigestion. After acinar cell injury, some cytokines
  and chemokines can recruit inflammatory cells to the pancreatic tissue, further
  aggravating inflammation and injury to the pancreatic tissue through the signaling
  pathway, and even leading to the failure of other organs (lung and intestines),
  eventually leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The up arrow indicates
  elevated levels and the down arrow indicates decreased levels. Abbreviations: MPTP,
  mitochondrial permeability transition pore; MODS, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa-B; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MCP1, monocyte chemotactic Protein
  1; CXCL, C-X-C ligand; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Nrf2, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2'
