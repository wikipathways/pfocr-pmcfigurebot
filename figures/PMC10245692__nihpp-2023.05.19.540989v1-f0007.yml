figure_title: Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis from mice fed a NASH diet for up
  to 30 weeks
caption: Venn diagrams report the numbers of both up- and down-regulated genes (A
  and B, respectively) in mice fed a NASH diet or a control diet for up to 30 weeks.
  Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes that are common to all time points
  or specific to the 30-week time point alone are also reported (C and D, respectively)
