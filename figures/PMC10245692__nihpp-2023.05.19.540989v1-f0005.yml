figure_title: Hepatic transcriptome from mice fed a NASH diet for 20 weeks
caption: Effect of feeding male mice either a control diet (10% kcal from fat) or
  NASH diet (40% kcal from fat, 20% kcal fructose, and 2% cholesterol) for 20 weeks
  on hepatic gene expression. Heat map of the top 40 differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs; A). Pathways related to fibrosis, including Hepatic Fibrosis Signaling Pathway
  and Pulmonary Fibrosis Idiopathic Signaling Pathway, are activated in the liver
  of animals fed a NASH diet for 20 weeks compared to a control diet (B). Orange bars
  denote activated pathways (positive z-score > 2), whereas blue bars denote inhibited
  pathways (negative z-score <âˆ’ 2.0). Putative upstream regulators of the DEGs at
  this time point include fibrosis-related molecules such as TGFB1 and AGT (C). In
  the liver of mice fed a NASH diet, the gene set for collagen fibril organization
  is significantly enriched (D). Genes related to fibrosis, including Aebp1, Col1a1,
  Col1a2, Mmp2, Mmp13, and Timp1, are significantly upregulated in the liver of mice
  fed the NASH diet for 20 weeks, compared to the control diet (E). Statistical significance
  was determined by t-test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. * p < 0.05, ** p
  <0.01
