figure_title: Pathway for the synthesis of flavonoid compounds in strain B1075.
caption: Pathway for the synthesis of flavonoid compounds in strain B1075. (a) Enzyme
  genes in strain B1075 predicted to be associated with the biosynthetic pathway are
  highlighted in red. Enzyme gene with sequence similarity below 30% is displayed
  in black, and the catalytic step is indicated by dashed line. TAL, tyrosine ammonia-lyase;
  4CL, 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; FNS,
  flavone synthase. (b) Homologous sequences of CHS with similarity exceeding 60%
  were obtained by amino acid sequence alignment of strain B1075 through NCBI. Among
  them, the amino acid sequence similarity of GAT73531.1 reached 82.94%, represented
  by a gradient from yellow to blue, with higher similarity shown in yellow and lower
  similarity in blue. Protein domain prediction of the CHS fragment (encoded by the
  gene CHS) in strain B1075 was conducted using InterPro. Blue bar represents the
  N-terminal domain of chalcone and stilbene synthases identified in CHS of B1075.
  Yellow bar represents the C-terminal domain of chalcone and stilbene synthases identified
  in CHS of B1075. Graphical representation was generated using Jalview 2.11.3.0
