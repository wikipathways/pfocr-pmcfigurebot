figure_title: PaPDS positively regulates β-carotene accumulation in apricots.
caption: 'PaPDS positively regulates β-carotene accumulation in apricots. (A) Coloration
  of ‘Yinbai’ injected with PaPDS overexpression Agrobacterium plasmid mixture (pBWA-X15-PaPDS,
  pBWA-JTY-PaPDS). An empty pBWA vector was used as a control. (B) Determination of
  carotenoid content in overexpression experiments. (C) Relative expression levels
  of β-carotene synthesis pathway genes in overexpression experiments. (D) Coloration
  of ‘Pingguoxing’ injected with PaPDS silencing Agrobacterium plasmid mixture (TRV1
  + TRV2: PaPDS). An empty TRV1 + TRV2 vector was used as a control. (E) Determination
  of carotenoid content in silencing experiments. (F) Relative expression levels of
  β-carotene synthesis pathway genes in silencing experiments. The different letters
  represent significant differences (LSD test, p < 0.05). The asterisks indicate significant
  differences (** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns: not significant) based on the Student’s
  t-test'
