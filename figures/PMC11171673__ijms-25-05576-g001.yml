caption: 'Schematic diagram of the RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathway. When G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) bind to various ligands, such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), angiotensin
  II, and TGF-Î², they activate guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and, in
  turn, activate RhoA by converting it from an inactive GDP-bound state to an active
  GTP-bound form. This activation triggers the ROCK cascade, leading to the phosphorylation
  of downstream target proteins and subsequent cytoskeletal modifications. These changes
  cause contraction of the trabecular meshwork, reducing aqueous outflow through the
  conventional pathway and increasing intraocular pressure (IOP). ROCK inhibitors
  reduce IOP by blocking this cascade. GAP: GTPase-activating protein. ERM: ezrin-radixin-moesin.
