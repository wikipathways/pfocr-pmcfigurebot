figure_title: Effects of EVO on core target levels and the renin angiotensin pathway
  in the hippocampus of SPS-induced PTSD mice.
caption: 'Effects of EVO on core target levels and the renin angiotensin pathway in
  the hippocampus of SPS-induced PTSD mice. (A) Evaluation of ACE, REN, ADRB2, and
  PTGS2 expression in the hippocampus of mice across each group. (B) Immunofluorescence
  staining of ACE in the CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus in each
  group of mice; magnification ×400 (scale bar: 50 μm). Immunofluorescence staining
  of mouse brain slices in the hippocampal region of mice stained blue and red for
  ACE expression. (C) Mean optical densities of the CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG regions
  in the hippocampus of mice in each group. Data are presented as means ± standard
  deviations (n = 3). Compared with the CON group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; compared
  with the SPS group, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01'
