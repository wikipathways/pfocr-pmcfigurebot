caption: VHL-mediated signaling/regulatory pathways in ccRCC with respect to PAX involvement.
  The loss of VHL leads to HIFα accumulation and translocation into the nucleus, which
  subsequently activates the transcription of HIF target genes that are involved in
  critical oncogenic pathways (such as HIF-based hypoxia signaling pathway, TGF-β
  signaling pathway, VEGF-related signaling pathways, MYC-related signaling pathways,
  and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway). Loss of VHL promotes the progression and metastasis
  of RCC, wherein PAX genes also exert a positive contribution
