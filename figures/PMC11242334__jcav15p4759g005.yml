figure_title: Bioinformatics analysis of the TLE4 gene in thyroid carcinoma (TCGA-THCA)
  dataset.
caption: Bioinformatics analysis of the TLE4 gene in thyroid carcinoma (TCGA-THCA)
  dataset. A. Expression analysis of TLE4, demonstrating significantly lower expression
  levels in thyroid carcinoma compared to paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. B.
  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis evaluating the diagnostic
  utility of TLE4 in differentiating thyroid carcinoma from non-cancerous tissues.
  C. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models exploring the prognostic
  significance of TLE4, showing that patients with lower levels of TLE4 expression
  have a poorer prognosis. D. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identifying pathways
  differentially enriched among upregulated genes in correlation with low TLE4 expression.
  E. GSEA of downregulated genes associated with TLE4 expression, highlighting enriched
  pathways that involve signaling mechanisms and cellular metabolism
