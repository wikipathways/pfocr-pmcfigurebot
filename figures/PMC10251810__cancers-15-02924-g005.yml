caption: LEMD1 promotes cell proliferation and invasion by activating ERK in TNBC.
  (A) Signaling pathway enrichment analysis of siNC and siLEMD1 MDA-MB-468 cells by
  RNA-seq. (B) LEMD1 was knocked out by LEMD1-targeting CRISPER/CAS9 system in MDA-MB-468
  cells and was knocked down by LEMD1 shRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells. The expressions of
  ERK, p-ERK were examined by Western blot. β-actin was used as a loading control.
  (C) LEMD1-knockout MDA-MB-468 cells and LEMD1-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected
  with ERK plasmid and then treated with U0126, an ERK inhibitor. The expressions
  of ERK, p-ERK, Flag were examined by Western blot. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
  LEMD1-knockout MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with ERK plasmid or empty vector
  plasmid. Cell viability was measured using the CCK8 assay (D) and EdU assay (E),
  magnification ×200. Additionally, LEMD1-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected
  with ERK plasmid or empty vector plasmid. Cell proliferation was measured via colony
  formation assay (F). Cell migration ability was measured via Transwell migration
  assay (G). Magnification ×200. (H) The protein expressions of EMT markers including
  E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and (I) The expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax in LEMD1-knockout
  MDA-MB-468 cells were measured via Western blot. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
  (J) LEMD1-knockout MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with ERK plasmid and then treated
  with U0126 for 24 h. Cell viability was measured using the CCK8 assay. ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, n = 3. The original western blot figures could be found in Supplementary
