caption: Effect of trichostatin A (TSA) on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (DDP). (a)
  Structure of DDP and TSA. (b,c) IC50 curves (b) and IC50 values (c) of DDP for A549
  cells in the presence (black line) or absence (red line) of TSA (1 μM) (n = 3).
  (d) Apoptosis assays for A549 cells exposed to A549 cells treated with cisplatin
  (8 μM), TSA (1 μM), or both DDP and TSA. (e) Percentage of late stage of apoptotic
  A549 cells treated under different conditions (n = 3). (f,g) Immunofluorescence
  images showing the expression level of cleaved-caspase 3 (f) and cleaved-caspase
  6 (g) in A549 cells treated under different conditions. (h) Western blotting data
  showing the changes in the level of full-length (FL-) and cleaved (c-)PARP in A549
  cells treated under different conditions. GAPDH was used as an internal reference.
  (i) Relative abundance to GAPDH of FL-PARP/c-PARP measured by Western blot assay
  (n = 3). (j) Western blotting data showing the changes in the level of lamin A&C
  in A549 cells treated under different conditions. GAPDH was used as an internal
  reference. (k) Relative abundance to GAPDH of lamin A&C measured by Western blot
  assay (n = 3). (l) Histograms of population distribution at different cell cycles
  of A549 cells treated under different conditions (n = 3). (m,n) Western blotting
  data showing the changes in the level of phosphorylated proteins involved in the
  ATM-CHK2-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway. GAPDH was used as an internal reference to calculate
  the relative abundance of the phosphorylated proteins (n = 3). In the panels (c,e,i–k,m),
  the data are presented as means ± SD; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and
  **** p < 0.0001 (Student’s t test)
