caption: Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by the combination of CFI-402257
  and AICAR. (A) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of PI3K/Akt/mTOR-related
  proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells. (B) Representative histogram of the protein expression
  levels. The values represent the mean ± SEM. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs.
