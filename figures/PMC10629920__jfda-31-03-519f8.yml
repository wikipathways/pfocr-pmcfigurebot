figure_title: Autophagy–urea cycle pathway is essential for the statin-mediated nitric
  oxide bioavailability in endothelial cells
caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed molecular mechanisms by which simvastatin
  elicits TRPV1-AMPK signaling and in turn activates the autophagy–urea cycle pathway
  to induce an increase in L-arginine bioavailability, leading to NO production in
  ECs
