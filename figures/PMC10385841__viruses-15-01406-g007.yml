figure_title: Canonical pathway analysis of PIE response following individual G9P[13]
  infection vs.
caption: 'Canonical pathway analysis of PIE response following individual G9P[13]
  infection vs. control (non-infected PIE) and G5P[7] infection vs. control (non-infected
  PIE) performed using Qiagen IPA. Canonical pathways listed for G5P[7] are as follows:
  Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), sperm motility, ID1, growth hormone, eicosanoid, breast
  cancer regulation by stathmin 1, S100 family, and phagosome formation. Canonical
  pathways listed for G9P[13] are as follows: ABRA, Oxytocin, UVC-induced MAPK, actin
  cytoskeleton, endocannabinoid cancer inhibition, regulation of cellular mechanics
  by calpain protease, CDX gastrointestinal cancer, serotonin receptor, mismatch repair
  in eukaryotes, CXCR4, ILK, S100 family, thrombin signaling, senescence, role of
  tissue factor in cancer, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, cardiac
  hypertrophy, role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, endothelin-1, and kinetochore
  metaphase. Canonical pathway analysis was conducted using the IPA library and showed
  the most significant contributions through the input data set. For canonical pathway
  analysis, the −log (p-value) > 1.3 was taken as the threshold and the z-score >
  2 was defined as the threshold for significant activation, while a z-score < −2
  was defined as the threshold for significant inhibition. Bars indicate the activation
  z-score; blue symbols represent p values in log10 format'
