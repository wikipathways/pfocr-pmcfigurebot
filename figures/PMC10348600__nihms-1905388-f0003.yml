figure_title: HSEs possess an EMT-like gene expression signature driven by EGF signaling
caption: (A) Cell-cell communication networks predicted for the EGF signaling pathway
  inferred using the R package CellChat. Edge weights represent the probability of
  signaling between cell clusters.(B) Relative contributions of each ligand, receptor,
  and cofactor group to the cell-cell communication predicted in (A).(C) Feature plots
  showing the expression patterns of EGFR and each of the ligands contributing to
  the EGF signaling network.(D) Violin plots of relative gene expression for positive
  markers (VIM, LAMC2, and LGALS1) and negative markers (CDH1) of EMT.(E) Visualization
  of signaling probability scores of ligand-receptor/co-receptor pairs involving LAMC2
  for GelHSE and FibHSE datasets. In vivo datasets had no imputed signaling interactions
  involving LAMC2. Dot size represents p value.(F) Feature plots (top) and violin
  plots (bottom) showing the relative EMT gene score for each cell and cluster, separated
  by sample type.(G) Immunostaining of SLUG in the FibHSE, GelHSE, and in vivo samples.
  Scale bar, 100 μm.(H) Immunostaining of VIM in FibHSEs supplemented with the indicated
  concentrations of EGF. Quantification of VIM staining intensity is shown on the
  right. n = 3 each condition. One-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine significance.
