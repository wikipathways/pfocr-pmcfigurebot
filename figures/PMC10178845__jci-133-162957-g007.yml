caption: '(A) Representative microscopy images of Oil Red O, an esterified cholesterol
  and LD marker, counterstained with hematoxylin as a nuclear marker, and its (B)
  Feret’s diameter and (C) number/cell quantification. DEGS1 patient (n = 5) and control
  (n = 5) fibroblasts. (D) PA and glyceride levels. DEGS1 patient (n = 4) and control
  (n = 4) fibroblasts. mRNA levels of (E) genes encoding key enzymes involved in the
  LD synthesis pathway DGKA, DGAT1, and DGAT2, and (F) the lipogenic gene master regulators
  SREBF1a, SREBF1c, and SREBF2. DEGS1 patient (n = 4–5) and control (n = 5) fibroblasts.
  (G) mRNA levels of SREBF target genes involved in cholesterol synthesis: HMGCS1,
  HMGCR, MVD, and SQLE. DEGS1 patient (n = 4) and control (n = 4) fibroblasts. (H)
  CE/FC lipid ratio and (I) PS, PE, and PC lipid levels in human fibroblasts from
  patients with DEGS1 mutations (n = 4–5) and control individuals (n = 4–5). All experiments
  were done in triplicate. Data are presented as box-and-whisker plots (median, interquartile
  interval, minimum, maximum). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001, 2-tailed Student’s
