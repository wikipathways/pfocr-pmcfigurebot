  and HFD + collagen mice by using PICRUST2.
caption: The predicted functional potential changes between HFD + vehicle mice and
  HFD + collagen mice by using PICRUST2. (A) The boxplots showed the relative abundance
  in 27 pathways related to obesity. There were 17 significantly increased pathways
  and 10 decreased pathways in HFD + collagen compared to HFD + vehicle. (B) The PCA
  analysis of intestinal bacterial metabolic pathway, the orange color indicates HFD
  + vehicle mice and the green color indicates HFD + collagen mice. (C) The extended
  error bar chart showed the significant difference in the predicted functional pathways
  related to obesity between the two groups. The middle value represents the mean
  differences between the two groups (upper-lower bar value), and the error bar represents
  the 95% confidence intervals with the effect size of difference in mean proportion.
  The p-value at the side indicates the significance between the upper and lower bars.
  (D) Heatmaps were drawn with normalized relative abundances in 27 obesity-related
  pathways in the two groups. The red colors represent a higher abundance and blue
  colors a lower abundance. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001
