figure_title: Impact of HU on the expression of CRAB genes coding for K+ transport
  and benzoate and cysteine pathway functions.
caption: 'Impact of HU on the expression of CRAB genes coding for K+ transport and
  benzoate and cysteine pathway functions. Benzoate pathway genes are upregulated
  in both strains, AB5075 and AMA 40, in transcriptomics studies (A) and corroborated
  by qRT-PCR (B). Expression of genes involved in the high-affinity potassium transporter
  are downregulated in both strains of A. baumannii studied (C and D). Cysteine metabolic
  pathway genes are also downregulated in the presence of HU for both strains AB5075
  and AMA40 shown by transcriptomic analyses (E) and by qPCR (F). Statistical significance
  (P < 0.05) was determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparison
  test. Significance was indicated as follows: *** indicates P <0.001; ** P <0.01,
  and * P <0.05'
