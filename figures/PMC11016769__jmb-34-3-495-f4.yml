figure_title: LE activates protein synthesis pathway and decreases atrophy markers
  in obese sarcopenic mice
caption: (A) Western blots for expression of MHC isoforms in skeletal muscle (left
  panel) and the densitometric analysis (right panel). (B) Western blots for expression
  of AKT-mTOR pathway in skeletal muscle (left panel) and the densitometric analysis
  (right panel). (C) Western blots for expression of atrophy markers (left panel)
  and their densitometric analysis (right panel). Data are presented as mean ± standard
  error of the mean (SEM). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 versus HFD group.
  ND, normal diet fed group; HFD, high-fat diet fed group; HFD+LE, high-fat diet supplemented
  with 0.25% LE extract. Statistically significant differences were determined using
  one-way ANOVA followed by Tuckey’s post-hoc test
