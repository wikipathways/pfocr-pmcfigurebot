figure_title: Interrogation of pY functional role by coupling isotope labeled tracing
  and CRISPRi-rescue validates regulatory role of IDH1 Y391 and UMPS Y37 on enzyme
  activity
caption: (A) U-13C5-Glutamine stable isotope tracing scheme to evaluate the role of
  IDH1 Y391 which is positioned in the NADP binding domain (PDB:1t0l)92. (B) Fraction
  labeling of citrate and aspartate via oxidative (blue) and reductive (red) TCA cycle
  over 0, 60, or 120min in A549 sgIDH1 CRISPRi-rescue cell lines (N=4). Knockdown-rescue
  was achieved by adding 500ng/mL of Dox, replenished daily, to culture media for
  a total of 96 hours. Total ion counts were normalized to Norvaline internal standard
  and total protein content, and fraction labeling was calculated by taking the ratio
  of each labeled species divided by the total pool size. (C) Pool sizes of citrate
  and aspartate at 120min (N=4). Pool sizes were calculated by summing all species
  of each metabolite per condition. Data available in Table S8(A – C). (D) Model showing
  pY391 activating IDH1 to induce reductive carboxylation of aKG to citrate. (E) U-13C5-Glutamine
  stable isotope tracing scheme for 0, 12, or 24 hours to measure changes in de novo
  pyrimidine synthesis pathway in A549 sgUMPS CRISPRi-rescue cell lines treated with
  dox for 96 hours total. (F) Total ion counts of M+4 labeled and total de novo pyrimidine
  synthesis intermediates carbamoyl aspartate, dihydroorotate, and orotate (N=4).
  (G) Extracellular orotate and dihydroorotate were measured from media collected
  at the 24 hours timepoint. Data available in Table S8(D – G). (H) model for pY37-mediated
  inhibition of UMPS enzyme activity
