caption: Effect of FABP5-KO on malignant characteristics of 22RV1 cells and on the
  levels of downstream proteins of the FABP5 signaling pathway. (A) Microscopical
  appearances of 22RV1-FABP5-KO cells and their parental 22RV1 cells. (B) Effect of
  FABP5-KO on proliferation of 22RV1 cells. C) Effect of FABP5-KO on invasion of 22RV1
  cells. (D) Quantitative assessment of the numbers of invasive cells. (E) Effect
  of FABP5-KO on anchorage-independent growth of 22RV1 cells. (F) Quantitative assessment
  on cell colony numbers formed in soft agar. (G) Effect of FABP5-KO on motility of
  22RV1 cells. (H) Quantitative assessment of the average wound width of the space
  of the gap (μm) at different times is shown. (I) Western blot analysis of PPARγ1
  and PPARγ2 in 22RV1 and in 22RV1-FABP5-KO cells. (J) Relative levels of PPARγ1 and
  PPARγ2. The levels of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 in 22RV1 cells were each set at '1', and
  their levels in 22RV1-FABP5-KO cells were obtained by comparing with those in 22RV1.
  (K) Western blot analysis of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2 in 22RV1 and in 22RV1-FABP5-KO
  cells. (L) Relative levels of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2. The levels of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2
  in 22RV1 were each set at '1', and those in 22RV1-FABP5-KO cells were obtained by
  comparing with those in 22RV1. (M) Western blot analysis of VEGF in 22RV1 and in
  22RV1-FABP5-KO cells. (N) Relative levels of VEGF protein. The level of VEGF in
  22RV1 cells was set at '1', and the level of VEGF in 22RV1-FABP5-KO cells was obtained
  by comparing with that in 22RV1. (O) Western blot analysis of ARFL and ARV7 in 22RV1
  and in 22RV1-FABP5-KO cells. (P) Relative levels of ARFL and ARV7. Levels of ARFL
  and ARV7 in 22RV1 cells were set at '1', and the levels of ARFL and ARV7 in 22RV1-FABP5-KO
  cells were obtained by comparing with those in 22RV1. The protein relative levels
  were reproduced independently three times, and the differences were assessed by
  Student's t-test. Results were considered significant when P<0.05. **P<0.001, ***P<0.0001
  and ****P<0.00001. KO, knockout; FABP5, fatty acid-binding protein 5; AR, androgen
  receptor; ARFL, full-length AR; ARV7, AR splicing variant 7; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ; pPPARγ, phosphorylated PPARγ; ns, not statistically significant
