caption: The correlation between seven specific pathways and overexpressed genes in
  the first 12 myeloid cell clusters from healthy, alive, and dead populations. There
  is a significant difference in the function of MDSC clusters with highly upregulated
  TEs compared to other myeloid cell types. MDSC clusters were cluster 11 of healthy
  samples (a), clusters 7 and 8 of alive patients (b), and cluster 4 of dead patients
  (c). MDSC clusters showed a negative correlation with neutrophil functions such
  as degranulation, activation involved in immune response, immunity, and migration.
  However, some pathways, including the Toll receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling
  pathway, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway, were positively associated with the function
  of MDSCs
