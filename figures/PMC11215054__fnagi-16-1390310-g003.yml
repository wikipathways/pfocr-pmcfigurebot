caption: GSEA analysis for microglia DEGs. (A) GSEA two-way bar plot microglia DEGs.
  (B) Visualization of GSEA results for microglia DEGs. (C) Visualization of GSEA
  results for “VEGF signaling pathway.” (D) Visualization of GSEA results for “Inflammatory
  mediator regulation of TRP channels.” (E) Visualization of GSEA results for “Cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interaction.” (F) Visualization of GSEA results for “Fc gamma R-mediated
  phagocytosis.” Demonstrating the first 5 pathways, NES > 0, activated; NES < 0,
  inhibited.
