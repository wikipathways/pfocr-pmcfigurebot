figure_title: Genomics of Con, IMQ, IMQ+LCAA and IMQ+LCAA-PSF groups from dorsal skin
  samples.
caption: 'Genomics of Con, IMQ, IMQ+LCAA and IMQ+LCAA-PSF groups from dorsal skin
  samples. Transcriptomic profiles of Con, IMQ, IMQ+LCAA and IMQ+LCAA-PSF groups dorsal
  skin samples were determined by RNA-seq. (A) Hierarchical clustering heatmap depicting
  individual samples showed differential gene expression patterns between Con, IMQ,
  IMQ+LCAA and IMQ+LCAA-PSF groups. The colors at the top of the heat map indicate
  the following: black indicates the Con group; red indicates the IMQ group; blue
  indicates the IMQ+LCAA group; and green indicates the IMQ+LCAA-PSF group. The map
  with color in the upper and outer quadrants represents differential gene expression,
  with blue indicating a relative decrease and red indicating a relative increase
  in abundance. Selected top 290 gene represents (n = 3 per group). Gene ontology
  (GO) themes enriched in IMQ versus Con and IMQ+LCAA-PSF versus IMQ dorsal skin tissue
  in mice. IMQ versus Con resulting (B) the top 20 gene ontology biological process
  (BP) terms with the highest statistical significance. The vertical axis is the GOBP
  terms, and the horizontal axis is the number of genes. The top 20 gene ontology
  molecular function (MF) terms with the highest statistical significance. The vertical
  axis is the GOMF terms, and the horizontal axis is the number of genes. The top
  20 gene ontology cellular component (CC) terms with the highest statistical significance.
  The vertical axis is the GOCC terms, and the horizontal axis is the number of genes.
  GOBP database (C) inflammatory response pathway, (D) leukocyte proliferation pathway,
  (E) T cell proliferation pathway, (F) skin development, (G) regulation of water
  loss via skin, (H) regulation of proteolysis GSEA signatures in IMQ were compared
  with Con. NES and P value were obtained by GSEA in the HALLMARK database'
