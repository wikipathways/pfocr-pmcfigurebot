  of cells to bacterial invasion.
caption: Regulation of lncRNAs in autophagy, apoptosis response, and inflammation
  of cells to bacterial invasion. (a) Regulation of lncRNAs in autophagy and apoptosis
  response. IFN-γ production is regulated by lncRNAs such as SORS1, CD244, or IFNG-AS1.
  iNOS production is positively regulated by linc-Cox2. LincRNA-EPS, PCED1B-AS1, and
  MEG3, which inhibit autophagy, are also dysregulated upon bacterial infections.
  (b) Regulation of lncRNAs in inflammatory pathway. T-cell receptors (TCR) sense
  extracellular LPS/LTA and activate NF-κB or type I IFN production through the myeloid
  differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) pathway
