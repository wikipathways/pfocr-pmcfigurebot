caption: NAM inhibits DCs maturation and Ag presentation. (A) Schematic illustration
  of the NAM salvage pathway. (B) GSEA analysis of NAM salvage pathway in LPS-stimulated
  activated DCs from the GEO dataset (GSE185881). (C) Relative abundances of NAM in
  LPS-stimulated DCs at different time points. (D) Representative flow overlay histograms
  and statistical analysis of the expression levels of CD80, CD86, MHC-I, and MHC-II
  in vehicle- or NAM-treated BMDCs after stimulation with LPS (n = 3). (E) Statistical
  analysis of the expression levels of CD80, CD86, MHC-I, and MHC-II in vehicle- or
  NMN-treated BMDCs after stimulation with LPS (n = 3). (F) The percentage of EGFP+YAe+
  cells in vehicle- or NAM-treated BMDCs after in vitro antigen uptake and presentation
  assay with Eα peptide (n = 3). (G) The percentage of EGFP+YAe+ cells in vehicle-
  or NMN-treated BMDCs after in vitro antigen uptake and presentation assay with Eα
  peptide (n = 3). Data are presented as means ± SD. *** p < 0.001; NS, not significant.
