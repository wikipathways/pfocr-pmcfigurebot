caption: 'A. Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway and Tor pathway signaling. Strains
  with heterozygous mutations in the genes listed in orange were created for the following
  experiments. Intermediates listed as numbers in the figure are as follows: 1. 5-o-1-carboxyvinyl-3-phosphoshikimate
  2. Chorismate 3. Prephenate 4. P-Hydroxyphenyl Pyruvic Acid 5. Phenylpyruvate 6.
  Anthranilate 7. N-5-Phospho-B-d-ribosylanthranilate 8. 1-(2-Carboxylphenyl amino)-1-deoxy-1-ribulose-5-phosphate
  9. 3-Indoyl-glycerol phosphate 10. Indole B. ΔΔCt values from qRT-PCR trials for
  nitrogen starved and amino acid starved wildtype strains, depicting differences
  in gene expression for RPL9A , GAP1 , MEP2 . Positive values indicate decreased
  expression and negative values indicate increased expression compared to wildtype.
  In each box plot, the bottom whisker shows the minimum value, the bottom of the
  box represents quartile 1 (Q1), the middle of the box is the median (Q2), the top
  of the box represents the upper quartile (Q3), and the top whisker shows the maximum
  value. The single asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference from
  wildtype, and the double asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference
  between the bracket connected strains. C. ΔΔCt values of qRT-PCR trials for mutant
  strains of interest. Formatted identical to Fig. 1B. D. Percent increase in autophagy
  induction compared to wildtype from western blot analysis. Asterisks signify statistically
  significant results compared to wildtype.'
