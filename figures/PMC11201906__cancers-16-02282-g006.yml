caption: Cancer signaling pathway investigation using overexpression and knockdown
  of SMARCD3 (Wnt, PI3-AKT, and MAPK pathway). (A) Overexpression study in MKN 74
  cells. (B) Overexpression study in KATO III. (C) Knockdown study in SNU 601. (D)
  Knockdown study in SNU 668. Data are presented as the mean ± SD for triplicate independent
  experiments, and the error bars indicate SD. Statistical analysis was performed
  by two-way ANOVA(A). * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001
