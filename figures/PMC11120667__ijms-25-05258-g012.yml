figure_title: Proposed model of the mechanisms of action of female M.
caption: Proposed model of the mechanisms of action of female M. pomifera on ER-positive
  MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells. Similar to the mechanisms of action of male
  plant extract, M. pomifera female extract also (1) activates TRPV1, and initiates
  (1a) mitochondrial intrinsic, (1b) extrinsic, (1c) ERK-dependent, and (1d) ER-stress-mediated
  apoptosis. (1e) In addition, female M. pomifera extract downregulates the PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway. It may be that plant extracts activate the FAS/FADD pathway directly
