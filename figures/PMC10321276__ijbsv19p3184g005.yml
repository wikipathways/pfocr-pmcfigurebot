  5A-5B. Western blotting was used to evaluate the effect of NADK knockdown on the
  phosphorylation of Smad1/5/9 in H157 and A549 cells. Tet-on system was used to knock
  down NADK upon the administration of DOX. 5C. Phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/9
  were examined in A549, H157, HBE cells with the overexpression of NADK. 5D. QPCR
  assays were used to detect the effects of NADK over-expression on the induction
  of ID1 mRNA level upon the treatment of BMP-2. 5E-F. The levels of Phosphorylated
  Smad1/5/9 in the xenografts derived from the cells with overexpression or knockdown
  of NADK were examined by IHC and analysed. The scale bars were indicated. **, P<0.01;
