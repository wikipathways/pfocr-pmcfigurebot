figure_title: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for MAPK signaling pathway–plant
  (ko04016) in K.
caption: 'Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for MAPK signaling pathway–plant (ko04016)
  in K. obovata and A. marina. DEGs encoding these genes are represented by boxes
  next to the gene names, and their differential expression after chilling treatment
  is color-coded. FC represents the fold change after chilling stress compared to
  the control. (a) All DEGs enriched in MAPK signaling pathway–plant (ko04016). (b)
  A possible signal transduction model of the chilling tolerance mechanism. After
  signal reception, stress-activated ROS signaling and hormone signaling modulate
  the MAPK signaling pathway, such as transcription factors and kinases. PYR/PYL:
  abscisic acid receptor PYR/PYL family; MKK: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase;
  MAPKKK17_18: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 17/18; MPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; MEKK1: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1; CAT1: catalase;
  OXI1: serine/threonine-protein kinase OXI1; ACS1: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate
  synthase 1; ETR/ERS: ethylene receptor; CTR1: serine/threonine-protein kinase CTR1;
  EIN3/EIL: ethylene-insensitive protein 3; ERF: ethylene-responsive transcription
  factor 1'
