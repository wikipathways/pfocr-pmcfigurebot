caption: External evaluation of the UbRG signature. (a) A heatmap depicting 20 differentially
  expressed genes within the prognostic UbRG signature is shown. (b) Boxplot visualizations
  of these 20 differentially expressed genes within the prognostic UbRG signature
  are provided. Asterisks ** and *** denote the significance levels of 0.01 and 0.001,
  respectively. (c) Enrichment plots highlight gene enrichment in the low-risk group
  for hematopoietic cell lineage (orange), neuroactive ligand receptor interaction
  (green), tyrosine metabolism (pink), B cell receptor signaling pathway (red), and
  primary immunodeficiency (blue). No gene enrichment was detected in the high-risk
  group. (d) A Sankey diagram depicts the relationship between nine risk genes in
  the prognostic UbRGs (on the left) and 24 transcription factors (TFs) (on the right).
  The height of the boxes represents the proportion of risk genes and TF types, with
  lines indicating their associations. (e) Another Sankey diagram illustrates the
  connections between 12 risk genes in the prognostic UbRGs (left) and 25 enhancer
  RNAs (eRNAs) (right). UbRGs stands for ubiquitination-related genes; TF refers to
  transcription factor; eRNA signifies enhancer RNA
