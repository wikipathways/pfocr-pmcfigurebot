caption: The roles of O-GlcNAcylation modification in AD. (A) O-GlcNAcylation utilizes
  UDP-GlcNAc as donors produced by the HBP pathway; OGA and OGT regulated the O-GlcNAc
  level, while kinase and phosphatase modulated the protein phosphorylation level;
  elevated O-GlcNAc level is conducive to ameliorating AD symptoms. (B) Increased
  O-GlcNAcylation activated the non-amyloidogenic pathway and facilitated endocytosis
  evasion of APP, thereby reducing Aβ generation.
