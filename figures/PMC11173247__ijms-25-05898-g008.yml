figure_title: Wound-induced genes involved in plant–insect interactions in arabidopsis
  WT and lox2 mutants.
caption: 'Wound-induced genes involved in plant–insect interactions in arabidopsis
  WT and lox2 mutants. Foliar gene expression in wounded lox2 mutants, which has a
  truncated non-functional enzyme, was compared to WT plants. Proteins encoded by
  early genes (1 h) are shown in blue, whereas later transcript expression (12 h)
  is depicted in brown. (A). General wound-induced responses found in both genotypes.
  Jasmonate biosynthesis begins in the chloroplast from 18C membrane lipid-derived
  precursors, typically α-linolenic acid, to finally form one of the biologically
  active jasmonates, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile). Numerous genes encoding enzymes
  in the jasmonate biosynthetic pathway are upregulated in wounded plants. JA-Ile
  enters the nucleus and forms a bridge between the SCFCOI1 and jasmonate ZIM domain
  (JAZ) repressors, leading to their degradation through the proteasome. The degradation
  of JAZ proteins releases MYC2/3/4 transcription factors, leading to jasmonate-responsive
  gene expression. The abscisic acid (ABA)-PYL6 receptor complex positively interacts
  with MYC2. Genes encoding JAZ-negative regulators as well as those further metabolizing
  jasmonic acid (JA) (i.e., JOX, ST2A) to inactive derivatives are also wound-induced.
  Gibberellin (GA) bound to its receptor GID1 activates a pathway that leads to the
  proteasome-mediated degradation of negative DELLA growth regulators, such as RGL3.
  In wounded leaves, the increase in RGL3 expression and genes that encode GA2OX6
  and GA2OX8, involved in gibberellin metabolism to inactive products, results in
  the suppression of plant growth. Numerous genes involved in oxidative stress are
  wound-induced. For example, the oxidative stress-associated transcription factor
  RRTF1 and MDAR3, which are part of the Foyer–Halliwell–Asada cycle, a series of
  interconnected enzymatic reactions to detoxify the reactive oxygen species hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2). Wound-induced MYB15 leads to the expression of ELI3/CAD8 and PRX52,
  which contribute to lignin biosynthesis. TPS04 and CYP82G1 are involved in the biosynthesis
  of volatiles, such as 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT), that are
  attractive to natural enemies of the herbivorous insect. TI1 and NATA1 contribute
  to plant resistance against arthropods, whereas MAPKKK21 is a negative regulator
  of arthropod resistance. (B). LOX2-specific responses. Wound-induced genes expressed
  at higher levels in WT compared with lox2 plants. Wound-induced expression of genes
  that encode LOX2 and MYC2 involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and signaling, respectively,
  is noted. CORI3 is a cysteine lyase involved in cysteine biosynthesis that produces
  precursors for ethylene, aliphatic glucosinolates (GSLs) and reduced glutathione
  (GSH) involved in the Foyer–Halliwell–Asada cycle. Also, the expression of the gene
  encoding DHAR1 in this pathway is wound-induced. Other cellular antioxidants whose
  biosynthetic pathway is positively regulated in these plants are anthocyanins. Indirect
  defenses involved in volatile biosynthesis are wound-induced. An increase the genes
  that encode proteins involved in antinutritive defenses, such as CLH1, ARGAH2 and
  TIs, as well as MAPKKK17, an important signaling kinase involved in arthropod resistance,
  is also seen. Abbreviations: ABA: abscisic acid, AOC: allene oxide cyclase, AOS:
