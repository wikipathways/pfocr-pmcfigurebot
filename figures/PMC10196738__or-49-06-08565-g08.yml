caption: 'Analyses of tumor suppression-related proteins and NF-κB signaling pathway
  proteins in CT26 tumors in BALB/cKorl syngeneic mice. Protein expression levels
  of (A) p53, MDM2 and p27, and (B) p-NF-κB, p-IκB-α and IκB-α proteins in CT26 tumor
  homogenates were analyzed using specific antibodies. The level of each protein was
  normalized to β-actin. The tissue homogenates was prepared from two to three tumors
  per group and western blots were analyzed twice for each sample. The data was presented
  as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05 vs. Vehicle group. #P<0.05 vs. Cis group. p, phosphorylated;
  AEC, aqueous extract of Ecklonia cava; Cis, cisplatin; Lo, low concentration; Mi,
  middle concentration; Hi, high concentration; MDM2, mouse double minute 2'
