figure_title: Multi-scale spatial co-expression network analysis reveals systems-level
  transcriptome alterations in AD
caption: 'a, Dendrogram shows the of partitioning 166 gene co-expression modules into
  15 brain-wide meta-modules. Network plot in the center represents a consensus co-expression
  network constructed from grey matter cortical clusters and white matter, where each
  dot represents a gene colored by meta-module assignment. Heatmap shows effect sizes
  from differential module eigengene (DME) testing in early-stage AD, late-stage AD,
  and AD in DS compared with controls. Triangular heatmaps show measures of distance
  between modules (bottom left: Jaccard index, bottom right: odds ratio). b-d, Comparison
  of effect sizes from differential module eigengenes testing in early-stage AD and
  AD in DS (b), late-stage AD and AD in DS (c), and late-stage AD and early-stage
  AD (d). Each dot represents a gene co-expression module, and selected modules are
  labeled. Black line represents a linear regression with a 95% confidence interval
  shown in grey. Pearson correlation coefficients are shown in the upper left corner
  of each panel. e, Upset plot showing the overlap between sets of differentially
  expressed modules in each disease group. f, Spatial expression profiles (module
  eigengenes, MEs) of the 15 meta-modules in one representative sample. Darker color
  corresponds to higher expression levels. A spatial plot with each spot colored by
  cluster assignment is shown in the bottom right corner as a visual aid. g, UMAP
  feature plots showing MEs of the 15 spatial meta-modules projected into the snRNA-seq
  dataset. Darker color corresponds to higher expression levels. The UMAP plot colored
  by major cell type is shown in the bottom right corner as a visual aid. h, Selected
  pathway enrichment results for each meta-module. i, Heatmaps showing the meta-module
  DME results for each cortical layer and white matter in the early-stage AD (top),
  late-stage AD (middle), and AD in DS (bottom) samples compared to controls. DME
  tests were performed similarly to those shown in panel (a). X symbol indicates that
  the test did not reach statistical significance. j, Violin plots showing MEs of
  selected meta-modules (M1, M6, and M11) in the 5xFAD mouse dataset, split by age
  group, with black line indicating the median ME. k, Lollipop plot showing module
  preservation analysis of the meta-modules projected into the 5xFAD mouse dataset.
  Z-summary preservation > 10: highly preserved; 10 > Z-summary preservation > 2:
  moderately preserved; 2 > Z-summary preservation: not preserved'
