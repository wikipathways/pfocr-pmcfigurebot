caption: 'Hsp90 governs C. albicans filamentation through the unfolded protein response.
  Top left: Under basal conditions, Hsp90 and its cochaperone Sgt1 physically interact
  with Cyr1, keeping it in an inactive conformation, repressing the cAMP–PKA signaling
  cascade. Hsp90 also binds Hsf1, which represses Hsf1 function. Top right: Inhibition
  of the proteasome leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated, misfolded proteins
  that overwhelm the functional capacity of Hsp90, thereby relieving the repression
  on Hsf1 and the cAMP–PKA pathway, inducing the heat-shock response and filamentation,
  respectively. Bottom left: Depletion of HSF1 reduces HSP90 expression and function,
  relieving repression of the cAMP–PKA pathway, and enabling filamentation. Bottom
  right: Overexpression of HSF1 expands Hsf1 direct targets, which drives the overexpression
  of positive regulators of filamentation, including Brg1 and Ume6. Figure adapted
  from Ref. [].'
