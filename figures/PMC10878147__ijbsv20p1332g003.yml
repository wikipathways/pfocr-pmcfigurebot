caption: Illustration represents the polyphenols targeting the NF-κB pathway associated
  with SCI. SCI is characterized by primary injury followed by secondary injury. Increased
  intracellular calcium ion concentration, free radical production, blood-spinal cord
  barrier disruption, and mass ion reflux result from primary injuries, leading to
  the progression of secondary injuries. In addition, spinal ischemia, oxidative stress,
  and neuroinflammation lead to the progression of secondary SCI
