figure_title: Affinity purification in low-salt conditions suggested that Aac2pA128P
  accumulates along the carrier protein import pathway
caption: (A) Immunoblot analysis validating the HIS6-tagged Aac2p proteins. (B) Flow
  chart of label-free quantitative mass spectrometry data processing strategy. See
  Materials and methods for further details. (C) Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry
  demonstrated that Aac2pA128P-HIS6 was about half as abundant as Aac2p-HIS6 after
  total peptide normalization. This is consistent with immunoblot in (A) and underscores
  the need to normalize prey protein levels by bait (i.e. Aac2) protein levels. These
  data are from the low-salt experiment. (D) Three most significant Gene Ontology
  (GO) Molecular Function terms overrepresented among proteins that are significantly
  enriched in Aac2pA128P-HIS6 eluate in the low-salt experiment. (E) Seven most significant
  GO Biological Process terms overrepresented among proteins that are significantly
  enriched in Aac2pA128P-HIS6 eluate in the low-salt experiment. (F) Three most significant
  protein families overrepresented among proteins that are significantly enriched
  in Aac2pA128P-HIS6 eluate in the low-salt experiment, as determined from the Pfam
  database. (G) Immunoblot analysis validating preferential co-purification of Tim22p
  with Aac2pA128P-HIS6 compared with Aac2p-HIS6. (H) Quantitation from four independent
  affinity purifications followed by immunoblotting, as shown in (D). p-Value was
  calculated with Student’s t test. (I) The association of Aac2pA128P with Tim23p
  was not increased compared with wild-type in the low-salt experiment. These data
  are from label-free quantitative mass spectrometry of pull-down products. Data depicted
  as mean ± SEM. Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1.Uncropped Western blots
