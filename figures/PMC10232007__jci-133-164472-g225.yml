  TGF-β signaling pathway
caption: 'BMDM transfection with antagomir-21 or scramble control for 48 hours followed
  by TGF-β signaling pathway analysis. (A) TGF-β1 ELISA in culture media of BMDMs
  transfected with antagomir-21, mimic-21, or scramble control, stimulated with vehicle
  or LPS (100 ng/mL), n = 4 per group. (B) Immunofluorescent staining of TGF-βR2 in
  BMDMs transfected with antagomir-21 or scramble control. Bar graph represents quantification
  of TGF-βR2 fluorescence intensity (n = 4). Scale bar: 50 μm. (C) Immunofluorescent
  staining of p-SMAD2/3 in BMDMs transfected with antagomir-21 or scramble control.
  Bar graph represents quantification of p-SMAD2/3 fluorescence intensity (n = 9).
  Scale bar: 50 μm. (D) Western blotting of SMAD4 in BMDMs not transfected (lipofectamine,
  Lipo) and transfected with either antagomir-21 or scramble control, treated with
  vehicle or TGF-βR1 antagonist (SB431542), n = 4 per group. (E) Western blotting
  for p-ERK/ERK and p-p38/p38 in BMDMs not transfected and transfected with either
  antagomir-21 or scramble control, n = 4 per group. Data are presented as mean ±
  SEM. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison
  test (A and D) or unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s t test (B and C)'
