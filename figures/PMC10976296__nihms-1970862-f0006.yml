figure_title: Stunted Notch pathway in hippocampus of juvenile Alix−/− mouse
caption: '(A) WB analyses showing that, at P0 and P4, the levels of activated Notch1,
  activated Notch2, Notch1ICD, Notch2ICD, and Hes1 are similar in Alix+/+ and Alix−/−
  hippocampi. However, at P14, the levels of activated Notch1, activated Notch2, and
  Hes1 are significantly reduced in Alix−/− hippocampus.(B) Quantification of (A).
  n = 3 mice for each group. One-tailed Student’s t test, NS, not significant. P0:
  activated Notch1 p value = 0.3752, activated Notch2 p value = 0.3865, Notch1ICD
  p value = 0.2047, Notch2ICD p value = 0.3590, Hes1 p value = 0.1232. P4: activated
  Notch1 p value = 0.2149, activated Notch2 p value = 0.2743, Notch1ICD p value =
  0.3837, Notch2ICD p value = 0.4283, Hes1 p value = 0.0836. P14: activated Notch1
  *p value = 0.0324, activated Notch2 *p value = 0.0265, Notch1ICD p value = 0.1029,
  Notch2ICD p value = 0.4227, Hes1 **p value = 0.0042.(C) At P0 and P4, the expression
  patterns of Notch1ICD and Notch2ICD are similar in Alix+/+ and Alix−/− hippocampal
  CA1 regions. At P14, the amounts of nuclear-localized Notch1ICD and Notch2ICD are
  much less in Alix−/− hippocampal CA1 regions compared to Alix+/+ hippocampus. Scale
