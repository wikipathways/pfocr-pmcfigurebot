figure_title: (A) PPI network of core targets.
caption: (A) PPI network of core targets. (B) KEGG analysis, the size and color of
  a node are indicative of its degree in the network; nodes with a larger size and
  a deeper orange color represent targets with higher degrees. (C) The ombuin-targets-pathways
  network illustrates ombuin’s role in the treatment of neuroinflammation
