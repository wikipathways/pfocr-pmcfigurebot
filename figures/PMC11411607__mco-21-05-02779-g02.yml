caption: Regulation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways by andrographolide.
  Two different pathways, namely the canonical and non-canonical pathways, form the
  NF-κB signaling pathway. The canonical pathway begins at the cell membrane, where
  different stimuli bind to their corresponding receptors. This causes the activation
  of the IKK complex by Tak1. Subsequently, IκBα is phosphorylated in an IKK-mediated
  manner, and the phosphorylated IκBα is degraded by the proteasome. The degraded
  and phosphorylated IκBα then forms a heterodimer, RelA/p50, which leads to the nuclear
  translocation of this heterodimer and results in gene transcription. The non-canonical
  pathway begins with stimuli binding to a restricted set of cell surface receptors,
  namely TNF and B cell activating factor receptors, leading to the activation of
  IKKα by NIK. Subsequently, IKKα is phosphorylated and the RelB/p100 complex undergoes
  a partial proteolysis by the proteasome, which activates p52. RelB dimerizes with
  p52 and forms a heterodimer, which then translocates to the nucleus and causes gene
  transcription. Tak1, TGF-β activated kinase-1; IKK, IκB kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
