caption: 'Anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and their gene expression levels in Ph.nigra.
  (a) DEGs involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Blue and red in the heatmap represent
  the down- and up-regulated structural genes, respectively. Differentially expressed
  genes including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (C4H),
  4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamoyl-Co A reductase(CCR), chalcone synthase (CHS),
  chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase
  (F3′H), flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR),
  anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and UDP-glucose: flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltranferase
  (UFGT), O-methyltransferase (OMT). Four colored boxes show the relative gene expression
  level measured by RNA-seq (average value). (b) Relative expression of selected genes
  validated by qPCR. Error bars indicate standard deviation (SD) of three technical
  repeats'
