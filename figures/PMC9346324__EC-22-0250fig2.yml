caption: Overview of sphingolipid metabolism. Sphingolipid metabolism begins with
  a common entry point and exit via a single degradative pathway. SPT, serine palmitoyl
  transferase; KDHSR, ketodihydrosphingosine reductase; CERS, ceramide synthase; DES,
  dihydroceramide desaturase; SMase, sphingomylinease; SMS, sphingomyelin synthase;
  CK, ceramide kinase; C1PP, ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase; CDase, ceramidase;
  SK, sphingosine kinase; SPPase, sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase; SGPL1, sphingosine-1-phosphate
  lyase.
