caption: 'Lineage progression from an NPC to a myelinating OL and examples of key
  signaling pathways at each stage. (A): NPC. OPCs are specified from NPCs in the
  ventricular and subventricular zones. Reduction in NF1 leading to enhanced activation
  of Ras-Mapk-Erk1/2 pathway shifts the fate of NPCs to an OPC fate and suppresses
  the neuronal fate. Committed OPCs upregulate Olig2 and Sox10 which in turn turns
  on Pdgfra transcription. (B): OPC. OPC proliferation is dependent on PDGFRα and
  is mediated by PI-3K activating Akt and not through Mapk activating Erk1/2. (C):
  NFOL. In NFOLs, PI-3K activating Akt is primarily responsible for their terminal
  differentiation, survival, and initiation of myelination, possibly via the transcription
  factor FoxO1. HDAC1/2 activity, Myrf, and upregulation of Sox10, and Nkx2.2 are
  also critical for terminal differentiation. (D): mOL. In myelinating OLs (mOLs),
  activation of the Ras-Erk1/2 pathway is critical for maintaining myelination. NF1,
  neurofibromin; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; Erk1/2-P, phosphorylated Erk1/2; PDGF,
  platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFRα, platelet-derived growth factor receptor
  alpha; PI-3K, phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase; P-Akt, phospho-Akt; BDNF, brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; NFOL, newly formed OLs; HDAC1/2, histone deacetylase 1 and
  2; Myrf, myelin regulatory factor; NRG, neuregulin.'
