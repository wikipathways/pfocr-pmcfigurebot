figure_title: GLUT4 translocation through AD-36 and metformin.
caption: 'GLUT4 translocation through AD-36 and metformin. Insulin binding to its
  receptor activates a signaling pathway first regulated by a series of phosphorylation
  and then by adaptor protein recruitment; this pathway ultimately ends in GLUT4 translocation
  to cell membrane, which promotes glucose internalization. Abbreviations: IRS = insulin
  receptor substrate; PI3K = phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP2 = phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3 = phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate; PDK1 = phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1; Akt = protein kinase B; mTORC2 = mammalian target of rapamycin 2; AD-36
  = adenovirus-36; e4orf1 = E4 open reading frame 1; PPAR-g = peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ; GSV = GLUT4 storage vesicles; GLUT4 = glucotransporter 4; APS = adapter
  protein containing PH and SH2 domains; CAP = CBL-associated protein; c-CBL = cellular
  homolog of the transforming v-Cbl oncogene; CRK = adaptor protein CRK; C3G = guanine
  exchange factor C3G; TC10 = small GTP-binding protein TC10; Exo70 = subunit 70 of
  exocist complex. Modified from Sayem, 2018 [22]. (A). In vitro models have shown
  AD-36 interacts with insulin pathway and induces GLUT4 translocation through PPARγ
  upregulation, which favors GLUT4 transcription. Moreover, AD-36 E4orf1 gene also
  activates PI3K signaling and leads to GLUT4 translocation to cell membrane. (B).
  On the other hand, metformin intervenes in insulin signaling pathway in a different
  mechanism; it regulates CAP and c-CBL proteins and increases GLUT4 translocation
  from GSV to membrane'
