caption: Schematic representation of potential signalling Interactions among four
  key 16p11.2 CNV genes. MAPK3 (ERK1), TAOK2, KCDT13 and MVP may interact at the intracellular
  level in modulating neuroanatomical, synaptic and cognitive functions. Gene dosage
  alterations present in either 16p11.2 deletion or duplication syndromes could imbalance
  the coordinated cellular activities of these genes. Multiple receptor systems can
  activate the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 signalling pathway that controls both gene expression
  and chromatin remodelling. ERK1 (MAPK3) and ERK2 (MAPK1) also interact with the
  PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 pathway in modulating protein translation. One important aspect
  of MAPK3/MAPK1 signalling modulation is that MAPK3 gene dosage may shift the balance
  between the two kinase activities, resulting in different signalling intensities
  with consequences at the physio-pathological level. Major Vault Protein (MVP) may
  act as a scaffold protein for both ERK1/2 and mTORC1 signalling, thereby providing
  additional modulatory control. TAOK2 kinase stimulates multiple cytosolic and nuclear
  targets, including JNK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases that may interact with the ERK1/ERK2
  pathway and the RhoA-ROCK kinase cascade. The action of TAOK2 may inhibit synaptic
  maturation and protein translation, potentially in opposition to ERK1/2. KCDT13
  may facilitate RhoA degradation via CULLIN 3 (CUL3) interactions, also potentially
  antagonising some of TAOK2 functions. Figure has been created using Biorender.com.
