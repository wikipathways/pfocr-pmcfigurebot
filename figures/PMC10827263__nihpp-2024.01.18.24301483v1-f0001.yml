figure_title: JAK inhibition with daily ruxolitinib treatment in a mouse model of
  CM-PIIRS attenuates signs of disease and systemic inflammation
caption: |-
  a Graphical schema for mouse infection with 106
  Cryptococcus neoformans 52D (iv) and daily treatment with ruxolitinib (1 g/kg Nutragel diet). At 21 days post-infection (dpi), brain and spleen were harvested. b Heatmap showed top 30 upstream regulators identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of NanoString Neuroinflammation Panel gene expression data from whole brain compared to naïve mice (n=4 mice per group). Red regulators=JAK/STAT pathway specific, purple regulators=downstream of JAK/STAT pathway signaling. c Brain homogenates were harvested on 21 dpi for immunoblot analysis of phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701), total STAT1, phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), total STAT3, and β-actin as loading control. Top, representative protein immunoblot images; bottom, quantification of protein immunoblot data (n=4–8 mice per group; two experiments). D–h Brain weight (d; 21 dpi), brain fungal burden (e; 21 dpi), mouse weights (f; throughout infection), spleen size (g; 21 dpi), spleen weight (h; 21 dpi), and numbers of splenocytes were enumerated (i; 21 dpi). j Graphical schema for mouse infection with 106
  Cryptococcus neoformans 52D (iv) and delayed amphotericin B (5 mg/kg ip) and ruxolitinib (1 g/kg Nutragel diet) treatment. K–m Brain fungal burden (k; 21 dpi), mouse weights (l; throughout infection), and brain weight (m; 21 dpi) were enumerated as described in . Error bars indicate s.d., n = 8–20 mice per time point.
