figure_title: Designed scaffolds fall into Ang1‐ or Ang2‐like classes depending on
  valency
caption: 'ASchematic representation of the in vitro scratch cell migration/ wound‐healing
  assay.BIcos1 at 18 nM F‐domain stimulates cell migration relative to PBS/vehicle
  control. Scale bars are 100 µm.CComparison of cell migration induced by Ang1, Ang2,
  and designed F‐domain scaffolds after 12 h of treatment. The change in wound area
  was normalized to vehicle control. All experiments have at least three biological
  replicates. (*) is the comparison between F‐domain scaffolds vs. Ang1, and (#) is
  the comparison between F‐domain scaffolds vs. Vehicle. (####) indicated P < 0.0001.DSchematic
  of in vitro tube formation assay; designed F‐domain scaffolds were added at 90 nM
  F‐domain and removed after 24 h; vascular stability was analyzed at 48‐h and 72‐h
  timepoints.ERepresentative increase in vascular stability by Icos1. The number of
  nodes (blue), meshes (red), and tubes (green) was quantified using angiogenesis
  analyzer plug‐in in ImageJ. Scale bar is 100 µm.FEffect of F‐domain scaffolds on
  the vascular stability at 48‐ and 72‐h timepoints was assessed by taking the average
  of the number of nodes, meshes, and tubes and normalized to vehicle as log2 fold
  change. All experiments have at least three biological replicates except for Ang2
  at 48‐h timepoint and Ang2, Tet1, Tet2, akC4, and Icos2 at 72‐h timepoint in tube
  formation assay that have two biological replicates.GDesigned F‐domain scaffolds
  fall into Ang1‐ and Ang2‐like classes. Color indicates highest (1) to lowest (0)
  pAKT, pERK1/2, and pFAK levels which were column normalized. Cell migration level
  and vascular stability (48‐h timepoint) were also column normalized from highest
  to lowest. Data information: In C and F, the bars represent the mean ± SEM. One‐way
  ANOVA with Bonferroni test was used for multiple comparisons to calculate P‐values.
  P‐values are also indicated in Appendix Table .'
