caption: Schematic representation of involvement of substrates and products in both
  metabolic phases (acidogenesis and solventogenesis) of fermentation in C. acetobutylicum.
  (A) Acidogenesis contains one substrate (glucose) and three products (biomass, acetic
  acid, and butyric acid). (B) Solventogenesis phase incorporates three substrates
  (glucose, acetic acid, and butyric acid) and three products (acetone, butanol, and
  ethanol). Apart from biomass and metabolites, gases, viz. hydrogen and carbon dioxide
  are also evolved throughout the fermentation (not shown in figure). During model
  development, all intracellular steps of metabolic pathway were assumed in steady-state
  and only extracellular substrates and products were taken into account. The figure
  also shows rates of production regulated by control coefficients for acidogenesis
  (α1) and solventogenesis (α2). To simplify the complex metabolism of C. acetobutylicum,
  we have created a schematic representation that illustrates the two metabolic phases.
  In order to enhance clarity and readability, we have divided this representation
  into two separate figures
