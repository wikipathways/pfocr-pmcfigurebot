caption: Reactome pathway analysis. Reactome pathway analysis was conducted on a total
  824 genes using the DAVID functional annotation tool. Selection of pathways was
  carried out based on FDR (p â‰¤ 0.05) criteria. Pathways highlighted in grey represent
  those with a statistically significant differential gene expression (p < 0.05) between
  rNJ0612NME6 and rNJ0612NME6-M51R. Details about the levels of expression of specific
  genes within the relevant pathways are presented in Figure 4
