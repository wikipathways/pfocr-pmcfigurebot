  SA treatment.
caption: Defense responses of kiwifruit to Psa infection are strengthened by SA treatment.
  (A,B) Volcano plot shows the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in SAI24H
  vs. I24H (A) and SAI48H vs. I48H (B). (C,D) GO enrichment analysis of DEPs from
  SAI24H vs. I24H (C) and SAI48H vs. I48H (D). (E,F) The pathway enrichment analysis
  of DEPs from SAI24H vs. I24H (E) and SAI48H vs. I48H (F). The enriched pathways
  related to upregulated and downregulated DEPs are shown in red and purple, respectively.
  (G) Activation of resistance-related proteins in kiwifruit via Psa infection is
  promoted by SA treatment
