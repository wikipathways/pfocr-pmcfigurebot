figure_title: NR supplementation improves insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle cells.
caption: 'NR supplementation improves insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle cells.
  (A) Uptake of 2-NBDG by C2C12 myotube cells, the microscope magnification is 200×.
  (B) Relative mRNA expression of GLUT4 gene. (C) Representative Western blot results
  of insulin signaling pathway–associated protein (IRS1, AKT) of cells. β-Actin served
  as loading control. (D) Quantitative results for WB; n = 3 in each group. (E) Representative
  Western blot results and quantitative results for WB of AKT of skeletal muscle tissue
  of mice. β-Actin served as a loading control; n = 3 in each group. * p < 0.05 compared
  with the CON group; # p < 0.05 comparing PA group vs. PA + NR group. Abbreviations:
  2-NBDG—2-deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-amino]-D-glucose; GLUT4—glucose
  transporter type 4; IRS1—insulin receptor substrate 1; p-IRS1—phosphorated insulin
  receptor substrate 1; AKT—protein kinase B; p-AKT—phosphorated protein kinase B'
