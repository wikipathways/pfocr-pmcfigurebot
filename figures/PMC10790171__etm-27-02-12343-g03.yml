figure_title: PDCD4 knockdown inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress by blocking the
  MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.
caption: 'PDCD4 knockdown inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress by blocking the MAPK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. Protein expression levels of (A) ERK1/2, JNK, p38, NF-kBp65,
  p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, p-p38 and p-NF-kBp65, and (B) CHOP, GRP78, ATF4, eIF2α and p-eIF2α
  in KA-induced HT22 cells transfected with sh-PDCD4 with or without PMA treatment
  were detected by western blot analysis. Data are presented as the means ± SD. ***P<0.001
  vs. Control; ###P<0.001 vs. KA + sh-NC; $P<0.05 and $$$P<0.001 vs. KA + sh-PDCD4.
  ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; eIF2α,
  eukaryotic initiation factor-2α; GRP78, glucose-regulated protein 78; KA, kainic
  acid; NC, negative control; p-, phosphorylated; PDCD4, human programmed cell death
  4; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; sh, short hairpin'
