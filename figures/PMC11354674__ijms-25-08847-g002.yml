caption: (A) Organization of the NOC-IBR1 and NOC-IBR2 biosynthesis-related gene clusters
  from Nocardia sp. CS682DR; the translational directions of the genes are indicated
  by arrows, and the letters above the arrows represent the gene names. (B) Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway for compounds NOC-IBR1 and NOC-IBR2, where FnqE1/E2/E3 are
  acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), FnqI is a Bayerâ€“Villiger monooxygenase, and FnqA is
  an esterase. FnqGH = SnoaL-like domain protein and FAD oxidase; FnqJ = hydrolase.
  FnqBCD = ferredoxin, cytochrome P450, and flavin reductase, respectively; ThnM3
  = methyltransferase. fnqO in the orange frame is the SARP gene
