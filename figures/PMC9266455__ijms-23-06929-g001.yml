caption: 'Molecular regulatory networks underpinning plant HS response and HS memory.
  HS alters plasma membrane (PM) fluidity, thereby initiating a lipid signalling pathway
  and inducting Ca2+ channels. Other PM-embedded receptors, such as the CNGCs, RBOHs,
  etc., perceive HS signals. Elevated cytosolic Ca2+ ions evoke the Ca2+signalling
  pathways, mediated by the calmodulins (CaMs), CBKs or CDPKs (see text for details).
  The CaM interacts with CBK3 and CaM-binding protein phosphatase 7 (PP7) to activate
  HSFA1 by phosphorylation and enhanced regulation, respectively. The HSFA1 regulates
  the induction of several other HSFs, including HSFA2, dehydration-responsive element-binding
  2A (DREB2A), HSFA7s, and micro-RNAs (miRNAs, e.g., miR398) that initiate the expression
  of HSPs and other heat stress-inducible genes, which eventually orchestrates physiological
  responses precipitating thermotolerance acquisition. Meanwhile, the ROS (H2O2) sensed
  by the RBOHs, together with nitric oxide (NO) and metabolic H202 generated from
  chloroplasts, mitochondria, etc., trigger ROS build-up, which initiates the ROS
  signalling pathway, and ultimately alters the expression of HSPs and other HS-inducible
  genes, via the activation of monomeric HSFs (inactive form in the cytoplasm), which
  yield oligomeric HSFs (active form which is translocated into the nucleus) to activate
  HSP gene expression. The PM-sensed HS signals, or ROS burst emanating from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER)-generated HS also activate the cytoplasmic protein response (CPR)
  and unfolded protein response (UPR) mechanisms. The UPR network is largely mediated
  by the inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1)-bZIP60 mRNA and the site-1/site-2 proteases
  (S1P/S2P)-bZIP28 pathways. Upon ER stress, IRE1 catalyzes the splicing of the bZIP60
  mRNA into a truncated bZIP60 (s) variant that encodes a bZIP60 protein lacking a
  transmembrane domain, which allows for its translocation from the ER into the nucleus,
  where it will activate HS-responsive genes expression. Under benign conditions,
  BiP (an ER-embedded chaperone) maintains bZIP28 at the ER. However, ER stress causes
  the relocation of bZIP28 to the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes proteolytic
  processing, consequently triggering nuclear relocation of its cytoplasm-facing domain,
  where it ultimately evokes HS-responsive genes expression. Meanwhile, histone modification
  (HM) and chromatin remodelling (CR) also stimulate HS-inducible gene expression.
  In addition, HM, CR, ONSEN and some transposons modulate plant HS memory (HSM).
  Heat-intolerant 4 (HIT4) is a central regulator of CR in response to HS and facilitates
  nucleosome dispersion leading to the release of transcriptional gene silencing.
  HSFA2-derived HM offers transient HSM that lasts for a few days and facilitates
  rapid gene reactivation, whereas CR, ONSEN, and transposons-mediated HSM last for
  a longer period and provides long-term adaptation to plant HS. Note: Dashed lines
  and question marks signify links yet to be confirmed. Other abbreviations mentioned
