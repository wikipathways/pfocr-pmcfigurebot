figure_title: Tryptophan metabolites interact with AhR and potentially interfere with
  serotonin and melatonin synthesis.
caption: Tryptophan metabolites interact with AhR and potentially interfere with serotonin
  and melatonin synthesis. The essential amino acid tryptophan (Trp) can be transformed
  by different metabolic pathways. From left to right, it can be decarboxylated by
  the enzyme tryptophan decarboxylase, generating Tryptamine, which is oxidated by
  the monoamine oxidase (MAO) or by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/UVA/UVB to Indole-3-acetaldehyde
  (I3A). From Trp, an aminotransferase generates Indole-3-pyruvic acid (I3P), which
  is transformed by Indolepyruvate decarboxylase (I3PD) in Indole-3-acetaldehyde (I3A).
  Then, the condensation of I3A generates 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), the
  best endogenous agonist of AhR. The right side of the figure shows the reaction
  that, starting from Trp, is catalyzed by the two enzymes tryptophan/Indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (TDO/IDO). The product is Formyl Kynurenine, the substrate transformed
  by the enzyme N’-Formylkinurenine formamidase in Kynurenine, another endogenous
  agonist of AhR. Finally, the hydroxylation of Trp by tryptophan hydroxylase generates
  5-hydroxytryptophan, which is decarboxylated by tryptophan decarboxylase in 5-hydroxytryptamine,
  aka Serotonin. The aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) transforms Serotonin
  in N-acetyl serotonin (NAS), which is finally transformed by Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase
  (ASMT) in N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, aka Melatonin. Melatonin activates AhR,
  which induces CYP1A1, while FICZ-activated AhR induces the expression of CYP1A1/A2/B1.
