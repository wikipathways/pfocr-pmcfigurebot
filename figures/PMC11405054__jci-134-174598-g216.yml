figure_title: EGCG inhibits TGF-β1 pathway activity in fibroblasts from ILD biopsies
  and identifies sFRP2 as a downstream target gene
caption: (A) Dimensional reduction plot of subsetted and reclustered alveolar (red)
  and pathologic (blue) (CTHRC1+, inflammatory, and HAS1+/BMP antagonist+) fibroblast
  subtypes from untreated biopsy (5,225 cells, n = 3) and EGCG biopsy (6,773 cells,
  n = 4) samples. (B) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in alveolar and
  pathologic fibroblast subtypes from EGCG biopsy versus untreated biopsy samples,
  with selected TGF-β pathway genes labeled, including sFRP2. (C) Heatmap of z scores
  from IPA upstream pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in alveolar
  and pathologic fibroblast subtypes from EGCG biopsy versus untreated biopsy samples.
  (D) Violin plots of selected TGF-β pathway genes split by individual biopsy sample
