figure_title: 5-Aza ameliorated the downregulation of ALDH expression and β-alanine
  biosynthesis by OS.
caption: 5-Aza ameliorated the downregulation of ALDH expression and β-alanine biosynthesis
  by OS. (A) Webster's chart of gene expression difference. (B) 944 probes selected
  from (A) were subjected to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. 35 pathways were presented.
  (C) Schematic diagram illustrating the role of ALDH2, ALDH3A1, and ALDH6A1 in β-alanine
  metabolic pathway. (D-E) HUVECs were pretreated with DMSO or 5-Aza (10 μmol/L) for
  24 hours, exposed to PS or OS for 24 hours, and the protein and mRNA expressions
  of ALDH2, ALDH3A1 and ALDH6A1 were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR (D) and Western
  blotting (E). Data were presented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey's multiple comparisons test, n = 5-8. (F-G) HUVECs were pretreated with
  DMSO or 5-Aza (10 μmol/L) for 24 hours, exposed to PS or OS for 24 hours, carnosine
  content (F) and acetyl-CoA content (G) were measured by ELISA kit. Data were presented
  as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons
  test, n = 5 or 6
