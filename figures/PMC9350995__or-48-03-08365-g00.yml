caption: Glucose is transferred from extracellular to intracellular space under the
  mediation of GLUT. Subsequently, glucose is catalyzed by glycolytic enzymes in the
  cytoplasm to pyruvate, which is normally transferred to the mitochondria to enter
  the TCA. However, in hypoxic environments or when tumor cells exert the Warburg
  effect, pyruvate is catalyzed by LDH to produce lactate. This energy pathway change
  provides certain advantages for the occurrence and development of tumors. GLUT,
  glucose transporter; HK, hexokinase; FK1, phosphofructokinase 1; PGK, phosphoglycerate
  kinase; PK, pyruvate kinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle.
