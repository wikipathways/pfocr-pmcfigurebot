caption: The changes in the expression of key proteins of NF-κB and MAPK signaling
  pathway after LPS stimulation in RECs at different times. (A) The WB results of
  TLR4, Myd88, P-NF-κB p65, NF-κB p65, P-IκBα, IκBα, P-JNK, JNK, P-ERK, ERK, P-p38
  MAPK, p38 MAPK and β-actin; (B–H) The gray analysis of TLR4, Myd88, P-NF-κB p65,
  P-IκBα, JNK, ERK and p38 MAPK. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, * was compared to 0 h group.
  N = 5 in each group
