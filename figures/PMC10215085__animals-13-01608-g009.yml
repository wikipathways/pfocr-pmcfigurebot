caption: The hypothetical molecular mechanism model was developed for the influence
  of starch on the growth and proliferation of B. coli. This model includes starch
  hydrolysis, glycolysis, activation of the cAMP/PCA signaling pathway, the cell cycle,
  and autophagy of cells in B. coli. The red and green colors represent the genes
  with upregulated and downregulated expression in the related pathway, respectively
