figure_title: Notch signaling pathway.
caption: Notch signaling pathway. Upon the binding of canonical ligands to the receptor,
  proteolytic cleavage is triggered by the γ—secretase complex (comprising presenilin,
  nicastrin, APH1, and PEN2 proteins) within the receptor’s intracellular domain (NICD).
  This process exposes nuclear localization sequences, enabling the NICD to translocate
  to the nucleus. Upon coupling with proteins from the CSL (CBF1/RBPJ—kappa/Su (H)/Lag1)
  family, NICD acts as a transcriptional coactivator for genes belonging to the hairy
  and enhancer of split 1 (HES1), HES1—related (HESR1), SOX9, P21, C—Myc, and cyclin
  D1 families, which are involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and
  apoptosis processes. DLK1—delta-like non-canonical Notch ligand 1; DLK2—delta-like
  non—canonical Notch ligand 2/EGFL9—EGF-like domain-containing protein 9; EGFL7—EGF—like
  domain-containing protein 7; DNER—delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor (EGF)—related
  receptor; NICD—Notch intracellular domain; PEN2—presenilin 2; APH—anterior pharynx—defective;
  Lag1—longevity assurance gene 1; CBF1/RBPJ—kappa—C—repeat/DRE binding factor 1/recombination
  signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region
