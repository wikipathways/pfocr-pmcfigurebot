caption: Drosophila egg chamber organisation and oocyte nucleus positioning from stage
  1 to 7. (A) Reconstitution of an ovariole from different ovarian follicles from
  stage 1 to stage 7. The nuclei are visualized by the expression of the Drosophila
  importin-Î² i. e Female sterile (2) Ketel protein coupled to GFP (Fs(2)Ket-GFP) (green)
  and cell membranes by the ubiquitous expression of the pleckstrin homology (PH)
  domain of the Phospholipase C protein coupled to RFP (ubi-PH-RFP) (red) (scale bar
  10 microns). (B) Close-up of the nucleus in the oocyte, illustrating the evolution
  of nuclear positioning in the oocyte from stage 2 to stage 7 (scale bar 10 microns).
  (C) Schematic representation of the internal nuclear organisation adapted from [4].
  At stages 2 to 4, the chromosomes reorganise to form a compact structure of condensed
  inactive chromatin called the karyosome. [5,6]. From stage 5 to 6, the euchromatic
  synaptonemal complex is disassembled. At stage 7, the synaptonemal complex persists
  at the centromeres. (D) Schematic representation of a stage 6 ovarian follicle.
  The posterior follicles cells (dark brown) in contact with the plasma membrane at
  the posterior of the oocyte (blue dotted line) send a signal (black arrows) to the
  oocyte, which eventually leads to the migration of the nucleus (B) and the reorganisation
  of the microtubule networks. (E) Schematic representation of a stage 7 ovarian follicle.
  The nucleus has migrated to the intersection of the anterior and posterior plasma
  membranes of the oocyte. This position will define the dorsal pole of the oocyte.
  The nucleus is associated with grk mRNA, which is translated and secreted locally.
  This creates an activation gradient for the EGF signalling pathway, which is responsible
  for establishing the dorsoventral polarity of the ovarian follicle [7] and the future
  embryo [8]
