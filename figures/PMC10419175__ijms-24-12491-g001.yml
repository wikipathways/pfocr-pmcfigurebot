caption: A unified framework that overviews the current knowledge of how mechanically,
  biochemically (Hippo), and pharmacologically regulated YAP activities contribute
  to drug resistance in cancer cells. Gray ellipses represent the input signals from
  mechanical (as detailed in Section 2), biochemical (Hippo), and pharmacological
  (as detailed in Section 3) upstream regulators of YAP. Blue arrows indicate whether
  the activation/inhibition of the upstream regulators will induce YAP nuclear translocation.
  Activation of mechanical stimuli (except nuclear mechanical properties) and pharmacological
  treatment upregulates YAP nuclear translocation. While inhibition of Hippo pathway
  upregulates YAP nuclear translocation. Black arrows show the corresponding YAP-regulatory
  pathways with the key molecular/cellular mediators listed in blue ellipses. Green
  ellipses represent the resulting YAP nuclear translocation for each pathway with
  the corresponding phosphorylation sites of YAP. In the Hippo pathway, YAP-S127 dephosphorylation
  is denoted as “−” (i.e., dephosphorylation). Green arrows show the current knowledge
  of the crosstalk between the inputs and key mediators (as detailed in Section 4
  and Section 5). The crosstalk network indicates the potential targets of (1) inhibiting
  the mechanical regulators of YAP or (2) suppressing the drug-treatment-induced activation
  of mechanotransduction events to eventually reduce drug resistance (as detailed
  in Section 5)
