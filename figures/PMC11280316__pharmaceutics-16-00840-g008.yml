caption: 'Suggested schematic illustration of the mechanism by which crocin could
  induce cell survival and exert anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in stressed
  cardiomyocytes. In response to the treatment of AAPH and H2O2, crocin represents
  antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties through activation of Nrf2 and inhibition
  of NF-κB, respectively. Activation of Nrf2 is required for the cellular antioxidant
  activity of crocin. In response to the AAPH-induced stress, crocin acts as a free
  radical scavenger, and it somehow modulates Nrf2/HO1/NQO1 expression. Inhibition
  of NF-κB, either through TLR4 and MYD88 or other related signaling, decreases transcription
  of pro-inflammatory genes and miR-21 and overall declines inflammation. Moreover,
  crocin hinders PTEN from surviving cells against oxidative stress. A decreased level
  of PTEN significantly induces AKT expression at both transcriptional and translational
  levels, which stimulates mTOR signaling and leads to cell proliferation and survival.
  Moreover, crocin induces anti-apoptotic factors to block mitochondrial-induced cell
  apoptosis. Since AAPH induces ROS in the cell membrane and cytoplasm but not directly
  in mitochondria, the molecular signaling pathway induced by AAPH may be different
  from H2O2; therefore, it is rational to observe differences in gene expression levels
  in response to crocin treatment in AAPH and H2O2-induced stressed-out cardiomyocytes
  (see text). mTOR: protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin, TLR4: tool-like
  receptor 4, Nrf-2: nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2, HO-1: heme oxygenase-1,
  NQO1: NAD quinone oxidoreductase 1, ROS: reactive oxygen species'
