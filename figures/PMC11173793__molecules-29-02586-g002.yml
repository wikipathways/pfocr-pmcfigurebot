caption: Effect of temperature and carbon source on the whole-cell catalytic synthesis
  of baccatin III. (A) Effect of temperature on the whole-cell catalytic. (B) Effect
  of carbon source type on the whole-cell catalytic. (C) Effect of carbon source concentration
  on the whole-cell catalytic. (D) Metabolic pathway for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA
  from representative carbon sources. (E) Effect of different carbon sources on strain
  growth. ** represents significant differences at the p < 0.01 level
