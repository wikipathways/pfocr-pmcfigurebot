figure_title: Reconstruction of the p-CA synthesis pathway in S.
caption: Reconstruction of the p-CA synthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae. (a) Integration
  mapping of FjTAL, AtPAL2, AtC4H, AtATR2, and CYB5 to the S. cerevisiae genome. (b)
  HPLC profiles of p-CA-producing strains, p-CA standard, and cinnamic acid standard.
  (c) p-CA production, as well as OD600 readings, of strains SQ01-SQ05. Statistically
  significant differences between two data groups were determined using a two-tailed
  Studentâ€™s t-test (one-tailed; two-sample unequal variance; **** p < 0.0001). All
  data represent the mean of n = three biologically independent samples, and error
  bars show standard deviation
