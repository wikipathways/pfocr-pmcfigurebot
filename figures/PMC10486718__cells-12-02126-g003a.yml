caption: Diagram illustrating the androgen-mediated signal transduction via integrins
  and the resulting biological activities. (A) Integrin-induced cell motility and
  adhesion are mediated by AR. Activation of iAR by DHT or R1881 affects different
  subtypes of integrin expression to regulate cell adhesion and motility. RANK/RANKL
  promotes iAR expression through integrin α2β1 and induces integrin α2β1-involved
  cell adhesion via FAK/Akt signaling pathway. In AR-expressing cells, FAK signaling
  modulates integrin α5β1-induced cell adhesion and integrin αv-induced cell motility.
  (B) Integrin-induced cell growth and survival are mediated by AR. Activation of
  iAR by R1881 induces the expression of integrin α6β1, which in turn regulates cell
  survival through HIF-1α-promoted BNIP3 expression. Furthermore, iAR activity is
  up-regulated by integrin αvβ6, leading to increased survivin expression and enhanced
  cell growth. The activation of IGF-IR suppresses the degradation of integrin α5β1
  through endocytosis, allowing this remaining integrin α5β1 to induce cell growth.
  The brown arrows indicate RANK/integrin α2β1/ transcription factor (TF)/iAR and
  RANK/integrin α2β1/FAK/Akt pathways; The dark blue arrows indicate integrin α5β1/FAK/Akt
  pathway; The purple arrows indicate integrin αv/FAK/mTOR pathway; The light blue
  arrows indicate IGF-1R/ integrin α5β1 pathway; The red arrows indicate R1881/iAR/integrin
  α6β1 pathway; The green arrows indicate integrin αvβ6/JNK/iAR (activity)/survivin
  pathway; The orange arrows indicate integrin α6β1/HIF-1α/BNIP3 pathway
