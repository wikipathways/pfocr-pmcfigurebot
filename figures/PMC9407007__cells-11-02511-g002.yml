caption: 'The LSECs’ anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory profiles during the progression
  of NAFLDAt the early stage of NAFLD, LSECs display an anti-inflammatory function
  characterized by a reduced expression of chemokines such as CCL2, CXCL10, and CXCL16
  through MAPK signaling and an induced expression of IL-10 by Th1 cells through the
  activation of Notch signaling. The activation of Notch signaling manifests anti-inflammatory
  effects through the induction of eNOS/sGC levels.During the progression of NAFLD
  from simple steatosis to NASH and cirrhosis, LSECs exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype
  mediated mostly through the activation of the NF-kB pathway. NF-kB regulates the
  expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, and VAP-1) as well
  as the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6). The secretion
  of inflammatory mediators is also regulated by TLRs and NO bioavailability. Elevated
  expression of adhesion molecules leads to induced leukocyte recruitment and their
  translocation into the hepatic parenchyma. On the other hand, increased expression
  of inflammatory mediators along with LSEC dysfunction stimulates the activation
  of KCs and leukocyte chemoattraction. The impaired LSEC autophagy observed during
  the progression of NAFLD also leads to the upregulation of adhesion molecule and
  chemokine expression, enhancing the inflammatory response. Reduced eNOS and increased
  iNOS contribute to the development of inflammation, the activation of KCs, and the
  recruitment of bone-marrow-derived macrophages. Abbreviations: ICAM-1: Intercellular
