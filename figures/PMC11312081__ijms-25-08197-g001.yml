figure_title: Differentiated hiPSC-CMs show core elements of the insulin signaling
  pathway.
caption: 'Differentiated hiPSC-CMs show core elements of the insulin signaling pathway.
  (a) Schematic representation of the differentiation protocol. Cells were differentiated
  with standard protocol, and then, from days 11 to 14, incubated with lactate medium
  before the experiments. Bright field acquisitions of undifferentiated (left) and
  differentiated (right) cells (20×, scale bar 5 µm). Bar graph and representative
  blots of lactate-purified hiPSC-CMs treated or not with insulin (INS, 100 nM, 30
  min) showing (b,c) pAKT/AKT (CTRL: 100.00; INS: 136.86 ± 9.80) and (d,e) pAS160/AS160
  (CTRL: 100.00; INS: 137.93 ± 8.12). n = 3 independent experiments, * p < 0.05; **
  p < 0.01'
