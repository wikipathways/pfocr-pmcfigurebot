figure_title: Endothelial to hepatic intercellular signal communication supports HLBO
  functionalization
caption: 'a) The heatmap showing cytokines and growth factors associated gene set
  derived from GO class: ‘GO_SIGNALING_RECEPTOR_BINDING’.b) The chord diagram showing
  the intercellular communication network within the HLBO and the number of significant
  ligand-receptor pairs by the thickness of their edges (p<0.05).c) The heatmap visualizing
  the relative importance of each cell type of HLBO based on the centrality score
  of WNT signaling pathway.d) The chord diagram describing significant ligand-receptor
  pairs involved WNT signaling within HLBO (p<0.05). The ligand and receptor names
  that overlap with intercellular communication in fetal liver are highlighted.e)
  Whole-mount image of siRNA-treated HLBOs with immunofluorescent staining for GS
  and ASGR1. Scale bar indicates 500 µm.f) Quantification of the percentage of cells
  expressing GS or ASGR1 in 3D reconstructed images. Total cell numbers were counted
  by counterstaining (DAPI). Data represent the mean ± SEM (n=6; **, p<0.01; ***,
  p<0.001; Mann-Whitney’s U-test).g) Whole-mount image of siRNA-treated HLBOs with
  immunofluorescent staining for CD32b and CD31.h) Quantification of vascular density
  (% area of vessels) and ratio of CD32b+ / CD31+ area. Data represent the mean ±
  SEM (n=9; *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; ***, p<0.001; ****, p<0.0001; one-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).i) Measurements of FVIII in HLBO supernatants.
  Data represent the mean ± SEM (n=5–12; *, p<0.05; ***, p<0.001; one-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s multiple comparisons test)'
