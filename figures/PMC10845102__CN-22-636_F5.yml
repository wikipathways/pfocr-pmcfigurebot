figure_title: Molecular mechanisms of classic psychedelics.
caption: Molecular mechanisms of classic psychedelics. Serotonergic psychedelics activate
  5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptors, causing glutamate release and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid (AMPA) potentiation. The resulting release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF) activates tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptors, ultimately resulting
  in activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling
  pathway and increasing expression of synaptic proteins [530]. Classic psychedelics
  also bind to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 5-HT2A receptors on the post-synaptic
  cell, activating downstream cascades. One of these cascades is the Gq-mediated response
  pathway, leading to production of phospholipase C (PLCÎ²) that catalyzes the production
  of second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG),
  in turn activating protein kinase C (PKC) and then extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) to mobilize intracellular calcium and, eventually, changes in
  gene expression. This and other intracellular pathways are part of the pro-neuroplastic
  effects of classic psychedelics [531]
