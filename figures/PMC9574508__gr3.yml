caption: General scheme proposed for rhamnan biosynthesis involving an ABC transporter–dependent
  pathway. The gene names refer to Lactococcus lactis, but this scheme is generally
  conserved for all rhamnan chains. Synthesis is initiated at the cytoplasmic side
  of the membrane, by the transfer of GlcNAc-P onto C55-P by a phosphoglycosyltransferase
  (TagO). The enzymes RmlA, B, C, and D are involved in synthesis of the rhamnose
  precursor dTDP-L-Rha. The rhamnosyltransferase RgpA transfers the first rhamnosyl
  residue onto the C55-PP-GlcNAc lipid intermediate acceptor and the chain is further
  elongated by two other rhamnosyltransferases, RgpB and RgpF. Chain polymerization
  is possibly terminated by the addition of a sugar (GlcNAc residue in L. lactis)
  by RgpE. The ABC transporter (comprising RgpC and RgpD) catalyzes the transfer of
  rhamnan chains to the outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane. Following export,
  rhamnan is most probably anchored covalently to peptidoglycan acceptor sites via
  a phosphodiester linkage to MurNAc (or GlcNAc) residues of the glycan chains, by
  an LCP transferase (LcpA in L. lactis). On the right side is represented the GT-C–fold
  glycosyltransferase (WpsJ) involved in side-chain addition onto rhamnan (detailed
  in ). LCP, LytR-CpsA-Psr.
