  disease, cytoskeleton regulation by GTPase Rho, and glycolysis.
caption: ICRP has peptides involved in the processes of inflammation mediated by cytokines
  and chemokines, Huntington’s disease, integrin signaling pathway, Parkinson’s disease,
  cytoskeleton regulation by GTPase Rho, and glycolysis. ICRP peptide content was
  entered into the Panther 17.0 ontology software with default values for predictions
  in Homo sapiens considering the Bos taurus proteomic origin. (a) Pathways induced
  based on gene percentage related to process (blue bars), in contrast with Homo sapiens
  reference lists per pathway (red bars). (b) Logarithmic fractional difference between
  observed and expected results
