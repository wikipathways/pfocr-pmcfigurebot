caption: Metabolite profiles of breast milk and different infant formulae. (a) Inter-group
  PLSDA (Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis). Variation contribution of each
  component was presented. (b) A hierarchical clustered heatmap of different metabolites
  identified by ANOVA analysis. (c) Venn plot of enriched pathways of differential
  metabolites of BM, PMF1, PMF2, and PMF3. (d) KEGG pathways enriched from differential
  metabolites of BM, PMF1, PMF2, and PMF3. Pathways satisfying p value < 0.1 were
  presented. (e) KEGG pathways enriched from differential metabolites of different
  breast milk groups. Pathways satisfying p value < 0.1 were presented
