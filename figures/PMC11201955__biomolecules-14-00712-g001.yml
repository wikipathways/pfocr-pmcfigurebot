  engineering in this study. Genes encoding enzymes in blue were inserted into the
  yeast. Enzymes encoded by red genes were inhibited using the antibiotic cerulenin.

  A; fabB/fabF/fabH, genes that encode the 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I/II; MatB, malonyl-CoA
  synthetase; MatC, malonate carrier protein; STS, stilbene synthase; TAL, tyrosine
