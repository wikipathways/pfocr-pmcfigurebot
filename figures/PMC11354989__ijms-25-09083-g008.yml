caption: ASFV replication could be inhibited by the knockdown of PRLR expression via
  regulating the JAK2 signaling pathway. (A,B) MA-104 cells were transfected with
  siRNA negative control (si-NC), siRNAs targeting PRLR (si-PRLR), and ANO3 (si-ANO3)
  for 24 h, respectively. The mRNA levels of PRLR (A) and ANO3 (B) were detected by
  RT-qPCR. (C–G) MA-104 cells were transfected with si-NC, si-PRLR-1502, and si-ANO3-362
  for 24 h, respectively. Then, the cells were infected with ASFVGZ for 24 h. The
  mRNA levels of B646L (C) and CP204L (D) were detected by RT-qPCR. The protein levels
  of p72 and p30 were detected by Western blot (E). The viral gene A137R copies were
  determined by qPCR (F), and the protein level of pJAK2 (G) was detected by Western
  blot. (H) Western blotting of ASFV-infected MA-104 cells treated with either 20
  or 40 μM ALO; samples were collected at 24 hpi. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001, and ns p > 0.05, compared to the DMSO control, respectively
