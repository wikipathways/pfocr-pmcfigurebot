caption: Mitogen‐activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) expression during the development
  of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (a) Schematic diagram showing subcutaneous
  injection of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells (5 × 105) into the right flanks of
  wild‐type (WT) mice. (b) Tumor volume. (c) Tumor weight. (d) Tumor pathology was
  analyzed by hematoxylin‐eosin (H&E) staining. (e) The expression levels of MAPK4
  in tumors was analyzed by immunofluorescence and (f) quantified. (g) The colocalization
  of CD34 and MAPK4 in tumors were analyzed by immunofluorescence. (h) Colocation
  coefficient between CD34 and MAPK4 expression were quantified by ImageJ. Representative
  data from three independent experiments were shown. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. NS, no
  significance.
