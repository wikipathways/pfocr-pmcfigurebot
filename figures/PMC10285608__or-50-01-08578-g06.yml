figure_title: PC cells downregulate lipid metabolism in cocultured adipocytes.
caption: PC cells downregulate lipid metabolism in cocultured adipocytes. LD levels
  in adipocytes cultured alone or cocultured with PC cells, (A) shown after staining
  with BODIPY, the size of LDs in cocultured adipocytes decreased, or (B) by measure
  of TG content, the content of TG in cocultured adipocytes decreased. (C) Top metabolic
  pathways from GSEA of downregulated genes in adipocytes cocultured with Panc-1 cancer
  cells (n=3) using GSEA Hallmark and GO biological process MSigDB database. (D) Gene
  Set Enrichment Analysis plot of enrichment in ‘Hallkmark_Adipogenesis’ signature
  in adipocytes cocultured/alone as described in (C). (E) Reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR analysis of adipogenesis upstream genes in adipocytes under the indicated conditions.
  Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. PC, pancreatic
  cancer; LD, lipid droplet; TG, triglyceride; FDRq, false discovery rate, q value
