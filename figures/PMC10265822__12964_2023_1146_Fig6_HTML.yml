caption: E70 of the CC-SAM domain of KSR1 plays a key role in its heterodimerization
  with BRAF. A Scheme of N-terminally Myc-tagged KSR1-SmBiT illustrating the localization
  of evolutionary conserved KSR1 PPI motifs tested in this study. The left alignment
  block shows the αC3-helix of the CC-SAM domain containing E70 forming a salt-bridge
  with BRAF [], and I71 and L78 involved in membrane recruitment []. The middle block
  shows the highly conserved DIF core with the R615H mutation. The right block portrays
  the C-terminal mode I 14–3-3 binding motif. Mutated residues are shown in red and
  the individual amino acid substitutions are indicated. Residues differing from the
  reference (mKSR1) are highlighted in blue. B HEK293T cells were transfected with
  the indicated plasmid combinations and treated with 10 μM Sorafenib or DMSO for
  4 h. Shown is the mean of four to seven biological replicates. C Expression vectors
  for the indicated Myc-tagged KSR1-SmBiT proteins and HA-tagged BRAFWT-LgBiT were
  co-transfected into HEK293T cells with either empty pMIG (-) or pMIG/KRASG12V ( +).
  KSR1-SmBiT fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody. Cells
  transfected with empty vectors or either pBRAFWT-LgBiT or pKSRWT-SmBiT serve as
  controls. Following Western blotting, IPs and TCLs were probed with the indicated
  antibodies to detect the specific interaction between KSR and BRAF and to confirm
  successful expression and pathway induction by KRASG12V. Shown is a single experiment
  with this plasmid combination. The effect of the E70K mutation, however, was also
  observed in a similar experimental set-up involving the BRAF-SmBiT/KSR1-LgBiT combination
