caption: Comparative signaling pathways of IL-6, PAI-1 and MCP-1. IL-6, PAI-1 and
  MCP-1 bind to IL-6R/sIL-6R, LRP and CCR2, respectively. Subsequently, JAK2 phosphorylates
  two STAT3 molecules, resulting in STAT3 dimerization, DNA binding and transcription
  of target genes. For instance, in the IL-6 signaling pathway, this leads to SOCS3
  induction which enacts a negative feedback on JAK2/STAT3 signaling. The interaction
  of IL-6 with IL-6R/sIL-6R activates PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways that induce JNK,
  PTP1B and SOCS3, thus promoting inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance
  and vascular disorder (green). The PAI-1 signaling pathway contributes to insulin
  resistance and suppresses adipogenesis (purple). Via the MCP-1 signaling pathway,
  the dimerized STAT3 activates G proteins, subsequently triggering PI3K/Akt, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  and adenylyl cyclase (AC) pathways. This causes macrophage infiltration and insulin
  resistance (orange)
