caption: 'Loss of looping events after ICG-001 treatment in pancreatic cancer cells.
  (A) Loss of looping events of insulin signaling genes in PANC1 and PATC53. Loop:
  with looping events. None: without looping events. (B) Expression of genes with
  loss of looping events in insulin signaling pathway in PANC1 and PATC53. Red up
  arrow: up-regulated genes. Green down arrow: down-regulated genes. (C) The relative
  interaction frequencies of insulin signaling pathway genes in PANC1, identified
  by 3C-qPCR experiments. * and **: samples t-test, *: p < 0.1, **: p < 0.05. (D)
  The relative interaction frequencies of insulin signaling pathway genes in PATC53,
  identified by 3C-qPCR experiments. * and **: samples t-test, *: p < 0.1, **: p <
  0.05. (E) Changes in TADs and looping events after ICG-001 treatment in PANC1 and
  PATC53. Up panel: TADs changes indicated by arrows. Down panel: looping events indicated
  by arcs. IRS1 gene body is highlighted with yellow. IRS1 30–130 K upstream to TSS
  is highlighted with blue.'
