figure_title: Correlation of TLE4 expression with immune cell infiltration in PTC.
caption: Correlation of TLE4 expression with immune cell infiltration in PTC. A. Analysis
  of the TIMER2.0 database illustrating a strong positive correlation between TLE4
  expression levels and the infiltration of various immune cells, including eosinophils,
  T helper cells, and Th1 cells, while showing a negative correlation with plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells in the PTC tumor microenvironment. B. Stratification of 512 PTC
  samples from the TCGA-THCA dataset into high and low TLE4 expression groups, demonstrating
  significant differences in immune cell infiltration patterns, as analyzed using
  the R package xCell. C. Single-gene differential expression analysis between high
  and low TLE4 expression groups in PTC, employing strict selection criteria (|log2FC|
  > 1) to identify significantly altered genes. D. GO functional enrichment analysis
  revealing TLE4's significant association with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, receptor
  signaling via STAT, and cytokine interactions
