caption: Apoptosis signaling pathway. Upon stimulation, the A549 cells activate p53,
  which translocates into the nuclei and triggers various reactions and cellular processes,
  including growth. This p53 activation leads to the upregulation of the proapoptotic
  protein Bax, and downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Subsequently,
  cytochrome c is released, which triggers caspase 3 production, finally leading to
  apoptosis
