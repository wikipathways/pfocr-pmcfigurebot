figure_title: GSK503 inhibits TIGIT ligand CD155 expression on OPM-2 cell surfaces
  by inhibiting mTOR signaling pathway.
caption: 'GSK503 inhibits TIGIT ligand CD155 expression on OPM-2 cell surfaces by
  inhibiting mTOR signaling pathway. OPM-2 cell line treated with 10 µL GSK503: (A)
  qRT-PCR showed that the relative expression of CD155 decreased, treated with GSK503
  (10 uM) after 72 h. (B) CD155 expression by flow cytometry, treated with GSK503
  for 72 h. (C) CD155 expression gradually decreased with increasing concentration
  of GSK503 in a concentration-dependent manner. (D) Expression changes of TIGIT ligands
  CD112 and CD113 on the surface of OPM-2 cells treated with GSK503(10 uM) after 72
  h. OPM-2 cells were treated with GSK503 (10 uM) for 72 h and expression changes
  of TIGIT ligands CD112 and CD113 on the surface of OPM-2 cells were detected by
  flow cytometry. (E) RNA sequencing GO analysis. (F) RNA sequencing KEGG analysis.
  The red rectangle refer to the mTOR signaling pathway that is chosen as the object
  of study. (G,H) After 10 µL GSK503 treatment of OPM-2 cells for 72 h, (H) Western
  blot and (I) grayscale analysis detected phosphorylated mTOR protein expression.
  (I) CD155 expression by flow cytometry, treated with Rapamycin for 72 h. (J) CD155
  expression gradually decreased with increasing Rapamycin concentration in a concentration-dependent
  manner. (B,D,I) are representative flow cytometry plot results from three independent
  replicate experiments. Figure S2 shows the gating strategy for flow cytometry. The
  results are presented as expression percentage and the experimental data are shown
  in Table S1. (A,C,H,J) used paired t-tests. p value < 0.05 was considered significant.
