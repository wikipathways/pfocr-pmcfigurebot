caption: (A) The radar plot shows the distribution of Spearman correlation between
  M1-type macrophage infiltration and GBP5 expression in tumor types calculated by
  three distinct algorithms. The number of samples in specific cancer group was signed
  by “N”. The skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) was departed into primary (SKCM-P) and
  metastatic (SKCM-M) and showed in the radar plot. (B) qRT-PCR test showed the transcription
  level of M1 macrophage markers in cocultured Mø. “*” stands for p-Value < 0.05,
  “**” as p-Value < 0.01, “***” as p-Value < 0.001. (C) The enrichment plot of the
  chemokine signaling pathway exported by GSEA analysis. (D) Spearman correlation
  with the specific factors involved in the chemokine-chemokine receptors pathway
  gets graphed by the bar plot. CXCL family is colored blue, and the CXCR family is
  colored red. (E) qRT-PCR showed the transcription level of chemokines in GBP5-overexpressed
  HEY cells. “*” stands for p-Value < 0.05, “**” as p-Value < 0.01
