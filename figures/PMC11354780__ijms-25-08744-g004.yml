caption: 'Protein expression after F3.NLGN and F3.NRXN transplantation at the lesion
  site (2 mm rostral and caudal to injury center) in SCI mice. (A) Expression of synaptic
  markers. (B) Expression of BDNF and NGF. (C) Expression of the PI3K/PTEN/mTOR signaling
  pathway after F3.NLGN and F3.NRXN transplantation. Protein expression is analyzed
  by means of Western blotting. (D,E) Band densities normalized to actin. Densitometric
  analysis of the Western blot was performed using ImageJ. n = 10 per treatment group.
  # Significantly different from the normal control (p < 0.05). * Significantly different
  from the vehicle control (p < 0.05). SCI, spinal cord injury; BDNF, brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; NGF, nerve growth factor'
