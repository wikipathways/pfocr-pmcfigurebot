  proteins in Raw 264.
caption: Effect of FLs on LPS-induced inflammatory signaling pathway-related proteins
  in Raw 264.7 macrophages at different time scales. The bar graph represents the
  relative expression of the target protein over the β-actin protein, where the relative
  expression of the protein in the control group was set to 1. Different lowercase
  letters indicate that the data are statistically different (p < 0.05)
