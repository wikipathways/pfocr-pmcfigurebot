caption: 'Ligands and Receptors in the Mammalian Notch Signaling Pathway. It illustrates
  the intricate cell–cell communication within the Notch signaling pathway. A ligand-expressing
  cell (Sender) engages with the Notch receptor situated on the neighboring cell (Receiver),
  thereby instigating a signaling cascade that orchestrates diverse cellular responses
  and regulatory mechanisms. It delves into the unique compositions of Notch signaling
  components in different animals. Notch receptors (Notch1–4) serve as the target
  of interaction between numerous types of Notch ligands, such as Delta-like (DLL1,
  DLL3, DLL4) and Jagged (JAG1, JAG2) to initiate signaling pathways involved in different
  cellular activities. Each domain is represented in the right corner as follows:
  PDZ domain, EGF like repeats, Signal peptide, LNR (Lin-12-Notch Repeats), ANK (Ankyrin),
  DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2), Cysteine-rich, NLS (Nuclear localization signal), TAD
  (Transactivation domain), HD (Heterodimer), RAM (RBPJk-associated module), MNNL
  (membrane-bound Notch N-terminal Fragment L), Von Willebrand factor type C, and
  PEST (sequence rich in proline (P), glutamine (E), serine (S), and threonine (T))'
