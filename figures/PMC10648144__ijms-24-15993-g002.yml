caption: 'Mouse Proteomics: (A,B) Numbers of differentially expressed proteins in
  mouse spleen and mouse plasma. Comparisons are different comparison groups; upregulated
  is upregulated proteins, while downregulated means downregulated proteins. (C–E)
  GO analysis. The abscissa is the rich factor (the proportion of the number of differentially
  expressed proteins annotated to a GO functional category to the total number of
  identified proteins annotated to that GO functional category). The vertical axis
  represented the statistical results of differential proteins under each GO classification.
  Bubble color means significance of enriched GO classification (p-value calculated
  based on Fisher’s Exact Test). Color gradient is the size of the p-value (−log10).
  The closer the color is to red, the smaller the p-value and the higher the significance
  level of enrichment under the corresponding GO classification. (F–J) KEGG pathway.
  The abscissa represents the p-value, while the vertical axis reveals the pathways’
  names. Red (right) represents the upregulation signaling pathway, and blue (left)
  is the downregulation signaling pathway. PBS represents the mice injected with PBS
  and albumin. AB is the mice given MWReg30 and albumin. WG, F-IVIG, M-IVIG, and Mix-IVIG
  represent the mice injected with MWReg30 and WG IVIG, F-IVIG, M-IVIG, and Mix-IVIG,
  respectively'
