figure_title: DNA damage increased p53-dependent transcript levels in ATM Ser49Cys
  variant-expressing cells.
caption: DNA damage increased p53-dependent transcript levels in ATM Ser49Cys variant-expressing
  cells. (A) ATM Ser49Cys demonstrates p53-dependent transcription. Gene expression
  levels of p53 signalling pathway in JA (WT) and 1.202 (Ser49Cys) 2 h post-irradiation.
  Fold change is treated over untreated, normalised with house-keeping genes BACT
  and GAPDH. (B) LCL lines were treated with 0, 5 or 10 μM Nutlin3a for 24 or 48 h.
  Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted for p53, p21 and α-tubulin as loading control.
