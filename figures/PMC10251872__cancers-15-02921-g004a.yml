caption: Gene expression pathways differentially expressed in UC CRC (in blue triangles)
  compared to adjacent non-cancerous UC mucosa (in red squares). The genes are arranged
  on the x-axis by expression level; gene symbols for all the genes in the pathway
  could not be presented in the figure because of space limitation. Log2-transformed
  expression is shown on y-axis. A difference of 1 on the y-axis represents 2-fold
  change
