  COVID-19 patients.
caption: Impaired mitochondrial function in CD8+ T cells from severe/critical COVID-19
  patients. (A) The expression of mitochondrial complex-related genes in different
  cell subsets (C3 and C10) is depicted by dot plot. Pct. exp indicates the percentage
  of cells expressing the gene. Color scale shows the average expression level of
  mitochondrial complex-related genes. (B) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for
  specific CD8+ T cells in severe/critical COVID-19 patients on downregulated mitochondria-related
  pathways. Column chart showing the normalized enrichment scores for the mitochondria-related
  pathways derived from BP, CC, and HPO that are significantly downregulated in C3
  or C10
