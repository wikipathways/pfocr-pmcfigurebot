figure_title: HIF-2α expression and degradation are regulated by ACSS2 activity
caption: (A) Heatmap showing differential gene expression expressed as fold change
  (downregulated or upregulated at least 1.5-fold, adjusted P value ≤ 0.05) between
  control (blue; n = 3) and shACSS2 (red; n = 3) groups. Bar graph showing relative
  transcript counts from HIF-2α RCC signaling pathway comparing control (blue) and
  shACSS2 (red) groups. Statistical significance was determined using multiple unpaired,
  2-tailed t tests (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001). (B) Representative
  Western blot analysis of HIF-2α (n = 3), ACSS2 (n = 3), and actin (n = 3) expression
  following 24-hour doxycycline induction of 786-O pTRIPZ control and pTRIPZ shACSS2
  cells. (C) Representative Western blot analysis assessing expression of HIF-2α (n
  = 3), VEGFR2 (n = 2), Epo (n = 2), and actin (n = 3) in 786-O cells treated with
  DMSO or 1 μM, 5 μM, or 10 μM ACSS2i for 24 hours. (D) Representative Western blot
  analysis showing expression of ACSS2 (n = 6), HIF-2α (n = 4), VEGFR2 (n = 3), Epo
  (n = 3), EGLN3 (n = 3), and actin (n = 6) in 786-O cells transduced with pLX304
  empty vector or pLX304 V5-ACSS2 overexpression vector. (E) Representative Western
  blot and bar chart quantification (n = 3) depicting HIF-2α expression in 786-O cells
  in the absence or presence of a 1-hour incubation with 10 μM MG132 prior to treatment
  with DMSO or 5 μM ACSS2i for 24 hours. (F) Western blot images analyzing LC3 A/B
  (n = 3), K48 polyubiquitination (n = 3), and MUL1 (n = 3) in 786-O cells treated
  with DMSO or 5 μM ACSS2i for 48 hours. Statistical significance was determined using
  2-way ANOVA and Holm-Šidák test for multiple comparisons (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.005).
  Data are represented as mean ± SD. See also Supplemental Figure 2
