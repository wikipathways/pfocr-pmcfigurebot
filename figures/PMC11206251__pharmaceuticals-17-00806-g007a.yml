  and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins.
caption: PEIM regulated the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB, JAK2/STAT3, P53/P21/MDM2,
  and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins. (A) Expression of proteins
  involved TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway of HepG cells treated with PEIM. * p
  < 0.05 compared to the control group. (B) Expression of proteins involved JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway of HepG cells treated with PEIM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared
  to the control group. (C) Expression of proteins involved P53/P21/MDM2 signaling
  pathway of HepG cells treated with PEIM. * p < 0.05 compared to the control group.
  (D) Expression of proteins involved mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway of
  HepG cells treated with PEIM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared to the control group
