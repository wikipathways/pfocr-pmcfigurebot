caption: 'IL-6, an activator of PI3K/Akt/STAT3, partially attenuated B7-H4-induced
  inhibitory effects in SGHPL-5 cells. SGHPL-5 cells were incubated with rhB7-H4/IL-6/LY-294002
  alone or in combination for 24 h, and the levels of PI3K/Akt/STAT3 pathway-related
  proteins, (A) as well as Cyclin D1, p21, and cleaved caspase 3 (B), were determined
  by immunoblotting. (C–E) Quantitative analysis of (A). (F–H) Quantitative analysis
  of (B). Data represent means ± SD of triplicate experiments. Significance: * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01'
