caption: KEGG classification and enrichment analysis for the CK and TF14 libraries.
  (A) The horizontal and vertical axes represent the ratio of genes annotated to this
  pathway to the total number of annotated genes and the name of the KEGG pathway,
  respectively. The label on the right side of the figure represents the classification
  to which the KEGG term belongs. (B) The vertical and horizontal axes represent the
  KEGG pathway and the enrichment factor, respectively, where the larger the enrichment
  factor, the higher the degree of enrichment; the larger the dot, the more differentially
  enriched genes there are; and the redder the dot, the more significant the enrichment
