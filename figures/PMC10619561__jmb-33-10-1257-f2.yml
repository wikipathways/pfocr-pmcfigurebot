figure_title: Genetically encoded biosensor-based directed evolution
caption: (A) Directed evolution of enzymes with the assistance of FACS and genetically
  encoded biosensors. (B) Library construction and high-throughput screening to direct
  the evolution of the metabolic pathway with the assistance of biosensors. (C) Whole
  genome-directed evolution with the assistance of whole-cell biosensors in multi-well
  plates to avoid the accumulation of mutations in biosensors. (D) Continuous directed
  evolution with simultaneous mutation and selection in the cell growth process. Higher
  IPP production would generate lower expression levels of MutD5 and RFP (red fluorescence
  protein), resulting in the accumulation of positive mutations after screening the
  low red fluorescent cells
