figure_title: MoCbp7 is involved in the calcium signaling pathway.
caption: MoCbp7 is involved in the calcium signaling pathway. (A) Wild-type 70-15,
  ΔMocbp7, and Mocbp7C were inoculated on CM plates containing 0.3 M CaCl2 at 25 °C
  with 16 h photoperiod for 9 days; bar, 1 cm. (B) Relative growth rates of wild-type
  70-15, ΔMocbp7, and Mocbp7C on CM plates containing 0.3 M CaCl2. Statistical differences
  were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 8.0 via Tukey’s test (** p < 0.01). (C) Relative
  transcriptional expression of calcium-signaling-related genes in ΔMocbp7 and wild-type
  70-15 treated with 10 μg/mL of FK506 for 1 h. Statistical differences were analyzed
  by GraphPad Prism 8.0 via Tukey’s test (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01)
