caption: 'Roflumilast activates the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway
  to alleviate oxidative stress and the inflammatory response of H9C2 cells induced
  by H/R. (A) Oxidative stress in H/R-induced H9C2 cells with roflumilast and compound
  C treatment were detected by assay kits. (B) Inflammatory factors in H/R-induced
  H9C2 cells with roflumilast and compound C treatment were detected by assay kits.
