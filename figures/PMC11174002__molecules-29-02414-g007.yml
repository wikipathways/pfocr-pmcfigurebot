caption: 'mRNA expression of GABA signaling pathway-related genes in zebrafish embryos
  after treatment with different concentrations of CuCl2 and CuNPs for 96 h. The experiment
  was performed in sextuplicate with N = 30 for each treatment. Data are mean Â± SD.
  * D significant difference versus the control (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). # Denotes
  significant difference between CuCl2 and CuNPs groups (# p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01)'
