  Xushu 48 stem segments at different stages.
caption: Enriched KEGG pathways among the DEGs in the stem rot pathogen-infected Xushu
  48 stem segments at different stages. (A) Quantitative statistics of the DEGs associated
  with different metabolic pathways. The numbers next to the orange, blue, red, green,
  and yellow bars represent the number of DEGs associated with metabolism, genetic
  information processing, environmental information processing, organismal systems,
  and cellular processes, respectively. Correlations among the metabolic pathways
  associated with the DEGs between T1 and T2 (B), T1 and T3 (C), and T2 and T3 (D).
  Each purple dot in (Bâ€“D) represents a metabolic pathway, and the lines connecting
  the two points indicate that there is an upstream and downstream relationship between
  the two metabolic pathways or that there are common differentially expressed genes
