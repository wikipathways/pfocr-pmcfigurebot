figure_title: Pathway choice in replication-coupled ICL repair
caption: 'Bidirectional fork stalling activates TRAIP (orange), which ubiquitinates
  CMG components in trans (MCM subunits shown in pink). Short ubiquitin chains recruit
  NEIL3 glycosylase, providing an opportunity for direct unhooking of ICL. TLS: Translesional
  synthesis. Long ubiquitin chains recruit the p97/VCP ATPase, which extracts replisome
  components and disassembles the replisome. FANCM recognizes the collapsed fork and
  recruits the FA core complex, which activates FANCD2-I by monoubiquitination. Green
  dashed arrow: fork reversal. Activated FANCD2-I forms a sliding clamp on dsDNA—possibly
  cloaking the reannealed parental strands of the reversed fork, as shown. Fork reversal
  and D2-I monoubiquitination are both required for activation of SLX4-XPF. XPF-mediated
  incisions (red triangles) unhook the ICL, setting up gap filling by TLS and repair
  of the two-ended DSB by conservative ‘short tract’ HR.'
