figure_title: Alteration of nucleotide metabolism impacts macrophage function and
  pathogen growth
caption: 'a) Gene ontology enrichment of the pathways that are most highly downregulated
  in 48h stimulated Hprt KO macrophages compared to stimulated WT macrophages.b) Migration
  of WT and Hprt KO (2 clones) RAW 264.7 cells across a transwell towards LPS. Line
  plot with error bar represents mean ± SD (n=5 independent samples).c) Percentage
  of WT or Hprt KO (2 clones) RAW 264.7 cells that are Cytotox green positive at indicated
  time points after treatment with 10 μM nigericin. Cells were either not primed (open
  circle) or primed for 24h with LPS+IFNγ (closed circle). Line plot with error bar
  represents mean ± SD (n=3 independent samples).d) Total fluorescence signal from
  T. gondii at indicated time points after wildtype, Xor KO, or Hprt KO RAW 264.7
  macrophages were infected with mCherry ME49 T. gondii tachyzoites. Line plot with
  error bar represents mean ± SD (n=4 independent samples).e) WT, Xor KO, or Hprt
  KO RAW 264.7 macrophages were infected with mCherry ME49 T. gondii tachyzoites for
  24h and then fixed. Cells were incubated with primary antibody against T. gondii
  surface antigen 1 (SAG1) and counterstained with DAPI. Left: Representative immunofluorescence
  image of Hprt KO RAW 264.7 cell infected by ME49 T. gondii tachyzoites. Right: percentage
  of vacuoles with 1, 2, 4, or 8 parasites per vacuole, quantified from 10 random
  fields of view per coverslip.b, d) Statistical analysis was performed using one-way
  ANOVA followed by post hoc Dunnett’s test comparing all groups to WT. c) Statistical
  analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Dunnett’s test comparing
  all groups to WT 24h priming. * indicates p<0.05; ** indicates p<0.01; *** indicates
  p<0.001; ns indicates not significant'
