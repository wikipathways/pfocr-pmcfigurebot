figure_title: BM-MSC interaction with H929 cells induces changes in BM-MSC expression
  of NF-κB signalling pathway-related molecules.
caption: BM-MSC interaction with H929 cells induces changes in BM-MSC expression of
  NF-κB signalling pathway-related molecules. BM-MSC pre-treated or not with PKC inhibitors
  (HKPS or ENZA) for 2 h were co-cultured for 2 additional hours with H929 cells.
  Then, H929 cells were gently removed, and BM-MSC were trypsinized and lysed for
  protein extraction. (A) Protein extracts were incubated in the Proteome Profiler
  Human NF-κB microarray; higher (yellow squares) and lower (red squares) protein
  expressions are shown. (B) Changes in the expression of NF-κB signalling pathway-related
  molecules in BM-MSC by dot density quantification. The integrated area was made
  using ImageJ software, and data are expressed as mean ± SEM. A non-parametric two-way
  ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed for statistical analysis.
