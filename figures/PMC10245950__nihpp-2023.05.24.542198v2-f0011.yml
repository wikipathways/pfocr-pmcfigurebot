figure_title: Electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation in oxaliplatin
  treated mice
caption: Oxaliplatin affects the oxidative phosphorylation by downregulation genes
  associated with the proteins for Complex I, Complex II and Complex IV, reducing
  the strength of the hydrogen ion gradient. Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2 encoded by
  Slc25a8) was the only upregulated. UCP2 generate heat by dissipating the hydrogen
  ion gradient of the cristae instead of allowing ATP formation. The pathway is derived
  from the KEGG database. Blue – upregulated complexes, red downregulated complexes,
  grey – not affected
