figure_title: Phosphoproteomics reveals Wnt pathway activation in fibroblast-specific
  Smo-deletion kidneys after AKI
caption: '(A) Workflow of phosphoproteomics. (B) Principal component analysis of phosphoproteins
  from Gli1-Smo+/+ and Gli1-Smo–/– kidneys 1 day after ischemic AKI. (C) Volcano plot
  of pairwise comparisons (fold-change, FC) between the kidney phosphoproteomes of
  Gli1-Smo+/+ and Gli1-Smo–/– kidneys 1 day after ischemic AKI. (D) qPCR of Wnt 1,
  2, 4, 5A, 5B, 7A, 7B, 9B, 10A, 10B, 11, and 16 mRNA in Gli1-Smo+/+ and Gli1-Smo–/–
  kidneys 1 day after ischemic AKI. *P < 0.05 (n = 7–12). (E) Western blots of β-catenin,
  Wnt 1, and Wnt 5A/B proteins in Gli1-Smo+/+ and Gli1-Smo–/– kidneys 1 day after
  ischemic AKI. Numbers indicate individual animals in a given group. (F) Western
  blots of β-catenin and Wnt 1 in Pdgfr-β-Smo+/+ and Pdgfr-β-Smo–/– kidneys 1 day
  after ischemic AKI. Numbers indicate individual animals in a given group. (G) IHC
  staining showing β-catenin, Wnt1, Wnt 4, and Wnt5A/B in Gli1-Smo+/+ and Gli1-Smo–/–
  or in Pdgfr-β-Smo+/+ and Pdgfr-β-Smo–/– kidneys 1 day after ischemic AKI. Scale
  bar: 25 μm. (H) IHC staining showing Wnt1, Wnt 4, and Wnt5A/B expression in kidney
  biopsy specimens from patients with AKI. Arrows indicate positive staining. Scale
  bar: 25 μm. Graphs are presented as means ± SEM. Differences between groups were
  analyzed using unpaired t tests'
