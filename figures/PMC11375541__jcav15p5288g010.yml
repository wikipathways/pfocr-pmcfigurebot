caption: The dual functionality of necroptosis in CC patients. Necroptosis plays a
  dichotomous role in the progression of CC. On one hand, necroptosis facilitates
  the proliferation of CC cells by upregulating the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway and
  augmenting VEGFA expression. Treatment with bevacizumab in CC cells induces necroptosis,
  and concurrent administration of necroptosis inhibitors synergistically attenuates
  VEGFA expression. Conversely, necroptosis elicits T cell activation and bolsters
  anti-tumor immune responses through the activation of the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway
