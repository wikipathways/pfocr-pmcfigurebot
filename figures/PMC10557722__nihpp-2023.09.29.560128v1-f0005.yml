figure_title: Transcriptional profiling reveals that JADE3 activates the TNF/NF-kB
  signaling pathway
caption: A. Principal component analysis scatter plot showing differential gene expression
  signatures of control, JADE3 or JADE2 expressing cells. PC1 and PC2 corresponding
  to the principal component 1 and principal component 2.B. Volcano plot of RNA-seq
  of A549 JADE3 Flag cells vs vector control cells. An FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.01
  (dotted line) was considered significant. Data is from three biological replicates.C.
  Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) significantly upregulated
  by JADE3 Flag vs vector control and JADE2 Flag vs vector control.D. Gene set enrichment
  analysis of the 500 most significantly upregulated genes in A549 cells expressing
  either JADE3 Flag or a vector control. The 10 most significantly enriched gene sets
  are shown
article_title: Genome-wide CRISPR activation screen identifies JADE3 as an antiviral
  activator of NF-kB
