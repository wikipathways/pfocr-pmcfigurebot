figure_title: SCFAs induce proliferation and strengthen oxidative defense.
caption: 'SCFAs induce proliferation and strengthen oxidative defense. SFCAs bind
  to FFARs and activate the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, inducing proliferation.
  Furthermore, stimulation of the FFAR receptor by SCFA butyrate shifts the AMP/ATP
  ratio and induces AMPK. Activated AMPK induces translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus.
  In addition, inhibition of HDACs also increases Nrf2 synthesis. Thus, Nrf2-mediated
  activation of oxidative defense mechanisms occurs. SCFA: short- chain fatty acid;
  FFAR: free fatty acid receptor; RAS: rat sarcoma virus protein; RAF: rapidly accelerated
  fibrosarcoma protein; MEK: mitogen activated kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; HDAC: histone deacetylase; Nrf2: Nuclear
  Factor Erythroid 2-related Factor 2. The figure was created with BioRender.com (accessed
