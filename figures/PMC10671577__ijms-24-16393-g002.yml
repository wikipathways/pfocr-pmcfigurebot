caption: Differentially expressed miRNAs in T. forsythia-infected mandibles (8 and
  16 weeks). (A) The volcano plot depicts the upregulated (green) and downregulated
  (red) miRNAs that showed a fold difference of ±1.1 with a p-value of <0.05 during
  T. forsythia infection. Fold changes (log2 fold change) are displayed on the x axis,
  the y axis shows the t-statistic derived as the negative decimal logarithm of the
  p-value [−log10(p)]. Thresholds are highlighted with dotted lines representing the
  promising miRNAs in the upper left and upper right. The black dots represent the
  miRNAs that do not pass the filter parameters. Five significantly upregulated miRNAs
  and nine downregulated miRNAs were identified in 16-week T. forsythia-infected mice
  compared to the 8-week T. forsythia-infected mice (n = 10). (B) Venn diagram analysis
  illustrates the distribution of DE miRNAs in the 8-week and 16-week infections with
  T. forsythia. (C) Predicted functional pathway analysis of DE miRNAs from T. forsythia-infected
  mandibles. Bubble plot of KEGG analysis on predicted target genes of DE-upregulated
  miRNAs in T. forsythia-infected mice (16-week duration) comparing sham-infected
  mice. The KEGG pathways are displayed on the y axis, and the x axis represents the
  false discovery rate (FDR) which means the probability of false positives in all
  tests. The size and color of dots represent the number of predicted genes and the
  corresponding p-values, respectively. Thirteen DE miRs are shown to be involved
  in the MAPK signaling pathway
