caption: Histopathological assessment of canine healthy and myxomatous mitral valves.
  (A) Representative images (two biological replicates) of H&E staining in canine
  healthy and myxomatous mitral valves, scale bar 200 μm (magnified 100 μm). (B) Representative
  immunohistochemistry images of TGF‐β1 and PI3K 110α expressions (yellow/brown) in
  canine healthy and myxomatous mitral valves, scale bar 100 μm. (C) Representative
  confocal immunofluorescent images of TGF‐β1, PI3K 110α and α‐SMA expressions in
  canine healthy and myxomatous mitral valves, scale bar 20 μm. (D) Quantitative analysis
  of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of TGF‐β1, PI3K 110α and α‐SMA in canine healthy
  and myxomatous mitral valves. (E) Representative images of co‐localization ratio
  analysis of TGF‐β1 (green) and α‐SMA (red), PI3K 110α (green) and α‐SMA (red) fluorescence
  signals in canine mitral valve tissues. (F) Quantitative analysis of co‐localization
  parameters (Pearson's correlation and overlap coefficient) of TGF‐β1 (green) and
  α‐SMA (red), PI3K 110α (green) and α‐SMA (red) fluorescence signals. Results are
  presented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA followed by Tukey's range test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.01 compared to control. ANOVA, analysis of variance; H&E, haematoxylin
  and eosin.
