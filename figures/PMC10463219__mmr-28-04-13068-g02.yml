figure_title: Effects of RSV on DDIT4 and mTOR pathway indicators in C2C12 cells with
  PA-induced insulin resistance.
caption: 'Effects of RSV on DDIT4 and mTOR pathway indicators in C2C12 cells with
  PA-induced insulin resistance. (A) mRNA and (B) protein expression levels of DDIT4
  in C2C12 cells was increased after RSV treatment. (C) mRNA and (D) protein expression
  levels of mTOR pathway indicators in C2C12 cells were decreased after RSV treatment.
  (E) Semi-quantification of p-protein/t-protein ratios for mTOR pathway indicators,
  which were decreased after RSV treatment. (B and D) All cells were treated with
  100 nM insulin for 30 min before western blotting. Data are presented as the mean
  ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05 vs. CON, #P<0.05 vs. PA. CON, control; RSV, resveratrol; PA,
  palmitic acid; DDIT4, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4; p70S6K, p70 ribosomal protein
  S6 kinase; p-, phosphorylated; t-t, total'
