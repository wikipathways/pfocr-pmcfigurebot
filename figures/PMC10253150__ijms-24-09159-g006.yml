caption: Wnt signaling pathway, including the canonical pathway, the pathway associated
  with cell polarity determination (Wnt/PCP), and an increase in intracellular Ca2+
  (Wnt/Ca2+), whose genes were significantly regulated in the ZG zone. Each gene involved
  in the pathway is marked with a separate rectangle. If the expression of a particular
  gene changed, this was marked with the corresponding color in the diagram, as shown
  in the legend
