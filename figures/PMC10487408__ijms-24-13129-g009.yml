  SFE enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the kidney by activating the Nrt2–ARE signaling pathway. (A) The expression levels of Nrf2, HO−1, NQO1, and GCLM were detected via western blot analysis. (B) Quantification of Nrf2 expression. (C) Quantification of HO−1 expression. (D) Quantification of NQO1 expression. (E) Quantification of GCLM expression. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 6–8). ###
