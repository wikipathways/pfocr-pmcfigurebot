caption: Crosstalk between IL-6 signaling and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in EAOC. (1)
  IL-6 is a physiological target of ARID1A tumor-suppressor activity, which is frequently
  deficient in EAOC [75]. (2) IL-6 expression is promoted by PI3K, including its catalytic
  subunit PIK3CA, which is commonly amplified in EAOC [101]. (3) IL-6 triggers the
  JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which, in turn, has been shown to interact directly
  with the p58a regulatory subunit of PI3K and to upregulate the expression of AKT
  [102,103,104]. (4) IL-6 induces the expression of miR-21, a microRNA that impedes
  PTEN translation and is increased in EAOC [105,106]. ARID1A, AT-rich interaction
