figure_title: HFD-induced activation of SMADS and NF-κB signaling pathway is attenuated
  in TLR4 deficient mice.
caption: 'HFD-induced activation of SMADS and NF-κB signaling pathway is attenuated
  in TLR4 deficient mice. Cardiac mRNA levels of (A) TLR4, (B) SMAD7, (C) α-SMA, (D)
  p65, (E) IkBb, and (F) caspase-3 in TLR4−/− mice and WT controls after 28 weeks
  exposure to either ND or HFD. n = 4–6. Statistical significances are denoted with
  asterisks as follows: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01'
