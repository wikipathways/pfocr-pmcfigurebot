caption: Different interventions enhance nerve regeneration for the treatment of AD.
  The quarter labeled ‘A’ shows nerv.sse regeneration induced by neurotrophins in
  the treatment of AD. BDNF mediates the activity of TrkB/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway
  to regulate the survival of nerve cells and synaptic plasticity, marking it as a
  potential therapeutic target for neurodegeneration. NGF triggers the activity of
  the NGF-TrkA or NGF-p75NTR signalling pathway to maintain the normal activity of
  neurons, which can ameliorate the problems of synaptic failure and neurotransmission
  defects in patients with AD. The quarter labeled ‘B’ shows nerve regeneration induced
  by inhibitors in the treatment of AD. AChEI drugs, on the one hand inhibit AChE
  activity and reduce the decomposition of Ach, but on the other hand activate nAChRs
  and improve glutamate transport, thereby activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and upregulating
  the downstream target protein Bcl-2, and therefore inducing the survival of nerve
  cells, enhancing the connection between synapses. HDAC enzyme inhibitors increase
  acetylation modifications of histones and the expression of BDNF genes, which have
  a better therapeutic effect on AD. The quarter labeled ‘C’ shows nerve regeneration
  induced by brain stimulation in the treatment of AD. rTMS, tDCS and 1072-nm NIR
  light raise the synaptic activity of neuronal circuits in the brain via an increase
  in γ-aminobutyric acid and BDNF. The quarter labeled ‘D’ shows nerve regeneration
  induced by the transplantation of neural stem cells in the treatment of AD. Exogenous
  NSCs, iPSCs or MSCs are transplanted into the diseased brain region, which not only
  have the role of replenishing lost neurons, but also have the auxiliary role of
  secreting neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and NGF or EXOs and iEXOs to improve
  nerve regeneration. AD, Alzheimer's disease; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
