caption: 'The proposed model for the pathogenic role of the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling
  pathway in RA and its clinical implications as the therapeutic potential. Several
  ligands that bind to TNFRs and TLRs can activate nuclear factor (NF)-κB. As a transcription
  factor, activated NF-κB can translocate into the nucleus and thereby activate the
  expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. As an endogenous ligand, anti-citrullinated peptide
  antibodies (ACPA) can promote NF-κB phosphorylation through binding to TNFRs and
  TLRs. In the second signal, extracellular ATP can bind to P2X7 and thereby lead
  to K+ efflux and extracellular Ca++ influx, which activate the NLRP3 inflammasome
  with the overproduction of the mature form of IL-1β and IL-18. The NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation also leads to the cleavage of gasdermin D, which promotes pyroptosis
  with the formation of pores in the cell membrane and the release of IL-1β and IL-18.
  ACPA can also activate the pannexin channel, resulting in ATP secretion and NLRP3
  inflammation activation. In RA monocytes, complement C1q and pentaxin 3 (PTX3) synergistically
  activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis. Several compounds have been identified
  as inhibitors of the components of the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. MCC950,
  VX-765, osthole, and sulforaphane can inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  Tofacitinib, one JAKi, may restore the balance of γδTreg/γδT17 cells in RA by inhibiting
  the NLRP3 inflammasome. Disulfiram inhibits GSDMD and thereby blocks pyroptosis
  and the release of IL-1β and IL-18. Anakinra, an IL-1β receptor antagonist, blocks
  the effects of NLRP3 inflammasome downstream cytokine. Among natural products, both
  Baihu-Guizhi decoction (BHGZD) and celastrol can inhibit NLRP3 activation by blocking
  the NF-κB pathway. HCQ could inhibit Ca2+-activated K+ channels and then impair
  inflammasome activation. The microRNA-30a and miR-223 inhibit the expression of
  NLRP3 and inflammasome activation. Red arrows indicate activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
