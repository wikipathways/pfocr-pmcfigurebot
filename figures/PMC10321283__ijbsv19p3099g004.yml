figure_title: miR-6836 regulates Yap1 subcellular localization by targeting DLG2.
caption: 'miR-6836 regulates Yap1 subcellular localization by targeting DLG2. a Bubble
  chart revealing the functional enrichment pattern of SKOV3 attached cells and spheroids.
  b Bubble chart revealing the functional enrichment pattern of CAOV3 transfected
  with mimic/mi-NC. c Venn diagram of putative miR-6836 candidate target genes predicted
  by Targetscan, and genes involved in Notch signaling and Hippo signaling pathway.
  d Spearman correlation analysis between DLG2 mRNA and miR-6836 expression levels
  in EOC tissues (n=46). The expression level of DLG2 and miR-6836 was measured by
  RT-qPCR. e RT-qPCR analysis of DLG2 expression level in A2780/CAOV3 treated with
  mimic/mi-NC or inhibitor/in-NC. f Western blot analysis of DLG2 expression in A2780/CAOV3
  treated with mimic/mi-NC or inhibitor/in-NC. g The schematic diagram on the left
  shows the dual luciferase reporter plasmids construction containing wild type (WT)
  or mutated (MUT) miR-6836 binding site in DLG2 3'' UTR. 293T cells were transfected
  with WT/MUT recombined luciferase report vector and mimic/mi-NC. Luciferase reporter
  activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. h Western blot analysis
  of p-Yap1, Yap1, Bax, Bcl2 and β-actin expression in OVCAR3/A2780 treated with mimic/mi-NC
  or A2780/CAOV3 with inhibitor/in-NC. i Western blot analysis of Yap1 expression
  in the nucleus and cytoplasm of CAOV3/SKOV3 Ctrl or Lv-miR-6836. j Immunofluorescence
  assay for the subcellular localization of Yap1 caused by mimic/mi-NC or inhibitor/in-NC
  treatment. Scale bar, 10 μm. k RT-qPCR analysis of miR-6836 expression in A2780/CAOV3
  treated with si-TEAD1/si-NC. l Schematic diagram shows the possible TEAD1 binding
  regions of miR-6836 promoter region. ChIP assay is performed using TEAD1 antibodies
  and IgG as the negative control. m Luciferase reporter assay: 293T cells were transfected
  with si-TEAD1/si-NC and recombined luciferase report vector containing miR-6836
  promoter region. Luciferase reporter activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase
  activity. n The schematic diagram of miR-6836-DLG2-Yap1-TEAD1 positive feedback
  loops in regulating EOC cisplatin resistance. In resistant EOC cells, miR-6836 suppressed
  apoptosis and activated stemness by directly targeting DLG2, and further promoted
  Yap1 nuclear translocation and interaction with TEAD1. TEAD1 is both the transcriptional
  regulator and downstream for miR-6836. Results are presented as mean ± SEM; *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01, ***P<0.001'
