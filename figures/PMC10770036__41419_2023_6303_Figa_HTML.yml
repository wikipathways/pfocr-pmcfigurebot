figure_title: Novel dual inhibitors of PARP and HDAC induce intratumoral STING-mediated
  antitumor immunity in triple-negative breast cancer
caption: Novel dual PARP and HDAC inhibitors induce BRCAness to restore synthetic
  lethality, activating tumoral IFN signaling via the cGASâ€“STING pathway and inducing
  cytokine production, promoting neoantigen generation and presentation to enhance
  the immune response
