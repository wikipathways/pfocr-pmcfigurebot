caption: Fibroblast-based therapies for modulating PMN formation. The enzyme-activated
  assembly peptide FR17 prevents the recruitment of MDSCs through hindering the deposition
  of ECM and limiting the activation of lung fibroblasts, thereby retarding the production
  of immunosuppressive microenvironment. Liposome nano vesicles containing miR-29a-3p
  are able to be targeted and delivered to the lung, thereby hampering the release
  of type I collagen by pulmonary fibroblasts and suppressing the formation of PMN.
  JPJDR, a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, represses the TNFIP3/NF-ÎºB signaling
  pathway to antagonize the activation of CAFs and attenuate the production of ITGBL1-rich
  EVs by tumor cells, thereby curbing the microenvironment to delay tumor metastasis
