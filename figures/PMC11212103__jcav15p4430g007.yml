caption: Schematic illustration of the potential mechanism of naringin combined with
  Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NCU-01 to reverse cisplatin resistance in
  ovarian cancer. NCU-01 can increase the expression of intestinal permeability-related
  proteins ZO-1 and occludin by regulate intestinal microbiota, inhibit TLR4/NF-ÎºB-induced
  intestinal inflammation, and then inhibit the p38MAPK signaling pathway through
  blood circulation, downregulate the expression of ERCC1, and reverse cisplatin resistance
  in ovarian cancer.
