caption: A scheme of SOD1 involvement in antigen-dependent T cell response. Recognition
  of antigen by TCR, inside MHC complex expressed on the surface of the Antigen Presenting
  Cell, induces rapid recruitment of SOD1 molecules near the TCR clusters; this phenomenon
  is accompanied by increased SOD1-mRNA, followed by SOD1 export by a microvesicle
  pathway. Extracellular SOD1 has been observed to mediate enhanced IL17 production
  by activated T lymphocytes. This effect depends on enzymatic activity of SOD1; the
  involvement of IL17 in induction/maintenance of chronic proinflammatory processes
  has been extensively studied by others. The image has been partially created by
  using BioRender.com.
