caption: Intestinal barrier and elements involved in the influence of cannabinoids
  on its permeability. The effect of cannabinoids on intestinal permeability is achieved
  mainly through the CB1, TRPV1, MAPK, and adenylate cyclase signaling pathways, but
  also through the activation of PPARÎ±. Cannabinoids may also cause changes in the
  synthesis of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens, claudin, occludin), which
  play a significant role in regulating the integrity of the intestinal barrier. The
