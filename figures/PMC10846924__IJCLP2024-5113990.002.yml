caption: Description of the clinical traits, immune features, and biological function
  for the diverse patterns. The clinical features including French-American-British
  (FAB) classification (a), molecular features (b), cytogenetic risk (c), and the
  specific molecular features (d) were also investigated in the HOVON cohort in different
  patterns. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the upregulated (e) and downregulated
  (f) differential expression genes between pattern B and pattern A, respectively.
  (g) Using four algorithms, including ESTIMATE, quanTIseq. XCell, and ssGSEA, the
  infiltration of immune cells was calculated in different patterns. The two-sided
  p value <0.05 was considered significant for all statistical analyses and shown
  as ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001
