caption: 'CNSE and RESV suppress MAPKs activation. BV-2 cells were incubated with
  CNSE or RESV for 24 h, followed by LPS 1 μg/mL for 30 min. The relative protein
  expression of (A) p-JNK, (B) p-ERK1/2 and (C) p-p38 was observed by Western blot
  analysis and normalized with β-actin. Data represent the mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments. The significant difference was represented by p-value less than 0.05
  (##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. non-treated control, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01 vs. LPS-treated
  control).'
