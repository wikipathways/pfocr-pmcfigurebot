caption: A schematic representation illustrates the role of miRNAs in the regulation
  of FOSL1. Different miRNAs act to modulate (inhibit) the expression levels of FOSL1,
  thus exerting an influence on various aspects of cancer behavior. Through the downregulation
  of FOSL1, these miRNAs influence the Wnt signaling pathway, apoptosis, cell proliferation,
  cell cycle, invasion, and migration, ultimately resulting in the reduction in tumor
  growth across a range of types
