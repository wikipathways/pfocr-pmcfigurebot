caption: DEM and DEG interaction analysis revealed that PPAR signaling is involved
  in the regulation of lipid deposition. (A) KEGG enrichment analysis of transcriptome
  and metabolome. (B) regulatory networks of key enriched genes and metabolite interactions
  in the PPAR signaling pathway. In the network, nodes in yellow represent the upregulated
  DEGs, those in red represent the upregulated DEGs, and those in green represent
  the microbe. (C) Pearson correlation analysis of key genes and metabolites in the
  PPAR signaling pathway. (D) Validation of key gene expression in PPAR signaling.
  Data were analyzed with Student’s t-test. Results are indicated as means ± SD, n
  = 9. * indicates a significant difference between the CL and FL groups (*, p < 0.05;
  **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001)
