caption: The changes in the expression of key proteins of MAPK signaling pathway after
  LPS stimulation at different concentrations. (A) Effects of 0, 1, 5, 10 μg/mL LPS
  on P-JNK, P-ERK, P-p38 MAPK, JNK, ERK, p38 MAPK and β-actin protein expression in
  RECs; (B–D) phosphorylation levels of JNK, ERK and p38 MAPK. ** p < 0.01, ** was
  compared to 0 μg/mL group. N = 5 in each group
