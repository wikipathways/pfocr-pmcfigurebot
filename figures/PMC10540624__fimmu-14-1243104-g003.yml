caption: Metabolic reprogramming of macrophages. In a steady state, glucose in Mϕs
  is metabolized to acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) by the glycolysis pathway, and further metabolized
  for energy production in the TCA cycle (top). When Mϕs receive an inflammatory stimulus,
  such as that provided by TLR agonists, they shift to an inflammatory M1 type of
  metabolism in which lactate production is dominant in glycolysis and itaconate is
  synthesized from aconitate. Because this itaconate inhibits the succinate dehydrogenase
  that converts succinate to fumarate, the TCA cycle flux is disrupted. The inhibition
  of succinate dehydrogenase leads to accumulation of succinate, which in turn stabilizes
  HIF1α, a critical transcription factor for the induction of proinflammatory cytokines,
  including IL-1β (left). In M2 or anti-inflammatory type Mϕs, metabolism is highly
  dependent on ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) based on fatty
  acid oxidation (right). In the absence of Slc15a4, PDH activity is reduced, thereby
  impairing the coupling between glycolysis and the TCA cycle, and reducing the supply
  of Ac-CoA to the TCA cycle (meanwhile, glycolysis is skewed to produce more lactate).
  The reduced Ac-CoA level in the TCA cycle decreases downstream products, including
  itaconate and succinate, while the compensatory use of glutamine is increased. This
  imbalance in metabolism alters the pattern of inflammatory cytokine production (middle)
  (). Metabolites that characterize M1 Mϕs are indicated by red lines and metabolites
  that characterize M2 Mϕs are indicated by blue lines.
