caption: Differentially expressed genes within Ca4+ microvascular endothelial cells
  predicted reduced cell division, reduced cell movement and increased apoptosis in
  CDH. Differential gene expression was determined for both CDH and NC lungs compared
  to healthy controls and analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Expression
  of genes attached to biological pathways detected by IPA are shown in heatmaps as
  differentially expressed in both CDH and NC lungs (a), differentially expressed
  in only CDH lungs (b) and differentially expressed in only NC lungs (c). Differentially
  expressed Ca4+ microvascular endothelial cell genes identified in the heatmaps are
  sorted by smallest to largest log2FC. Several biological processes related to cell
  cycle and cell division were predicted by IPA to be uniquely downregulated in E21.5
  CDH Ca4+ enodthelial cells (d). IPA predicted increased apoptosis, organismal death
  and cell movement in these cells from both the CDH and NC groups (d, e). Activation
  states for the different biological processes were inferred from z-scores, which
  relate experimentally observed differential gene expression with literature-derived
  directions of effect to predict implicated biological functions independent of the
  associated p-values. Activation z-scores ≥|2| were considered most significant by
  convention.
