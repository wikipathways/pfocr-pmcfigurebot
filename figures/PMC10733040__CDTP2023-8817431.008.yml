caption: 'A potential mechanism by which Hcy caused injury in HUVECs. Hcy-induced
  impaired autophagy and ER stress in HUVECs, which was associated with increased
  protein expression levels of AT1. AT1 block or silence improved autophagy and ER
  stress and attenuated apoptosis, at least partially, through suppressing GSK-3Î²/mTOR
  signaling pathway in HUVEC cells. Hcy: homocysteine; AT1: angiotensin II type 1
  receptor; TDZD-8: 4-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione'
