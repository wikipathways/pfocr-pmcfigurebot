  correlate positively with NFE2L2 expression in T-ALL patients.
caption: Genetic signatures of NRF2-induced transcriptional targets and signalling
  correlate positively with NFE2L2 expression in T-ALL patients. (A,B) Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis was performed in 38 T-ALL patients with publicly available gene expression
  data [32] based on their NFE2L2 expression levels as a continuous variable. These
  signatures were selected from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), and their
  systematic names are M42510 (IBRAHIM_NRF2_UP), M45021 (REACTOME_KEAP1_NFE2L2_PATHWAY),
  M5941 (HALLMARK_UV_RESPONSE_UP), and M5938 (HALLMARK_ REACTIVE_OXYGEN_SPECIES_PATHWAY).
  The green curve corresponds to the enrichment score (ES) curve, which is the running
  sum of the weighted score obtained with the GSEA software v4.2.1. ROS, Reactive
  Oxygen Species; NES, normalised enrichment score; NOM-p, nominal p value. (C) A
  significant positive correlation between NFE2L2 and FTH1 (left) and FTL (right)
  transcriptional levels (scaled Affymetrix average difference expression values)
  in the cohort from [32]. The values for Spearman r and corresponding p-value are
  shown, although both parametric (Pearson) and non-parametric (Spearman) analyses
  revealed statistical significance
