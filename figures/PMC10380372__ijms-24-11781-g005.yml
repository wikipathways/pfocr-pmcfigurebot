caption: Expression of proteins related to the GSH synthesis pathway in OCCC cell
  lines and association between the intercellular iron concentration and ferroptosis
  induced by the combined treatment of PTX and SAS. (A) Levels of xCT, CGL, GCLC and
  GPx4 activation were examined in TOV21G, RMG-1, HAC-2, ES-2, SKOV-3 and Caov3 cells.
  Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-xCT, anti-CGL, anti-GCLC, anti-GPx4, and anti-β-actin
  antibodies; β-actin was used as an internal control. (B) Viability of HAC-2 cells
  treated with or without 10 nM PTX and 400 μM SAS for 24 h in the absence or presence
  of 1 mM PAG. Cell viability was calculated from the ratio of the absorbance of cells
  treated to that of the untreated cells (set as 1) (n = 8). Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD. * p < 0.05. (C) Viability of Caov-3 cells treated with or without
  10 nM PTX and 400 μM SAS for 24 h in the absence or presence of ferrostatin-1 (1
  μM). Subsequently, cell viability was assessed using an MTS assay. Cell viability
  was calculated from the ratio of the absorbance of cells treated to that of the
  untreated cells (set as 1) (n = 8). Data are presented as the mean ± SD. N.S; not
  significant. (D) Caov-3 and ES-2 cells were cultured for 24 h and the intracellular
  iron levels were calculated from the ratio of the absorbance of these cells to that
  of ES-2 cells (set as 1) (n = 6). * p < 0.05 vs. ES-2 cells. (E) Viability of Caov-3
  cells cultured in the presence of 100 µM ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate
  for 30 min and subsequently treated with or without 10 nM PTX and 400 μM SAS for
  24 h in the absence or presence of ferrostatin-1 (1 μM). Cell viability was calculated
  from the ratio of the absorbance of cells treated to that of the untreated cells
  (set as 1) (n = 8). Data are presented as the mean ± SD. * p < 0.05. (F) OCCC cell
  lines were cultured for 24 h and the intracellular iron levels were calculated from
  the ratio of the absorbance of these cells to that of ES-2 cells (set as 1) (n =
  6). Data are presented as the mean ± SD. * p < 0.05 vs. ES-2 cells. N.S; not significant.
  (G) ES-2 cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of 10 nM PTX and/or 400 μM
  SAS and the lipid ROS levels were analyzed by means of flow cytometry after staining
  with BODIPY C11. Lipid ROS levels were calculated from the ratio of the intensity
  of DCF fluorescence of treated cells to that of untreated cells (set as 1) (n =
  5). Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Different letters above the bars indicate
  a significant difference (p < 0.05, n = 5, in each group). SAS, sulfasalazine; PTX,
  paclitaxel; PAG, propargylglycine; −, without; +, with
