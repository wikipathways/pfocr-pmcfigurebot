figure_title: Germline and somatic mutations associated with primary aldosteronism
caption: Pathological autonomous aldosterone production in a cell can occur by a number
  of different mechanisms. (1) In familial hyperaldosteronism (FH)-I, the CYP11B1/CYP11B2
  hybrid gene is activated by cAMP signalling, which occurs when adrenocorticotropic
  hormone (ACTH) binds to the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) in response to hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
  axis (HPAA) activation. (2) GNA11 and GNAQ mutations in aldosterone-producing adenomas
  (APAs) prevent termination of G protein signalling downstream of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
  system, which is activated when angiotensin II (ANGII) binds to the angiotensin
  1 receptor (AT1R)), leading to increased calcium release from intracellular stores
  via the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signalling pathway. These mutations co-occur
  with CTNNB1 mutations, which are found in APAs and adrenocarcinomas, and prevent
  β-catenin degradation, leading to increased transcription of target genes such as
  LHCGR. (3) CLCN2 mutations in FH-II and APAs, KCNJ5 mutations in FH-III and APAs,
  and ATP1A1 and ATP2B3 mutations in APAs lead to abnormal permeabilities for Cl-
  Na+, H+, and Ca2+. These abnormalities cause cell depolarization, which increases
  intracellular calcium concentrations, thereby stimulating CYP11B2 expression and
  aldosterone production. Acidification and an impaired pump function may also have
  a pathological role (not shown). (4) CACNA1H mutations in FH-IV and APAs and CACNA1D
  in primary aldosteronism with seizures and neurological abnormalities (PASNA) and
  APAs increase calcium permeability by stimulating the calcium signalling pathway
  directly. High-probability pathogenic somatic mutations have also been found in
  DPYSL2 and VAPA. DPYSL2 is highly abundant in the zona glomerulosa and has previously
  been linked to ion-channel trafficking. Based on sequence prediction, we hypothesize
  that it may bind to the β-subunit binding site of Cav1.3 (refs. 63,171). VAPA is
  also linked to protein trafficking and is thought to be expressed on the endoplasmic
  reticulum where IP3 signalling acts on the calcium channel to release calcium from
  intracellular stores
