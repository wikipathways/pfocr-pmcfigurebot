caption: Overview of the canonical pathway (WNT/β-catenin pathway). (A) The signalling
  pathway is considered in the “OFF STATE” when no WNT ligands bind to their respective
  receptors, LRP5/6, and its co-receptor, Fz receptors. Consequently, no recruitment
  of the Dsh protein occurs, leading to the phosphorylation of β-catenin by the conserved
  destruction complex (APC, Axin, PP2A, GSK3β, and CK1α). This phosphorylation triggers
  the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin, inhibiting its ability to bind to the
  corresponding transcription factor, TCF/LEF, and regulating the expression of target
  genes (portrayed as red X). (B) The cascade is in the “ON STATE”, where WNT ligands
  bind to the Fz receptors and their LRP5/6 co-receptors, resulting in the recruitment
  of Dsh to the plasma membrane, disrupting the β-catenin destruction complex. This
  disruption allows β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate into
  the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF, initiating the transcriptional expression
  of target genes such as C-MYC, C-JUN, and Cyclin D1 (portrayed as black arrow).
