caption: Novel-m0230-3p regulates CSF1 expression via CSF1/CSF1R/Ras signaling pathway
  to affect cellular TJs and adhesion. (A) mRNA expression of CSF1R, Ras, Occludin,
  and ZO-1 was measured by qRT-PCR after transfection of 100 nM mimic into SCs for
  48 h. Values represent mean ± SD; n = 3. ** p < 0.01. (B) Protein expression of
  CSF1R, Ras, Occludin, and ZO-1 was assessed by Western blotting after transfection
  of 100 nM mimic into SCs for 48 h. (C) mRNA expression of CSF1R, Ras, Occludin,
  and ZO-1 was measured by qRT-PCR after transfection of 100 nM inhibitor into SCs
  for 48 h. Values represent mean ± SD; n = 3, ** p < 0.01. (D) Protein expression
  of CSF1R, Ras, Occludin, and ZO-1 was assessed by Western blotting after transfection
  of 100 nM inhibitor into SCs for 48 h
