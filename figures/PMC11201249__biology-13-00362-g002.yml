figure_title: Schematic presentation of mTOR modulation pathways.
caption: 'Schematic presentation of mTOR modulation pathways. Three primary signaling
  pathways are known to converge to modulate the action of the mTOR peptide. Depending
  on metabolic, hormonal, and nutritional conditions, crosstalk mechanisms supported
  by these pathways regulate mTOR stimulation and activity. (I) Growth factor signaling
  pathway: IRS 1/2, subtypes 1/2 of Insulin Receptor Substrate; PI3K, Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase;
  PDK1, Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinase-1; (II) ATP/energy sensitive signaling
  pathway: AMPK, Activated Protein Kinase by Adenosine Monophosphate; TSC1, Tuberous
  Sclerosis Complex-1; TSC2, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-2; and (III) Amino Acid-Sensitive
  Signaling Pathway: GATOR 1, Rags-Related GAP Complex; DEPDC5, DEP protein, containing
  domain 5; NPRL2, Nitrogen Permease Regulatory protein type 2; NPRL3, Nitrogen Permease
  Regulatory protein type 3. Illustration adapted from previous studies [73,74,75];
  for more complete details, see Han and Wang (2018) [73], Ma and Blenis (2009) [74],
  and Crino (2016) [75]'
