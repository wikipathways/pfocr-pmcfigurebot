figure_title: Effects of AhR ligands on different types of breast cancer cells.
caption: Effects of AhR ligands on different types of breast cancer cells. (A) TCDD,
  as a typical exogenous AhR ligand, affects the proliferation, apoptosis and migration/invasion
  via different pathways in different types of breast cancer cells. It promotes proliferation
  and inhibits migration/invasion in ER-positive cells, inhibits proliferation, apoptosis
  and migration/invasion in HER-2-positive cells, and inhibits apoptosis and promotes
  or inhibits proliferation and migration/invasion in TNBC cells. (B) Other PAHs and
  HAHs, endogenous and synthetic and pharmaceutical AhR ligands mainly exhibit tumor-suppressive
  characteristics. However, PAHs and HAHs not only promote the proliferation of ER-positive
  and HER-2-positive cells, but also promote the migration/invasion of TNBC and ER-positive
  cells. Endogenous ligands not only inhibit the proliferation of TNBC and ER-positive
  cells, but also inhibit the migration/invasion of TNBC and HER-2-positive cells.
  Moreover, synthetic and pharmaceutical ligands not only inhibit the proliferation
  and promote apoptosis of the different types of breast cancer cells, but also inhibit
  the migration/invasion of TNBC cells. (a) Effects of PAHs and HAHs on different
  types of breast cancer cells. (b) Effects of endogenous AhR ligands on different
  types of breast cancer cells. (c) Effects of synthetic and pharmaceutical AhR ligands
