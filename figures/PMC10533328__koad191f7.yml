caption: A working model of JA-mediated growth restriction during herbivore attack.
  Herbivore-elicited JA signaling suppresses plant growth by interacting with GA pathway.
  Both MYC2–GA2ox and JAZ–DELLA modules are involved in this process. JAZ and DELLA
  are suppressors of the JA and GA signaling pathways, respectively. PIF, phytochrome
  interacting factor.
