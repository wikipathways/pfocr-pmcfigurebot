figure_title: Analysis of proteins uniquely found in HS-EVs revealed mitochondrial
  pathways
caption: A) Biological pathways obtained through Reactome database analysis; B) Biological
  pathways identified using KEGG database; C) The oxidative phosphorylation pathway
  (OXPHOS) as the primary pathway enriched by DAPs from the HS-EV group. Interestingly,
  16 out of 18 enriched DAPs in OXPHOS are from complex I of ETC. HS-EVs, high-speed
  centrifugation isolated extracellular vesicles; AD, Alzheimer’s brain; ETC, electron
  transport chain.
