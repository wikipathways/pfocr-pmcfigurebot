caption: Functional enrichment analysis of MuSCs specific expression change of DMDmut
  and WT muscles. Dot plot representing the top four GO-BP pathways with the largest
  gene ratios in the order of gene ratio. The color gradient of dots represents the
  adjusted p values, while the size represents the number of genes in the significant
  DEG list associated with the GO-BP term
