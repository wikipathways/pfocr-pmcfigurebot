caption: RGS18 stimulates MAPK signalling. (A) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of RGS18-activated
  signalling pathways. Expression levels of ERK signalling pathway-related proteins
  in (B) MLO-Y4 and (C) MC3T3-E1 cells after overexpression or knockdown of RGS18
  were detected by western blotting. Quantitative analysis results of the expression
  of ERK signalling pathway-related proteins in (D) MLO-Y4 and (E) MC3T3-E1 cells.
  Immunofluorescence staining of p-ERK in (F) MLO-Y4 and (G) MC3T3-E1 cells (magnification,
  Ã—400). *P<0.05. ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinas; NC, negative control;
  ns, not significant; p-, phosphorylated; RGS18, regulator of G protein signalling
  18; si, small interfering
