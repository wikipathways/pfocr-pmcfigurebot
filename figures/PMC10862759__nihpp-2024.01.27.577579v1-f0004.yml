caption: A) Heatmap of T-statistic comparing activity of drug family in each cluster
  with all other samples in BeatAML1 and 2, T-statistic is report when significantly
  lower (q < 0.1; one-sided T-test). B) Boxplot comparing pathway scores (left, mid)
  and proliferation index (right) in BeatAML1. P-values is computed using ANOVA, pairwise
  p.adj with Tukeyâ€™s test (significant at p.aj < 0.1). C) Heatmap of log2FC (in BeatAML1)
  of anti-apoptotic genes in indicated comparisons (columns) and reported when significant
  (p.adj < 0.1). D) Boxplot comparing JAK-STAT activity, inferred from protein expression
  (RPPA; see Methods; two-sided T-test). E) Boxplot of drug-response AUC for pan-JAK
  inhibitors. One-sided T-test followed by FDR correction used to test for significantly
  lower AUC (q<0.1) in VR_C3-like cell lines. F) Heatmap of drug-response AUCs for
  cell lines treated with VEN, RUXO and VEN+RUXO. G) Heatmap of viability of F36P
  (left) and TF1 (right) at different concentrations of combinations of VEN (x-axis)
  and RUXO (y-axis)
