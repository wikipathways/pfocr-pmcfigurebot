figure_title: Nematodes acquired an enzyme required for L-rhamnose sugar biosynthesis
  by iHGT
caption: (A) L-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway with reaction intermediates and differences
  in the conservation of enzymes across domains of life. The presence of homologs
  of the C. elegans RML-3 enzyme and production of dTDP-L-rhamnose is unique to bacteria
  and nematodes (orange). (B) Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of RML-3 proteins
  and bacterial homologs. Relevant bootstrap branch support values greater than 90
  are indicated by asterisks or numbers. Scale bar shows the estimated divergence
  in amino acid changes per residue. A complete phylogenetic tree with support values
  is found in Supplemental File 2. (C) Schematic genomic locus architecture of RML-3
  homologs in C. elegans (RML-3) and C. perfringens (rfbC). Red carets within C. elegans
  genes represent introns. (D) Consensus sequence and positions of the predicted catalytic
  residues (yellow) for RML-3 homologs shown in (B). Four bacterial sequences are
  shown, including from three representative bacteria (Salmonella enterica, Clostridium
  perfringens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and an example from the clade of putative
  iHGT donor bacteria, Candidatus Protochlamydia sp. R18, as well as four representative
  nematode sequences. Amino acid numbering corresponds to the S. enterica and C. elegans
  proteins respectively
