caption: Identification of DD-9 as an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (a)
  Inhibitory effect of DD-9 on TOPflash/FOPflash activity in HEK293 cells. After treatment
  of HepG2 (b) and HeLa (c) cells with 5 μM DD-9 for 48 h, the levels of β-catenin
  were detected by immunocytochemical staining with FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG. Effect
  of DD-9 on nuclear β-catenin protein levels in HepG2 (d) and HeLa (e) cells. Results
  indicate the mean ± SD (n = 3) and represent data from three independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 compared with control group
