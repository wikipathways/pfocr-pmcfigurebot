  family genes.
caption: Tissue-specific expression analysis of Moso bamboo cytokinin pathway family
  genes. (A) Expression patterns of cytokinin family genes at different developmental
  stages of Moso bamboo shoots. WBS (winter bamboo shoots), 50â€“1200 represent bamboo
  shoot lengths (in cm), and CK represents bamboo with spreading leaves. (B) Expression
  patterns of different tissues of the Moso bamboo cytokinin pathway family genes.
  L (leaf), Fb (flower bud), Br (bract), Gl (glume), Pa (palea), Pi (pistil), St (stamen),
  Ye (young embryo). Lb (Lateral bud), Rt (Rhizome tip), Nst (New shoot tip)
