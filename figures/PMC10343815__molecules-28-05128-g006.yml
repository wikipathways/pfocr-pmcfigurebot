  in the NF1 cell model.
caption: Icariin activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway during osteogenic differentiation
  in the NF1 cell model. (A) Changes in intracellular cAMP levels after the 2−7 NF1
  cell model and the control group exposure for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 min. (B)
  Protein expression levels of phosphorylated PKA (p-PKA), phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB),
  total PKA, and CREB after the 2-7 NF1 cell model exposure for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60
  and 120 min. (C) The expression of p-PKA after 120 min of icariin treatment by immunofluorescence
  assays. p-PKA was stained green, and nuclei were stained blue (with DAPI). The bar
  represents the mean ± SD (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p
  < 0.0001
