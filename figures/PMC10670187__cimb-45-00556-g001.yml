caption: LncRNA MIR4435-2HG is involved in signaling pathways for cancer progression.
  MIR4435-2HG promotes c-Myc, and cyclin D expression through inhibition of DSP or
  direct activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (blue arrow). MIR4435-2HG acts as a
  sponge to absorb miR-2467-3p, promoting IQGAP3 expression and activating the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  signaling pathway (black arrow). Additionally, MIR4435-2HG increases the levels
  of p38 and JNK proteins (black arrow). By sponge-absorbing miR-2467-3p, MIR4435-2HG
  enhances CDCA5 expression, activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and promotes
  SNAI1 expression (red arrow). Moreover, Fusobacterium nucleatum may enhance the
  competitive binding of MIR4435-2HG with miR-296-5p, leading to upregulation of AKT
  protein (red arrow). MIR4435-2HG promotes TGF-β expression, activates SMAD2, increases
  N-cadherin, MMP9 and vimentin expression, while inhibiting E-cadherin expression
  (orange arrow)
