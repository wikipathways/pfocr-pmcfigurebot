caption: Schematic diagram of Src intracellular signaling pathway and various cellular
  processes controlled by each pathway. Activation of RTK, integrin signaling, or
  viral integration activates c-Src. Activated c-Src activates downstream PI3K-AKT,
  STAT3, Ras-MAPK, and FAK pathways and regulates various cellular functions required
  for normal growth and development as well as carcinogenesis and drug resistance.
  The both-way arrow indicates that the components can be activated by each other
