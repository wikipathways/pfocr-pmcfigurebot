  by EU intervention.
caption: 'PPI and TF target enrichment analysis of DEGs on key pathways influenced
  by EU intervention. (A) STRING network visualization of the DEGs on ECM–receptor
  interaction and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction. Edges represent protein–protein
  associations and the line thickness indicates the strength of data support. Genes
  associated with 7 or more proteins are identified as hub genes. (B) Heatmap of hub
  genes analyzed by RNA-seq. (C) Relative mRNA expression of MMP-1. (D) Relative mRNA
  expression of MMP-3. (E) Relative mRNA expression of MMP-9. (F) Relative mRNA expression
  of MMP-13. (G) Relative mRNA expression of IL-1β. (H) Relative mRNA expression of
  IL-6. (I) Relative mRNA expression of TNF-α. (J) Relative mRNA expression of INF-γ.
  (K) Relative mRNA expression of MCP-1. (L) Relative mRNA expression of CXCL2. (M)
  Relative mRNA expression of CXCL5. (N) Relative mRNA expression of CCL5. (O) Relative
  mRNA expression of CCL7. (P) Relative mRNA expression of BDNF. (Q) Top 10 TFs network
  generated by ChEA3 using the average integrated ranks across all libraries. (R)
  Top 10 TFs generated by ChEA3 based on Mean Rank ranking. For (C–P), data were presented
  as mean ± SEM, and significant differences between groups are indicated as: * p
  < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001. n = 5'
