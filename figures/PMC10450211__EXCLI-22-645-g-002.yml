figure_title: 'The downregulation of circular RNAs promotes lung cancer progression
  through the upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. A, B, reduced levels of circ-ITCH
  and circ-0043256 promotes aggregation of miR-7/miR-214 and miR-7/miR-1252 respectively,
  which causes ITCH reduction. Increased DVL as a result of ITCH downregulation, stabilizes
  β-catenin in cells and induces the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. C, inhibitory effect on
  miR-378 declines, by downregulation of circ-0007059 which causes ERK1/2 rise. ERK1/2
  activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by interaction with the LRP protein. D, E, a
  drop of circ-0006427 and circ-18414 expression in lung cancer cells, results in
  upregulation of miR-6783-3P and miR-6807-3P respectively, which depletes DKK1 expression
  and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. Abbreviations: ITCH, Itchy E3 Ubiquitin Protein
  Ligase; LRP, Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; DVL, Dishevelled;
  ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2; DKK1, dickkopf1'
