caption: Esc, a compound with potential anticancer properties, promotes apoptosis
  and inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells. These effects are mediated by various
  molecular mechanisms involving different signaling pathways. In the PI3K/Akt pathway,
  Esc modulates the upstream molecule, IGF-1, to regulate the PI3K/Akt pathway in
  gastric cancer cells. Esc also targets downstream mTOR molecules to induce apoptosis
  and cell cycle arrest. Esc induces G1 phase cell cycle arrest by upregulating Ras,
  ERK1/2 and p27 KIP8, and activates MAPK signaling to induce apoptosis in colon and
  bladder cancer cells. Esc also regulates NF-κB in lung cancer cells. Esc activates
  the ARE pathway in pancreatic cancer cells by disrupting the Nrf2-KEAP1 interaction.
  Esc decreased Sp1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells and enhances
  TRAIL-induced apoptosis in oral cancer cells by upregulating DR5. Esc regulates
  the JAK/STAT3 pathway in ovarian and laryngeal cancers, leading to decreased expression
  of MMP2 and MMP9. In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, Esc downregulates proteins such
  as c-Myc and cyclin D1, binds directly to β-catenin and inhibits the β-catenin/Tcf
  complex. Esc binds to hnRNPA1 in endometrial cancer, affecting Bcl-xl expression.
  These pathways highlight the diverse mechanisms through which Esc inhibits cancer
  proliferation and suggest its potential as a targeted therapy for various cancer
  types. Esc, esculetin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JAK, janus kinase;
