figure_title: Apoer2-ICD regulation of AD GWAS and Reelin signaling transcripts
caption: 'Heatmaps depicting the log2FC of ribosome-associated AD GWAS (A) or Reelin
  signaling pathway (B) transcripts between the Apoer2cKO/KI neurons expressing only
  Cre or Cre with either Apoer2-ICD compared to Apoer2WT expressing only Cre (left
  panels of A,B) or between neurons expressing either ICD[+19] or ICD[Δ19] compared
  to the Cre-only translation within each genotype (right panels of A,B). (B) Reelin
  pathway transcripts are sorted into four groups: the core Reelin receptor complex
  and associated tyrosine kinases (1), the signaling pathway regulating cadherin trafficking
  (2), the signaling pathway regulating tau (MAP1B) phosphorylation (3), and the other
  members of the canonical Reelin pathway (4). Significance is represented by the
  size of the node'
