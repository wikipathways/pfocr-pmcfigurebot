caption: Systemic sclerosis, recognized as a prototypical autoimmune disease, is intricately
  governed by a myriad of autoimmune mechanisms. Among these, the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) class I and class II play a pivotal role in the precise presentation
  of both antigens and autoantigens. Various combinations of MHC I and MHC II alleles
  have been correlated with the susceptibility to disease onset and the manifestation
  of specific disease subtypes. Antigen presentation occurs within the context of
  MHC class I and II molecules, subsequently eliciting responses from CD8 and CD4
  T cells, respectively. Co-receptor molecules, such as Ox40L for CD8 T cells, and
  CD2 and CD247 for CD4 cells, orchestrate proper co-stimulation, culminating in the
  orchestration of the final immune response. Genetic variability within the interferon
  system has been extensively documented. Commencing from genes responsible for Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) encoding, traversing through the intricate signaling cascades mediated
  by NFÎºB, and culminating in genetic variations in interferon regulatory factors.
  A multitude of cytokines are implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis,
  including those operating via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (e.g., IL-12). Genetic
  polymorphisms within genes encoding IL-12 receptor, TYK2, and STAT molecules have
  been associated with the susceptibility to systemic sclerosis development. Similar
  associations are observed concerning other cytokines such as IL1 (IRAK SNP) and
  the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (gene promoter of MIF)
