  in acinar cells
caption: '(A and B) KEGG pathway enrichment (A) and GO analysis (B) in pancreas from
  cKO and WT mice from the FAEE-SAP model. (C) The enrichment plot comparing the transcriptome
  of cKO mice and WT mice in FAEE-SAP from GSEA analysis. Normalized Enrichment Score
  (NES), –2.133; normal P value, 0.001. (D) Heatmap shows the core enrichment genes
  in the pathway named response to calcium ion. (E and F) Representative traces of
  POA (E) or POAEE (F) induced Ca2+ elevations. The representative images are the
  first and last frames of pancreas prestained with Fluo-4. Scale bar: 40 μm. KAN0438757
  (25 mg/kg) was administered by i.p. injection 1 hour prior to detection; DMSO in
  saline solution was used as a control. P values calculated using unpaired Student’s
  t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Data are shown as mean ± SD. Each experiment
  was performed at least in triplicate'
