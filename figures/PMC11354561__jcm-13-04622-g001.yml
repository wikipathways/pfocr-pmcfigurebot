caption: Schematic representation of the human intestinal microbiome. The microbiota
  is a broad concept that includes microorganisms (the microbiota), the genes and
  gene products of the microbiota, and the microenvironment. Most nutrients are digested
  and absorbed in the small intestine. However, dietary fibre remains intact until
  it reaches the colon. In the colon, a fermentation process is performed by enzymes
  produced by gut bacteria, resulting in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production,
  including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These metabolites participate in various
  cellular and immunological processes. They stimulate the production of mucins, reduce
  the intestinal permeability, and promote anti-inflammatory pathways. Among the SCFAs,
  butyrate is the main energy source for the intestinal epithelial cells and has modulator
  functions that lead to a decreased concentration of oxygen in the intestinal lumen.
  As a result, the number of obligate anaerobic bacteria, including those of the phylum
  Firmicutes, which produce butyrate, increases. Bile acids (BAs) are the end products
  of cholesterol catabolism and are released into the small intestine through the
  ampulla of Vater. They form micelles with lipid molecules and facilitate their absorption
  in the small bowel through the enterohepatic circulation. However, there is a small
  proportion of BAs that remain in the gut and is metabolised by the gut bacteria
  [11]. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that should be ingested with the diet.
  Gut bacteria convert it into tryptamine and other products. These products can function
  as endogenous ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), an essential signalling
  pathway in the maintenance of gut homeostasis [12]
