caption: Potential molecular targets of natural product-derived compounds for psoriasis
  treatment. TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-1α, Oncostatin-M, and IFN-γ promote the activation
  of STAT3, STAT1, TAK1/NF-kB, JNK, AKT, and p38 signaling systems, as well as ROS
  production. These signaling pathways and ROS production lead to inflammatory responses
  by increasing the expression or protein levels of NLRP3, caspase-3, caspase-1, and
  others in keratinocytes. They also contribute to abnormal keratinocyte proliferation
  by increasing the levels of SKP2, CEBPD, cyclin A, and cyclin D1. Piperine, shikonin,
  and genistein inhibit STAT3, while glycyrrhizin inhibits STAT3 activity through
  SIRT1 activation. Kaempferol and cudraxanthone D (Cud D) also inhibit STAT1 activity.
  Luteolin, genistein, Cud D, and liquirtin inhibit NF-kB transactivity, whereas indirubin
  inhibits NF-kB signaling by inhibiting TAK1 activity. 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T)
  and nitidine inhibit the JNK signaling pathway, a member of the MAPK signaling system,
  and indirubin and paeoniflorin inhibit p38, another signaling pathway. Leucosceptoside
  A (Leu A) inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, while Leu A and kaempferol inhibit
  ROS overproduction. Furthermore, p53 is known to inhibit excessive keratinocyte
  proliferation, and nitidine activates the p53 pathway. Sharp arrow (→) indicates
  activation, and blunt arrow (⊣) indicates inhibition
