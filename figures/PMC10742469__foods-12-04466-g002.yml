figure_title: The identified protein functions were annotated by Gene Ontology analysis
  (A) and metabolic pathway analysis (B).
caption: 'The identified protein functions were annotated by Gene Ontology analysis
  (A) and metabolic pathway analysis (B). Note: the horizontal ordinate was the protein
  number, while the vertical coordinate was the annotated GO (A) and KEGG (B) entries.
  Due to the excessive number of GO annotation results, the figure (A) only showed
  the top 10 results in each category. The green bar means Biological Process. The
  orange bar means Cellular Component. The red bar means Molecular Function'
