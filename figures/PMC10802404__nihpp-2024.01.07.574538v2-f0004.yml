figure_title: DNA methylation profiling identifies 4 subtypes of neuroblastoma that
  differ in malignant cell state composition and outcome
caption: (A) t-SNE dimension reduction of 207 neuroblastoma methylation profiles from
  the NCI TARGET cohort (n=173) or the HTAPP neuroblastoma cohort (n=34). Consensus
  clustering69 was used to delineate 4 groups of tumors plus a group of control adrenal
  samples. Samples from the HTAPP cohort are demarcated in dark red.(B) Heatmaps colored
  based on relative abundance of clinical risk factors within each methylation grouping
  from (A). Numbers within each cell correspond to the absolute number of tumors.
  p-values, Fisher exact test of independence.(C) Box plot of the proportion of malignant
  cells/nuclei within each malignant cell state, divided by methylation group. Data
  are presented as median ± interquartile range. Statistically credible differences,
  as determined by Bayesian composition analysis88 set with a false discovery < 0.05,
  are displayed as bars with an asterisk.(D and E) Validation and optimization of
  CIBERSORTx bulk deconvolution parameters derived using matched snRNA-seq and bulk
  RNA-seq data from n=33 tumors from the HTAPP cohort. (D) shows a scatterplot comparing
  proportion of cells in each malignant state within sc/snRNA-seq data (‘ground truth’)
  compared to the estimated proportion from bulk deconvolution. (E) shows the cell-type
  specific correlation between sc/snRNA-seq and bulk deconvolved data. Bars in the
  gray region meet significant criteria for concordance with ground truth as measured
  by Pearson correlation (p < 0.05)(F) Box plots of estimated malignant cell proportions
  within the NCI TARGET dataset, as estimated by CIBERSORTx bulk deconvolution of
  bulk RNA-seq data, divided by methylation grouping. Plots show proportions of cells
  that are estimated to be in the mesenchymal (top), adrenergic (middle), or sympathoblast
  (bottom) state. Data are presented as median ± interquartile range. Differences
  across groups that meet statistical significance are shown (p values; Wilcoxon rank
  sum test).(G) Kaplan-Meier curve showing overall survival of patients within the
  NCI TARGET cohort (n=175) divided by methylation grouping. p-values were calculated
  using the Mantel-Cox log rank test. Censored datapoints are represented with solid
  rectangles.(H) Schematic of the scMINER activity inference. scMINER generates cell
  type-specific gene regulatory network to infer protein activity and signaling factor
  activation.(I) Volcano plot of signaling pathway inference comparing group II MES
  cells to MES cells from the other methylation groupings.(J) HALLMARK pathway analysis
  of statistically significant results from (I)
