caption: 'Kidney-microbiome interactions revealed by analysis of reaction co-sets
  connects host (kidney) and gut microbial metabolic pathways via transport. Reaction
  co-sets provide a means of identifying functionally correlated pathways by delineation
  of groups of reactions that are linked together based upon flux correlations. The
  kidney-microbiome steady state flux space was interrogated in order to identify
  reaction co-sets involving the host as well as the microbiome, reflected as changes
  in the plasma metabolite concentrations. The illustrated central metabolic pathways
  centering around hexose and pentose sugar metabolism provide direct links between
  the host and microbiome. Links between glycolysis and the non-oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway are directly coupled via inter-organismal (host-microbiome) transport
  of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and dihydroxyacetone. Other metabolites such as xanthine
  and L-alanine are present in some but not all of the co-sets for the four models
  (Oat1WT, Oat1KO, Oat3WT, Oat3KO), reflecting the condition/context dependence of
  the co-sets. Reactions with blue names are present in all four models (reactions
  with red names are present in one, two, or three models). Abbreviations are as follows,
  with those enzymes and transporters present in the microbiome as opposed to the
  host indicated as “x_mb (microbiome)”: ALATA_L l-alanine transaminase, PSERT phosphoserine
