figure_title: Roles of D2Rs in dopaminergic and mushroom body neurons during larval
  olfactory learning
caption: '(a) A schematic diagram shows the roles of D2R in dopaminergic neurons (DAN)
  and mushroom body neurons (MBN) in larval olfactory associative learning. During
  learning, olfactory stimuli (conditioned stimulus, CS) are received by olfactory
  sensory neurons (OSN) and transmitted to MBNs (green) via projection neurons (PN).
  Distinct gustatory stimuli (unconditioned stimulus, US) are received by gustatory
  sensory neurons (GSN) and transferred to different dopaminergic neurons. Aversive
  stimuli are sent to DAN-c1 (red) in the DL1 cluster which connects the lower peduncle
  compartment (LP, square in dash line), while appetitive stimuli are received by
  pPAM neurons (blue) innervating the medial lobe (ML). D2Rs (yellow square) are expressed
  in DAN-c1 and pPAM as autoreceptors, regulating dopamine release. Both D2R and dDA1
  (magenta circle) are expressed in the MBNs. (b) A hypothetical curve showing the
  relationship between learning ability and cAMP level in the mushroom body. Insufficient
  cAMP (rutabaga mutant) cannot induce learning, while excessive cAMP (dunce mutant)
  also impairs learning. Only the appropriate level of cAMP regulated by the opposing
  actions of D1R (dDA1) and D2R leads to successful learning in wild type larvae (WT).
  Knockdown of D2R in DAN-c1 causes excessive dopamine release, elevating cAMP and
  resulting in impaired learning. D2R knockdown in MBNs relieves the inhibition effect
  of D2R, resulting in excessive intracellular cAMP and learning failure. (c-d) Potential
  molecular mechanisms underlying Drosophila olfactory learning in the square region
  shown in (a). (d) During aversive learning, olfactory stimuli induce depolarization
  of MBNs, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and induces calcium influx.
  Gustatory stimuli, such as quinine, activates dopaminergic neurons and elevates
  dopamine (DA) release. D1 receptor (dDA1) activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) and elevates
  cAMP via Gαs, while D2 receptor (D2R) inhibits AC and suppresses cAMP via Gαi/o.
  In Drosophila, the coincidence detector rutabaga (AC) is activated by the existence
  of both calcium and Gαs, converging the olfactory and gustatory stimuli. cAMP activates
  the PKA signaling pathway, elevating the neuronal excitability. D1 and D2 receptors
  can also form heteromeric receptors and activate the PLC-PKC and CaMKII signaling
  pathways via Gαq. These pathways inhibit acetylcholine (ACh) release from MBNs to
  MB output neurons (MBON), which leads to avoidance of the learned odor. Abbreviations:
