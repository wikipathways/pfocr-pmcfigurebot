  abundance scores.
caption: Volcano plot of differential metabolites and KEGG-enriched differential abundance
  scores. (A) Volcano plot. Each point represents a metabolite, where green points
  represent down-regulated differential metabolites, red points represent up-regulated
  differential metabolites, and gray points represent metabolites that were detected
  but did not significantly differ from the horizontal coordinate representative of
  the logarithm of the multiplicity of the difference in the relative abundance of
  a metabolite between the two groups of samples (log2FC). The larger the absolute
  value of the horizontal coordinate is, the larger the difference in the relative
  abundance of the substance between the two groups of samples is. (B) Differential
  abundance score plot. The vertical coordinate indicates the name of the differential
  pathway (sorted by p-value) and the horizontal coordinate indicates the differential
  abundance score (DA Score). The DA Score reflects the overall changes of all metabolites
  in the metabolic pathway and a score of 1 indicates that the expression of all identified
  metabolites in the pathway tends to be up-regulated, while a score of âˆ’1 indicates
  that the expression of all identified metabolites in the pathway tends to be down-regulated
