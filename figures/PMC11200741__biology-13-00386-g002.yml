caption: Overview of the non-canonical pathway (β-catenin-independent pathway). (A)
  Activation of the WNT/PCP pathway happens when corresponsive WNT ligands bind to
  Fz receptors and co-receptors, ROR/RYK, in the plasma membrane. This leads to the
  recruitment of Dsh proteins that activate either ROCK or JNK, which are responsible
  for cytoskeletal remodelling or further activation of the JUN transcription factor
  of target genes. (B) WNT ligands bind to Fz receptors and ROR/RYK co-receptors to
  activate membrane-bound PLC, which allows the hydrolysis of PIP2 to IP3 and DAG.
  The release of IP3 triggers Ca2+ release into the cytoplasm, activating the protein
  calmodulin. This allows calcineurin expression to be enhanced, resulting in transcription
  factor NFAT binding to promoter regions and initiating transcription of target genes
  (indicated as black arrow), associated with ventral-cell fate determination. This
