  Dupilumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IL4Rα receptor. CBP201
  is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-4Rα receptor. AK120 is an antibody
  against IL4Rα receptor. Tralokinumab and cendakimab, a fully humanized IgG4λ, bind
  to IL-13 at an epitope that overlaps with the binding site of receptors IL13Rαl
  subunit and IL13Rα2 subunit. Tezepelumab is an anti-TSLP antibody. Lebrikizumab,
  a humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody that selectively blocks IL13 and prevents heterodimerization
  of type II IL4R receptor composed of IL4Rα and IL13Rαl subunit. Eblasakimab is a
  fully humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-13Rα1 subunit, therefore
  inhibiting the signals by IL4 and IL-13. Mepolizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin
  G monoclonal antibody, binds to interleukin-5, inhibiting its activity. Benralizumab
  directly binds to the IL-5Rα chain to inhibit the signaling pathway. Nemolizumab,
  a humanized monoclonal antibody that antagonizes IL-31RA receptor. Vixarelimab,
  a first-in-class fully human monoclonal antibody that targets oncostatin M receptor.
  Fezakinumab is an anti-IL-22 monoclonal antibody. Ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and
  ivarmacitinib inhibit JAK1 and JAK2. Tofacitinib is an inhibitor of JAK1, JAK2,
  and JAK3. Delgocitinib and jaktinib are pan-jak inhibitors inhibiting JAK1, JAK2,
  JAK3, and TYK2. Brepocitinib is a selective JAK-1 and TYK-2 inhibitor. Ifidacitinib
  selectively targets JAK1 and JAK3. Upadacitinib, abrocotinib, and ivarmacitinib
  are JAK inhibitors with a higher potency for JAK-1. Gusacitinib is a dual JAK-SYK
  inhibitor. PRN473 is a covalent BTK inhibitor. Branebrutinib is a highly selective
  BTK inhibitor that covalently binds to the cysteine residue of BTK. Tapinarof is
  an AHR agonist. HC-030031 and GRC17536 are both TRPA1 antagonists. S-777469 is a
  CB2R agonist. VTP-38543 and ALX-101 are LXR-β agonists. Crisaborole, PF-07038124,
  Hemay-808, difamilast, and roflumilast are PDE4 inhibitors in topical forms, while
  apremilast and orismilast are PDE4 inhibitors in oral form. Methylbenzyl methylbenzimidazole
  piperidinyl methanone (MMP) is a selective PAR-2 inhibitor in topical form. JNJ
  39758979, adriforant, and LEO 152020 are H4R antagonists. KRO-105714 is a dual antagonist
  of sphingosylphosphorylcholine and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 in topical
  form. JTE-013 is an S1PR2 antagonist in topical form. Etrasimod, LC51-0255, and
  udifitimod are oral S1PR modulators. SCD-044 is an S1PR1 agonist. JAK1, Janus kinase
