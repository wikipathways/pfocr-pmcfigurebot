figure_title: TLR4 and the mTOR pathway are required in NET-related cholesterol reprogramming
  in naive CD4+ T cells
caption: (A) Top receptor and cytokine pathway enrichment analysis in naive CD4+ T
  cells with or without NET treatment. (B and C) Gene set enrichment analysis and
  heatmap of signature genes related in the mTOR signaling pathway. (D) Western blot
  images of TLR4/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway expression in naive CD4+ T cells. (E) Western
  blot images of SREBP2-regulated gene expression in naive CD4+ T cells. (F) The relative
  gene expression of SREBP2-regulated gene expression in naive CD4+ T cells was tested
  by qPCR. (G) iTreg differentiation assessed in NETs or vehicle-treated naive CD4+
  T cells with or without resatorvid treatment (n = 5). Each bar represents mean Â±
  95% CI. Data comparison between 2 groups was analyzed by unpaired t test. Statistical
  analysis for 3 or more groups was preformed using 1-way ANOVA. *P < 0.05, **P <
  0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001
