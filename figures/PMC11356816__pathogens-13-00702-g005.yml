caption: 'Interactions between BAs and Bacteroidetes. (A) Bacteroidetes exhibit BSH
  activity, facilitate SBA production, and alleviate colitis; (B) Bacteroides with
  high BSH gene expression will promote the massive production of SBA, which can induce
  colorectal cancer; (C) BDX-01 enhances intestinal health by modulating BA metabolism
  and the FXR-NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, thus mitigating experimental colitis.
  PBA: primary bile acid; SBA: secondary bile acid; BSH: bile salt hydrolase; FXR:
  Farnesoid X Receptor'
