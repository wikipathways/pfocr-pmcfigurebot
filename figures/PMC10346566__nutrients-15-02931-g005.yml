  pathway in HFD-fed mice.
caption: Synergistic effects of co-treatment of HTGT and EMIQ on PKA signaling pathway
  in HFD-fed mice. (A,B) Immunoblot analysis of proteins involved in PKA signaling
  in BAT (A) and iWAT (B); (C,D) The quantitative data of protein expression in BAT
  (C) and iWAT (D); (E) Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in iWAT. Statistical
  significance was assessed using the Kruskal–Wallis test. The data are presented
  as means ± SEM. n = 6. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001
