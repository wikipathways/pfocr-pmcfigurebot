caption: KEGG and GO enrichment analyses. Enrichment of METTL14-associated genes with
  (A) KEGG signaling pathways, (B) GO BP terms, (C) GO CC terms and (D) GO MF terms.
  The closer the color of the dot is to red, the smaller the P-value, and the larger
  the area of the dot, the more genes are enriched in this order. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; GO, Gene Ontology; BP, biological process; CC, cellular component;
  MF, molecular function; METTL14, methyltransferase 14
