figure_title: Schematic representation of UV-mediated signaling in cyanobacteria.
caption: 'Schematic representation of UV-mediated signaling in cyanobacteria. The
  major processes involved in signaling cascade include signal perception, transduction,
  and cellular responses: (a) different classes of UV-A sensors, signaling molecules,
  and the UV-A signaling pathways in which they are involved. GGDEF and EAL, output
  domains; MCP, methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein signaling domain; RR, response
  regulators; (b) schematic representation of UirS/UirR/LsiR-based negative UV phototaxis
  signaling pathway in cyanobacteria. Two-component system initiates phosphorelay
  cascades, which consist of transfer of a phosphate moiety in the transduction of
  the light signal. Many of the targets of the phosphorelay are response regulator
  (RR)-type molecules (modified from Moon et al. [45] and Song et al. [46])'
