caption: Model of lactate and LOX regulation of the HCAR1-RAS/PI3K signaling cascades.
  TME lactate activates HCAR1, which induces the assembly of a protein complex that
  includes the receptor itself, GRB2, SOS1, RAS, GAB1, p85, and p110Î². Subsequently,
  the RAS and PI3K pathways are activated and transduce the lactate-triggered signals,
  via phosphorylated ERK1/2 and AKT, respectively, to the downstream transcription
  factors that further mediate the transcription of the genes involved in promoting
  the signaling and cancer cell survival and growth (left panel). Introducing LOX
  to the TME depletes lactate and renders HCAR1 inactive for triggering the assembly
  of the RAS and PI3K signaling complex. The disassembled HCAR1-associated RAS and
  PI3K signaling proteins are targeted for degradation by proteasomes (right panel).
  TME, tumor microenvironment; PM, plasma membrane; TF, transcription factor; the
  criss cross lines in the right panel represent removal or loss of interaction or
  signaling
