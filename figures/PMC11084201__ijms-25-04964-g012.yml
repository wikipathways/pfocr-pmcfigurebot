figure_title: Expression levels of insulin receptors and key members of the insulin
  receptor downstream signaling pathway.
caption: 'Expression levels of insulin receptors and key members of the insulin receptor
  downstream signaling pathway. (A) Expression level of the insulin receptor protein.
  (B) Transcription level of the gene encoding the insulin receptor. (C) Expression
  levels of the key mediators in the insulin receptor signaling pathway. After the
  collection of the total proteins from the liver tissue, the expression levels of
  insulin receptor proteins IRS-1, p-IRS-1, PI3K, p-PI3K, Akt, and p-Akt were determined
  by a Western blot. The preparation of the total homogenates from the liver tissue
  was performed on five to six mice per group, and the expression levels of each protein
  were analyzed twice for each sample. After the collection of the total RNA from
  the liver tissue, the mRNA level of the gene encoding the insulin receptor was analyzed
  by RT-qPCR. The preparation of total RNA from the liver tissue was performed on
  five to six mice per group, and the transcription levels of each gene were analyzed
  twice for each tissue. The data represent the means Â± SD. * indicates p < 0.05 compared
  to the vehicle-treated group. # indicates p < 0.05 compared to the WT mice. Abbreviations:
  WT; wild type, Lep KO; leptin knockout, MPs; microplastics, RT-qPCR; reverse transcription-quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction, IRS-1; insulin receptor substrate 1, PI3K; phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase, Akt; protein kinase B'
