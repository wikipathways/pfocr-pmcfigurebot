figure_title: MTZ-resistance-related metabolic pathways in T.
caption: 'MTZ-resistance-related metabolic pathways in T. vaginalis. Resistance-related
  DEGs and their corresponding pathways connected to 5-nitroimidazole activation.
  Main energy production pathway—Pyruvate-dependent (Red), Malate-dependent (Blue);
  alternative energy production pathways (Light Green); oxygen-scavenging (antioxidant/redox)
  pathway (Gold); detoxification pathway (Purple); activation of MTZ through reduction
  (electron donation) resulting in formation of nitro radical anion and subsequent
  DNA damage. Highlighted boxes/words—proteins/enzymes with known dysregulated expression.
  Abbreviations: DEGs = differentially expressed genes'
