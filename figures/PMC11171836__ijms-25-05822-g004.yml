caption: Pin1 inhibits the AMPK/ACC1 pathway in hepatocytes under metabolic stimulation.
  (A) BODIPY 493/503 staining of OA-induced HepG2 cells (200×). (B) BODIPY staining
  of OA-induced L-02 cells (200×). (C) Western blot to verify OA-induced changes in
  major molecules in the AMPK/ACC1 signalling pathway in HepG2 cells. (D) Western
  blot to verify OA-induced changes in major molecules in the AMPK/ACC1 signalling
  pathway in L-02 cells. (E) Quantification of p-ACC1/ACC1 and p-AMPK/AMPK protein
  levels in HepG2 cells normalized to GAPDH. (F) Quantification of p-ACC1/ACC1 and
  p-AMPK/AMPK protein levels in L-02 cells normalized to GAPDH (* p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01). (G) mRNA levels of genes in the AMPK/ACC1 pathway in the OA-induced cell
  model (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01)
