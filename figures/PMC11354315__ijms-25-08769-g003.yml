caption: Rb1 treatment improved the niche function of ISCs. (A) Comparison of immunostaining
  of ileum sections with Lysozyme (Lyz) antibody. The representative sections are
  shown on the left. The scale bar is 50 μm. The numbers of Lysozyme-positive cells
  per crypt are summarized on the right. In total, 20–30 crypts were counted. n =
  6. Data are shown as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ns, non-significant by
  unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. (B) Principal component analysis (PCA) of
  ileum epithelial cells in HU and Ctrl mice (n = 3). The ileum epithelial cells were
  purified from 4-week HU or ground control mice and were subjected to RNA sequencing.
  (C) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes among various groups. (D) Gene enrichment
  analysis by GSEA of the transcriptome profiles derived from each group. NES, normalized
  enrichment score. (E) Heatmap of genes enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway
