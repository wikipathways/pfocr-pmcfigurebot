figure_title: Effect of PUR on the MAPK signaling pathway.
caption: Effect of PUR on the MAPK signaling pathway. The cells were treated with
  PUR (10, 20, and 40 μM) for 24 h, and then isolated proteins were used for Western
  blotting. Densitometry was used to determine the expression levels using the SEM
  of three independent values. The results are presented as the mean ± standard error
  of the mean (SEM). ** = p < 0.01, and *** = p < 0.001. [ERK—extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinases; pERK—phospho-extracellular-signal-regulated kinases; JNK—Jun amino-terminal
  kinases; pJNK—phospho-Jun amino-terminal kinases]
