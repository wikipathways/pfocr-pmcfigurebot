caption: COX pathway. After release by PLA2, ARA C20:4n-6 is converted into prostanoids
  with COX. It is transformed into PGH2 with either COX-1 or COX-2. Then, this prostaglandin
  is transformed into other prostaglandins (PGE2, PGD2, PGI2, and PGF2α) or TxA2 by
  the respective synthases. These lipid mediators undergo further transformations.
  TxA2 is unstable and undergoes a spontaneous transformation into TxB2. Similarly,
  PGD2 undergoes spontaneous transformation to PGJ2—this prostaglandin can then be
  transformed into 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) or Δ12-PGJ2. PGE2 can be transformed
  into PGA2, and then into PGC2 and PGB2. Prostanoids also undergo degradation. The
  figure shows an example of PGE2, which undergoes inactivation by oxidation with
  15-PGDH and reduction with PTGR1/2. PGE2 can also undergo degradation by β-oxidation
  and ω-oxidation, followed by the action of 15-PGDH and PTGR1/2. The resulting degradation
  product is PGE2, which is removed from the body. ↑—higher expression of given enzymes
  in GBM tumor relative to healthy tissue; ↓—lower expression of given enzymes in
  GBM tumor relative to healthy tissue.
