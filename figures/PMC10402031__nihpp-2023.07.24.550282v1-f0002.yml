figure_title: Shared and distinct gene expression signatures among subtypes of AD
caption: a, Heatmap colored by effect size from the AD in DS versus control differential
  gene expression analysis, with genes stratified by chromosome and by spatial region.
  Statistically significant (FDR < 0.05) genes with an absolute average log2(fold-change)
  >=0.25 in at least one region are shown. b, Stacked bar chart showing the number
  of AD in DS versus control DEGs in each spatial region stratified by chromosome.
  c, Comparison of differential expression effect sizes from early-stage AD versus
  control and AD in DS versus control. Genes that were statistically significant (adjusted
  p-value < 0.05) in either comparison were included in this analysis. Genes are colored
  blue if the direction is consistent, yellow if inconsistent, and grey if the absolute
  effect sizes were smaller than 0.05. Black line represents a linear regression with
  a 95% confidence interval shown in grey. Pearson correlation coefficients are shown
  in the upper left corner of each panel. d, Comparison of differential expression
  effect sizes from late-stage AD versus control and AD in DS versus control, layout
  as in panel (c). e, Heatmap showing the gene expression values in the snRNA-seq
  dataset of spatial DEGs shared between AD in DS and late-stage AD. f, Spatial feature
  plots of four selected DEGs (QKI, GFAP, APP, and ERBIN) in one representative sample
  from each disease group. g-h, Selected pathway enrichment results from DEGs that
  were upregulated (g) or downregulated (h) in both late-stage AD and AD in DS compared
  to controls. i-j, Selected pathway enrichment results from DEGs that were upregulated
  (i) or downregulated (j) in late-stage AD exclusively. k-l, Selected pathway enrichment
  results from DEGs that were upregulated (k) or downregulated (l) in AD in DS exclusively
