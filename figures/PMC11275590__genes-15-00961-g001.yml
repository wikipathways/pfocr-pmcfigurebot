caption: 'Human lung cancer cells, but not lung fibroblasts, accumulate PPIX. (A)
  After treatment of H460 cells with 1.0 mM ALA for 4 h, the confocal fluorescence
  images were obtained. From left to right, the panels correspond to (1) green fluorescence,
  (2) red fluorescence, and (3) superimposed green and red fluorescence images. The
  green arises from the selective labeling of mitochondria with the MitoTracker Green
  (MT green) probe (excitation wavelength, λex, at 490 nm and emission wavelength,
  λem, at 516 nm), and the red fluorescence is due to PPIX fluorescence (λex 405 nm;
  λem, 635 nm). >99%, over 99% of H460 cells accumulate PPIX. The frame for the pertinent
  image is colored in red. Scale bars represent 20 μm. (B) Gene expression patterns
  from TCGA lung cancer patients indicate an imbalanced heme biosynthetic pathway
  and enhanced heme transport. Lung epithelial cell differentiation (CAV1) and cell
  proliferation (MKI67 and PCNA related genes are plotted as controls. Statistically
  significant differences are indicated by *) [Abbreviations: DAPI, 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
