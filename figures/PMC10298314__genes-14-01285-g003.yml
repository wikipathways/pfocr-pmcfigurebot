caption: The characterization of DEGs, pathways, MPP signatures, and immune microenvironments
  between S1 and S2 groups. (a) The heatmap of NMF clustering based on AD patients.
  (b) The volcano plot of DEGs between S1 and S2 groups. (c) The functional annotation
  analysis of DEGs by hallmark pathways. ORA has been used to calculate the enrichment
  level of HALLMARKS from DEGs. (d) MPP signature-based clustering of the metaGEO
  dataset showed that DEGs significantly correlated with metabolism, nervous system,
  and immunity among S1, S2, and non-AD groups. (e) The functional annotation analysis
  of DEGs by the KEGG database. GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) has been used
  to evaluate the enrichment of gene sets in KEGG. The red circle represents upregulation
  of the gene, while the blue circle represents downregulation of the gene. (f) The
  functional annotation analysis of DEGs by the GO database. GSEA has been used to
  evaluate the enrichment of gene sets in GO. The red circle represents upregulation
  of the gene, while the blue circle represents downregulation of the gene. (g) The
  core metabolic network of significantly differential MPP signatures. We selected
  the top 10 metabolic pathways ranked by the MCC algorithm and their neighbors. Hub
  nodes are also labeled by red, and the nodes with a deeper color have a higher rank.
  Green nodes indicate adjacency nodes between hub nodes. (h) The heatmap of differential
  MPP signatures, which we selected from all available ones between the S1 and S2
  groups. (i) The immune infiltration analysis shows the profiles of infiltrating
  immune cell types between the S1 and S2 groups. (j) The boxplot of metabolic pathways
  between S1 and S2 groups. hsa00592, α-Linolenic acid metabolism; hsa00982, drug
  metabolism by cytochrome P450; hsa01040, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids;
  hsa00534, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis by heparan; hsa00780, biotin metabolism;
  hsa00980, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome; hsa00512, mucin type O-glycan
  biosynthesis; hsa00051, fructose and mannose metabolism; hsa00760, nicotinate and
  nicotinamide metabolism; hsa00062, fatty acid elongation. The labeled asterisk indicated
  the statistical p values (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001)
