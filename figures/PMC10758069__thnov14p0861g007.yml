figure_title: SGK3/Nedd4-2 signaling pathway prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation
  of Pit-1.
caption: SGK3/Nedd4-2 signaling pathway prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation of
  Pit-1. Mice were modeled with CKD by 5/6 nephrectomy and fed high phosphate diet.
  A. The protein levels of phospho-Nedd4-2 (P-Nedd4-2) and Nedd4-2 in the aorta were
  measured by western blot. **P < 0.01, vs. Sham+NP group. B-D. Mouse VSMCs treated
  with 3 mM Pi (B), or transfected with SGK3-S486D plasmid (C) and SGK3 siRNA (D)
  for 48 h. The protein levels of P-Nedd4-2 and Nedd4-2 were measured by western blot.
  E. Mouse VSMCs transiently transfected with Nedd4-2 siRNA for 48 h. The protein
  levels of Pit-1 and Nedd4-2 were measured by western blot. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
  vs. the control group. F. Mouse VSMCs transiently transfected with Nedd4-2 siRNA
  for 48 h and followed by MG132 treatment for the last 8 h. Ubiquitination assay
  were precipitated with an anti-Pit-1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed
  with western blot using anti-Pit-1 and anti-ubiquitin (Ub) antibodies. G-H. The
  HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 48 h. Ubiquitination
  assay (G) and Co-IP analysis (H) were precipitated with an anti-Pit-1 antibody and
  the immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-Nedd4-2, anti-Pit-1, anti-ubiquitin
  (Ub), anti-SGK3 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. I. Mouse VSMCs were transfected with
  Nedd4-2 siRNA and without or with additional treatment 3 mM Pi for 7 days. Representative
  original images showing Alizarin Red S staining. J. Mouse VSMCs transiently transfected
  with Nedd4-2 siRNA for 48 h, in presence or absence of high Pi. The protein levels
  of Nedd4-2, Pit-1 and RUNX2 were measured by western blot. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 vs. control group; △P < 0.05, △△P < 0.01, △△△P < 0.001 vs. Pi group
