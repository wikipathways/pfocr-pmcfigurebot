  pathway in RECs and P-NF-κB p65 cellular localization.
caption: |-
  Effects of concentrations varying of SP on LPS-induced NF-κB signaling pathway in RECs and P-NF-κB p65 cellular localization. (A) WB protein bands of P-NF-κB p65, P-IκBα, NF-κB p65, IκBα in RECs treated with 10 μg/mL LPS and 15, 25, 35 mM SP and 10 μM PDTC; (B,C) phosphorylation intensities of NF-κB p65 and IκBα; (D) effect of 10 μg/mL LPS, 35 mM SP and 10 μM PDTC on P-NF-κB p65 cellular localization in RECs. The red light represents P-NF-κB p65, and the blue light represents the nucleus. ##
  p < 0.01, ** p < 0.01, # was LPS group vs. control group, * was SP (15, 25, 35 mM) group or PDTC group vs. LPS group. N = 5 in each group
