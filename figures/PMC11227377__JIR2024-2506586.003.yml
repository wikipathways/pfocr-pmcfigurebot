caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of human macrophages 8-hr exposed to 12,13-diHOME
  and peanut (Pnut) allergen identifies pathways associated with inflammatory polarization.
  Pathways exclusively enriched in (a) 12,13-diHOME vs. DMSO (left) or 12,13-diHOME + Pnut
  vs. DMSO (right) treated macrophages. (b) Pathways enriched in both 12,13-diHOME
  vs. DMSO and 12,13-diHOME + Pnut vs. DMSO. NES, normalized enrichment score. Positive
  and negative NES indicate upregulated and downregulated pathways, respectively.
  (c) Cytokines and inflammatory response pathways induced by 12,13-diHOME. Genes
  in orange and blue show relatively higher and lower expression, respectively
