figure_title: Impairment of the ERK signaling pathway in Irp1–/– testes
caption: (A–E) Protein expression changes of various signaling proteins were analyzed
  by Western blotting. (A) The experimental workflow is shown (created in BioRender.com).
  Levels of targeted proteins (TLR4, p-ERK, total ERK, p-p38, p38, p-p65, and p65)
  are shown. (B) The band intensities of p-ERK, p-p38, and p-p65 were quantified using
  ImageJ and normalized to the corresponding loading control (n = 6). FC, fold change.
  (C) BMDMs from WT, Irp1–/–, and Irp2–/– mice were isolated and treated with 200
  ng/mL LPS for different time points (20, 40, and 60 minutes; see Supplemental Figure
  4) under 6% O2 at 37°C. Extracted proteins from isolated BMDMs were analyzed by
  Western blotting. Representative blots from 3 independent experiments are shown
  (each experiment is a pool of 2 to 3 animals). (D and E) Quantitative analysis was
  performed as described above. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance
  was determined using 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test. *P < 0.05;
  ***P < 0.001
