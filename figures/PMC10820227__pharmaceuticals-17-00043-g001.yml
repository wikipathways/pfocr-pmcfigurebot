caption: Network Pharmacology Analysis of anti-CRC mechanism of ISL. (A) Venn diagram
  of the overlapping target genes of ISL and CRC. (B) The PPI network of common targets.
  (C) ISL-target-CRC network. The green node represents CRC, the orange nodes represent
  common targets, and the red node represents ISL. Larger node sizes and darker colours
  indicate a higher degree of correlation. (D) GO functional annotation of potential
  targets of ISL against CRC, including biological processes (BP), cellular components
  (CC) and molecular functions (MF). (E) KEGG enrichment analysis for potential signalling
  pathways. The top 20 pathways with lower p-values are visualised
