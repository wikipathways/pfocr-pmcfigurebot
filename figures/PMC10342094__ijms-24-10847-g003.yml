figure_title: Obesity associated with differential immune cell transcriptome.
caption: Obesity associated with differential immune cell transcriptome. CD8+ and
  CD14+ PBMCs sorted from matched patient samples (Figure 2) with metabolomics (obese
  n = 2, normal weight n = 4) and utilized for RNA-sequencing. Obesity is associated
  with differential transcriptional profile in both (A) CD8+ and (B) CD14+ cells of
  patients, with a larger number of significantly differentially expressed genes (red,
  adj. p < 0.05 and |logFC| > 1.5) in the CD8+ cells. (C) Prostaglandin pathway is
  highly upregulated transcriptionally (red triangles), largely driven by upregulation
  of PTGS2, in the Obese patients as compared to the non-obese patient’s CD14+ sorted
  T-cells. (D) The urea pathway is highly upregulated transcriptionally in the Obese
  patients as compared to the non-obese patient’s CD8+ sorted T-cells, largely driven
  by LDH, transcriptionally. (E) The PD-L1 response pathway is differentially dysregulated
  in CD8+ (left) and CD14+ (right) cells of obese as compared to non-obese patients,
  with a large number of decreased (blue triangle) transcripts in the CD8+ cells associated
  with obesity as compared to normal weight patients. Whereas, in CD14+ cells, there
  are a large number of increased (red triangle) transcripts associated with obesity,
  as compared to normal weight samples
