caption: Analysis of DEGs involved in ABA and GA biosynthesis and signal transduction
  in leaves under osmotic stress. (a,b) The key enzymes and expression patterns of
  DGEs in the ABA biosynthesis and signal transduction. (c,d) The key enzymes and
  expression patterns of DGEs in the GA biosynthesis and signal transduction. The
  green-labeled genes represent down-regulated DGEs, while the pink-labeled genes
  represent up-regulated DGEs. The color spectrum of heat map ranging from white to
  red represents Log2FC values from low to high, |Log2FC| â‰¥ 1. Schemes were adapted
  from KEGG (ko00906, ko00904, ko04075). The dashed lines represent participation,
  the dashed boxes represent pathway, the solid lines in (a,c) represent synthesis,
  the solid lines in (b,d) represent signal transduction
