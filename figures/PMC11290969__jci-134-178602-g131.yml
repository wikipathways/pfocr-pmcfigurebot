figure_title: IL-21–mediated CXCR6 upregulation is required for the recruitment of
  CD4 cells to the peripheral nerves
caption: '(A) Flow cytometric analysis of CXCR6 expression on CD4+ Tph cells from
  IL-21R–sufficient versus IL-21R–deficient NOD.AireGW/ sciatic nerves (n = 6). **P
  < 0.01, by 2-tailed unpaired t test. (B) CellChat analysis of ligand-receptor interactions
  shows upregulation of the CXCL signaling pathway. (C) Relative contribution of chemokine
  ligands and corresponding receptors in the sciatic nerves of NOD.AireGW/ mice. (D)
  Expression of CXCL16 in infiltrated immune cell subsets. Highest expression was
  seen in macrophages (Mac) and cDCs. (E) Immunostaining for CXCL16 in peripheral
  nerves of NOD.WT and NOD.AireGW/ neuropathic mice. Scale bar: 20 μm'

  cells drives inflammatory neuropathy
