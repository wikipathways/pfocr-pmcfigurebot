caption: Mechanism of antioxidative stress after supplementation with polyphenolic
  overdoses. Many antioxidants lead to the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes,
  which dramatically decreases the ROS signaling pathway. As a result, the induction
  of an inflammatory response, carcinogenesis and instability in the cell redox balance
  are observed, all of which are collectively determined as antioxidative stress
