figure_title: Proposed mechanism of NO-induced proliferation in HNSCC cells.
caption: Proposed mechanism of NO-induced proliferation in HNSCC cells. NO promotes
  proliferation via glycolysis and non-glycolysis mechanisms in HNSCC cell lines.
  NO induces HN18 cell proliferation by upregulating GLUT1 and 2 gene expression and
  increasing HK activity and lactate amount. NO increases GLUT2, GLUT3 and GLUT4 gene
  expression in HN17 and HN30 cells. The crosstalk between the EGFR signaling pathway
  and glycolysis may contribute to cell proliferation. Dashed lines indicate hypothesized
  mechanism. HK, hexokinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
  EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; HNSCC,
  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; GLUT, glucose transporter
