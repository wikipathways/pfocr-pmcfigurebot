caption: 'Significance of BCMA signaling pathway in plasma cells: BAFF and APRIL are
  two natural ligands for BCMA. APRIL can bind with both TACI and BCMA and has a higher
  binding affinity with BCMA than BAFF. BAFF is a ligand for BAFF-R and can also bind
  with BCMA. The binding of APRIL and BAFF with BCMA results in the activation of
  different pathways in MM cells, like AKT, P38, NF-kβ, and JNK. γ-secretase can cleave
  the BCMA membrane and release sBCMA, which can also bind with BAFF and APRIL'
