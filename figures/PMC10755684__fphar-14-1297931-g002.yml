caption: 'Potential mechanisms of enteric gliosis. Noxious events, including surgical
  trauma and bowel surgery, produce enteric dysbiosis and activation of the IL-1 receptor,
  which induces a reactive phenotype of enteric glial cells (EGCs), a process called
  enteric gliosis. EGCs release cytokines, chemokines, and colony-stimulating factors
  1 and 3 (CSF1, CSF3), key elements modulating macrophage activation. The crosstalk
  between EGCs and macrophages is crucial to enteric neuroinflammation and visceral
  afferent nerve hyperactivity. Vagal afferent neurons (VAN) are the primary enteric
  nociceptive neurons that integrate gut signaling and connect VAN via the vagus nerve
  to the NST in the brainstem. Enteric dysbiosis modulates inflammation in the afferent
  vagal nerve and the transmission of noxious information from the gut to the brain,
  contributing to central sensitization. The visceral nociceptive neurons and VAN
  hyperactivity also induce nociceptor sensitivity in the peripheral nervous system.
  Surgical trauma triggers the release of ATP, which ultimately binds to purinergic
  receptors (P2XR). This signaling pathway represents another factor responsible for
  the visceral hypersensitivity and chronic abdominal pain associated with enteric
  gliosis. Gliotransmitter release activates the mesenteric plexus enteric nociceptive
  neurons and TRVP1 sensory neurons. Nociceptor activation and the release of immunoinflammatory
  mediators may persistently elevate for weeks or months, leading to the transition
  to chronic or neuropathic pain. BBB: brain blood barrier; CSF1: colony-stimulating
  factor 1; CSF3: colony-stimulating factor 3; EGCs: enteric glial cells; NST: nucleus
  solitary tract; P2X2: purinergic 2 × 2 receptor; TRVP1: transient receptor potential
  vanilloid receptor.'
