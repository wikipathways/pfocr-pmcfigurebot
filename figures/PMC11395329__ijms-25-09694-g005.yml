caption: 'miR-27a-5p mimic downregulates proinflammatory cytokines via the NF-κB pathway
  in LPS-stimulated rat dental pulp tissue ex vivo. (a) Freshly extracted rat incisor
  dental pulp tissue was transfected with miR-27a-5p mimic or NC for 24 h and then
  stimulated with 200 ng/mL LPS for 4 h. MiR-27a-5p expression was measured by RT-qPCR
  to verify the transfection efficiency (mean ± SD, n = 4). (b) Western blot analysis
  of NF-κB p65 (RELA) phosphorylation with GAPDH serving as the internal control (mean
  ± SD, n = 3). (c) mRNA expression of Il6 and Mcp1 measured by RT-qPCR (mean ± SD,
  n = 4). (d,g,j) mRNA expression of Tab1, Irak4, and Rela measured by RT-qPCR (mean
  ± SD, n = 4). (e,h,k) Western blot analysis of Tab1, Irak4, and Rela with GAPDH
  serving as the internal control (mean ± SD, n = 3). (f,i,l) Immunofluorescence analysis
  of TAB1, IRAK4, and RELA. Scale bars = 5 μm. **** p < 0.0001; *** p < 0.001; **
  p < 0.01; * p < 0.05. LPS: lipopolysaccharide; hDPCs: human dental pulp cells; NC:
  miRNA mimic Negative Control #1; miR-27a: miRNA mimic for miR-27a-5p'
