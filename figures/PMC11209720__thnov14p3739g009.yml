caption: 'Transcriptome high-throughput sequencing was used to study the effect of
  the 2Mg@PEG-PLGA gel on osteoporotic bone defect repair. (A) Schematic diagram of
  the RNA sequence analysis of extracted tissues within femoral bone defects from
  the control and 2Mg@PEG-PLGA groups at 4 weeks. (B) Volcano plot of genes that were
  differentially expressed between the control and 2Mg@PEG-PLGA groups. (C) Representative
  KEGG pathways associated with genes that were significantly differentially expressed
  between the control and 2Mg@PEG-PLGA groups. (D) Differentially expressed genes
  involved in the TNF-α signaling pathway. (E) IF images of TNF-α protein expression
  in femoral bone defects at 4 weeks. The white dotted lines mark the bone defects.
  Red fluorescence: TNF-α; blue fluorescence: DAPI. (F) Schematic illustration of
  the mechanism by which 2Mg@PEG-PLGA downregulates osteoclastogenesis and inflammation
  by inhibiting the TNF-α signaling pathway.'
