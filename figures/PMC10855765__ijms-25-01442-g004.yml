figure_title: Effect of hypoxia on the proliferation of yak AT2 cells.
caption: Effect of hypoxia on the proliferation of yak AT2 cells. (A) Diagram of the
  air-liquid culture model. (B–E) Protein expression of HIF-1α, EGF, and EGFR was
  measured after AT2 cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 12, 24, 36, 48,
  and 60 h. (n = 3). (F) The STRING database was used to retrieve the targeting relationship
  between HIF-1a and EGFR signaling pathway factors. (G,H) Protein expression of PCNA
  was measured after AT2 cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 12, 24, 36,
  48, and 60 h. (n = 3). (I,J) After AT2 cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia
  for 12, 36, and 60 h, the expression of Ki67 and the number of positive cells were
  detected by immunofluorescence. (n = 6). Microscope magnification is 20×. Data are
  means ± SD. ns stands for no difference, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
