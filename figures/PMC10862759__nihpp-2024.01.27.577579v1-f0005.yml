caption: 'A) Pathway activity of nutrient transport pathways in BeatAML1 with differential
  activity across VRS (ANOVA followed by FDR correction, significant at q < 0.1).
  B) Heatmap of spearman correlation coefficients between metabolic pathways (rows)
  and the PI3K-mTOR signaling axis (columns) in BeatAML1. q-values after FDR correction
  across each column reported in cells, (significance at q < 0.1 C) Heatmap of spearman
  correlation coefficients between activity of metabolic pathways (rows) and drug-response
  AUCs in BeatAML1. p-values corrected by FDR for each drug (significant q < 0.1)
  D) Boxplot of drug-response AUC for CDK inhibitors. One-sided T-test followed by
  FDR correction used to test for significantly lower AUC (q<0.1) in VR_C1-like cell
  lines E) Heatmap of drug-response AUCs for cell lines treated with VEN, SNS-032
  and VEN+SNS-032 (left) and corresponding boxplots (right) (two-sided T-test). F)
  Functions enriched (p < 0.01 and q < 0.05) of genes over and under-expressed (see
  Methods) in SNS-032 treated MOLT4 cells relative to vehicle (DMSO) treated cells.
  Note: GO_TA (gene ontology transport activity), H (Hallmark), Progeny indicate the
  pathway dataset used to compute pathway activity (Figure 5A)'
