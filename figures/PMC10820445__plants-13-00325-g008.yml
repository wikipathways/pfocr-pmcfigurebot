figure_title: Regulatory pathway of aluminum poisoning in peanut roots.
caption: Regulatory pathway of aluminum poisoning in peanut roots. (I) Oxidative damage;
  (II) osmotic control; (III) antioxidase-related genes; (IV) hormone-related genes;
  (V) genes related to ion transport; (VI) antioxidant enzyme activity; (VII) hormone
  content; (VIII) absorption of mineral nutrients. Small red arrows indicated the
  increased content of substances or the increased activity of enzymes. The small
  green arrows indicated decreased enzyme activity, reduced substance content, or
  inhibition
