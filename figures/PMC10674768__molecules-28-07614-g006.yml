caption: SHCBP1 knockdown enhanced the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on B16 cell
  proliferation through ERK signaling pathway. Four experimental groups were set up.
  No load + dimethyl sulfoxide (Vector + DMSO), no load + resveratrol (Vector + Res),
  knockdown + dimethyl sulfoxide (siSHCBP1 + DMSO), knockdown + resveratrol (siSHCBP1
  + Res). (A,B) B16 cells were treated with resveratrol and cell proliferation rate
  was measured by EDU. ** p < 0.01. (Câ€“G) After SHCBP1 knockdown, B16 cells were treated
  with resveratrol for 48 h and Western blotting was used to detect the expression
  of SHCBP1, Cycling1, p21, p-ERK and other proteins. ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001,
  n = 3
