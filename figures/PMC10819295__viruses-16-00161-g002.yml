figure_title: Possible signaling pathways activated by ORF8.
caption: Possible signaling pathways activated by ORF8. ORF8 accessory protein can
  act through IL-17 RA (left), TLR 3 (left, center), TLR 7,8,9 (center), or TLR 2,4,5
  (right). In the IL-17 RA cascade, ORF8 leads to IkB/P65 phosphorylation, causing
  degradation of IκΒα and subsequent activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Recognition
  of ORF8 by TLRs activates TRIF and/or MyD88 pathways, enhancing gene transcription
  of NF-κB genes or pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6
