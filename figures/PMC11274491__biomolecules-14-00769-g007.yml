figure_title: Proposed scheme for the anti-angiogenic activities of PZ-DHA.
caption: 'Proposed scheme for the anti-angiogenic activities of PZ-DHA. PZ-DHA inhibits
  angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubule
  formation. The antiproliferative effects of PZ-DHA on endothelial cells are mediated
  through Rho GTPase-driven G1 arrest through the p53-p21 axis, as well as inhibition
  of upstream and downstream components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. PZ-DHA
  inhibits endothelial cell migration and differentiation by inhibiting VEGF-induced
  activation of small molecular Rho GTPase and activation of PDK1, cyclin D3, and
  mTOR. Akt: protein kinase B; AP: activator protein; Cdc42, Rac1/2/3, and RhoA: Rho
  family small GTPases; CRE: cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) response element;
  CREB: cAMP response element binding protein; GSK3-β: glycogen synthase kinase 3-β;
  mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; p21: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1; PDK1:
  phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3: phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog;
  PZ-DHA: phloridzin docosahexaenoate; ROCK: Rho-associated protein kinase; RTK: receptor
  tyrosine kinase; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR2: vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor'
