figure_title: Illustrates the apoptosis mechanisms triggered by DHA.
caption: 'Illustrates the apoptosis mechanisms triggered by DHA. (A) DHA induces modifications
  in the plasma membrane environment through various pathways. (1) It increases the
  expression of SDC-1 via PPARγ, (2) inhibits the Akt-mTOR axis by upregulating PPARγ
  and PTEN, downregulates the Akt/NFκB cell survival axis, (3) EGFR/STAT3/cyclin D1/survivin
  and (4) NF-κB/IκBα/cyclin D1/survivin pathways, (5) activates the ERK/JNK/p38 axis,
  stimulates AMPK, and downregulates the PI3K/Akt pathway. (6) EPA also leads to increased
  ROS production, activates the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway, and induces the expression
  of OSGIN1. The downregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, GSH, and SOD contributes
  to the accumulation of intracellular ROS. Furthermore, (7) EPA activates ER stress
  through the expression of XBP1, PERK, ATF4, ATF6, and phosphorylated EIF2a. These
  events collectively induce intrinsic apoptosis by triggering the depolarization
  of the mitochondrial membrane. (8) This is achieved through the downregulation of
  Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, upregulation of Bax and Bcl-xS, and dimerization of Bax and Bak
  (9) Consequently, MOMP occurs, leading to the release of Smac/Diablo and cytochrome
  c from the mitochondria. Activated caspase-9 and -3/7 further execute apoptosis
  by cleaving PARP and forming DNA adducts. DHA downregulates XIAP, cIAP1, and survivin.
  (B) On the other hand, (10) DHA triggers the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis by increasing
  the expression of death receptors such as TRAIL, TNFR, DR4, and FAS. Subsequently,
  (11) DHA activates FADD and downregulates FLIP. Moreover, DHA sensitizes the apoptotic
  response to death ligands such as TNF-α, FAS antibody, and TRAIL. Additionally,
  (12) DHA induces nuclear accumulation of Foxo3a, which binds to the miR-21 promoter,
  leading to its transcriptional repression and increased TNFα mRNA levels. These
  events ultimately activate caspase 8 and executioner caspases, promoting apoptosis.
  (C) (13) Both EPA and DHA demonstrate crosstalk between the intrinsic and extrinsic
  apoptotic pathways through tBid. These findings highlight the multifaceted apoptotic
  mechanisms induced by DHA, involving both direct and indirect pathways, and emphasize
  its potential as a safe and effective option for cancer treatment. DHA: Docosahexaenoic
