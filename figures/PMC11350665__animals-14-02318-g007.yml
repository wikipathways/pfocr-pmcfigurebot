figure_title: Main biological pathway responses to acute Cd exposure in oysters.
caption: Main biological pathway responses to acute Cd exposure in oysters. The blue
  boxes represent four core Cd exposure response pathways. The orange boxes represent
  DEMs associated with the main pathways. The green boxes represent downregulated
  DEGs related to the main pathways. The red elliptical frames represent upregulated
  DEGs associated with the main pathways
