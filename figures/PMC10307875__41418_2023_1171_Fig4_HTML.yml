figure_title: CircRILPL1 activates the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway
caption: A The effect of circRILPL1 on the expression level of key proteins of the
  Hippo signaling pathway was examined by western blotting in NPC cells. B The stability
  of YAP protein was measured in NPC cells after overexpression of circRILPL1. Cells
  were treated with cycloheximide (CHX, 50 μg/mL) for 0, 4, 8, 12 h and western blotting
  was used to measure the expression of YAP protein. The experiments were repeated
  three times. C The effect of circRILPL1 on the ubiquitination level of YAP protein
  was detected in NPC cells treated with MG132 for 12 h after overexpression of circRILPL1
  plasmid for 48 h. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-YAP
  antibody followed by western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody. D The interaction
  between YAP and 14-3-3 proteins in NPC cells after overexpression of circRILPL1
  was detected by immunoprecipitation using anti-14-3-3 antibody, followed by western
  blotting using YAP antibody. GAPDH was used as a negative control. E The abundance
  of YAP protein in nucleus and cytoplasm was examined in NPC cells after overexpression
  or knockdown of circRILPL1. PARP was used as a nuclear marker and β-tubulin as a
  cytoplasmic marker. F The result of CTGF luciferase reporter assay showed that circRILPL1
  increased the transcriptional activity of YAP in NPC cells. Data were presented
  as the means ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001.
