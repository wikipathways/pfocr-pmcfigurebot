caption: 'Protein expression of the important players of the NF-κB signaling pathway
  in the liver of animals with low-grade persistent inflammatory state after one (1)
  week after intravenous application of PEI-MNPs. Experimental groups: “+/+”: animals
  with low-grade persistent inflammation state (subcutaneous injection of zymosan,
  3 times 18 µg/kg body weight) and with intravenous injection of PEI-MNPs (50 µmol
  Fe/kg body weight, 700 µg PEI per mg iron); “−/−”: animals without low-grade persistent
  inflammation state and without intravenous injection of PEI-MNPs; “−/+”: animals
  without low-grade persistent inflammation state but with intravenous injection of
  PEI-MNP; “+/−”: animals with low-grade persistent inflammation state but without
  intravenous injection of PEI-MNP. Protein expression normalized to the housekeeping
  cellular protein β-actin. NF-κB nuclear factors in red, regulators in green and
  effector proteins in blue. Data are plotted as mean and standard deviation of the
  mean, n = 5 animals per group, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 (Mann–Whitney U test)'
