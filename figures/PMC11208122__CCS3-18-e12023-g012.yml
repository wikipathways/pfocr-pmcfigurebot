caption: 'Effect of scutellarin on protein expression and fluorescence intensity of
  apoptosis in LPS‐induced BV‐2 microglial cells. (A, B) Western bolt bands and quantitative
  statistical plots. (C, D) Immunofluorescence images and quantitative statistics.
  The target factor (red), lectin (green), is a marker for microglia, and DAPI (blue)
  shows nuclei. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 between control and LPS groups;
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 between LPS and LPS + S groups. Scale bar = 50 μm. Values
  represent the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments.'
