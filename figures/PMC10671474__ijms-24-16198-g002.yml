figure_title: Common mechanisms of secondary endocrine resistance in advanced ER+
  breast cancer.
caption: 'Common mechanisms of secondary endocrine resistance in advanced ER+ breast
  cancer. Aberrant activation of RTKs (HER2, IGFR1, FGFR, EGFR) by mutations or amplifications
  leads to activation of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways. NF1 loss-of-function
  mutations result in constitutively active RAS leading to downstream activation of
  both PI3K and MAPK pathways. PI3K and MAPK pathways activation induces ER phosphorylation
  and ligand-independent activation leading to transcription of ER-regulated genes
  despite estrogen blockade with endocrine therapy. Targeting upstream activation
  of RTKs (FGFR inhibition) or downstream oncogenic proteins of the PI3K pathway (AKT
  inhibition) and MAPK pathway (ERK inhibition) provides therapeutic options that
  can potentially overcome secondary endocrine resistance when combined with antiestrogen
  therapy. Point mutations of ER (ESR1 mutations) are another common mechanism of
  endocrine resistance rendering aromatase inhibitors ineffective. Oral SERDs ± targeted
  therapies present as an effective treatment option in ESR1 mutated tumors. CERANs,
  SERCAs, ShERPAs, and PROTACs are novel agents with therapeutic potential to overcome
  resistance to traditional endocrine therapies and are under development. NOTCH signaling
  upregulation has been shown to promote breast cancer stem-like cell expansion and
  its pharmacologic disruption can lead to reversal of resistance to antiestrogen
  therapy. AURKA overactivation has been linked to downregulation of estrogen receptors
  leading to endocrine resistance and worse prognosis. Novel agents targeting AURKA
  are being investigated as a potential therapeutic approach to overcome endocrine
  resistance. Abbreviations: AURKA, aurora kinase A; BRAF, v-raf murine sarcoma viral
