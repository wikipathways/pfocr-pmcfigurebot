figure_title: Role of ghrelin in promotion of ADMSCs cardiomyocyte differentiation.
caption: Role of ghrelin in promotion of ADMSCs cardiomyocyte differentiation. Ghrelin
  promotes differentiation of ADMSCs into cardiomyocyte via activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. DDX17, an upregulated differentially expressed gene after ghrelin treatment,
  promotes nuclear translocation of β-catenin and inhibits protein expression of SFRP4.
  DDX17 is involved in ghrelin-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation of ADMSCs, which
  is associated with regulation of the SFRP4/Wnt/β-catenin axis. ADMSC, adipose tissue-derived
