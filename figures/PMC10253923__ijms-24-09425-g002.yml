figure_title: Transcriptome analysis of HaCaT cells after sericin peptide library
  treatment.
caption: 'Transcriptome analysis of HaCaT cells after sericin peptide library treatment.
  (A) The gene expression level FPKM was selected to evaluate the Pearson correlation
  analysis between samples. (B) Analysis of gene expression of the normalized sample.
  (C) The density distribution curve of gene expression. The differentiated areas
  are marked in pink. (D) Volcano map of gene expression differences between Null
  and Ser-P group. Dots with red, green, and black represent upregulated, downregulated,
  and not significantly changed genes assessed by hard thresholds, which have two
  standards: |log2FC| > 1 and −log10 p value > 1.3. (E) Hierarchical clustering heat
  map of differential genes between Null and Ser-P group. The columns and rows represent
  the different samples and different expressed genes, respectively. (F) Top 20 of
  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. TGF-β signaling pathway related to extracellular
  matrix synthesis is marked with a red dotted box. UM proteolysis refers to ubiquitin-mediated
  proteolysis. (G) Gene upregulating expression in classical TGF-β pathway in Ser-p
  group. All experiments were conducted with three independent replicates and data
  were expressed as log10 (FPKM)'
