caption: 'Revealing the underlying mechanisms of CBD’s anti-inflammatory effects.
  (A) Heatmap of DGEs in CBD-treated Aβ1–42-induced mice and Aβ1–42-induced mice.
  (B) Volcano plot of differentially expressed GO pathways in CBD-treated Aβ1–42-induced
  mice compared to Aβ1–42-induced mice. (C) Heatmap of the result of GSVA in CBD-treated
  Aβ1–42-induced mice and Aβ1–42-induced mice. (D) Sankey image showing the result
  of the gene expression related to the inflammation pathways. (E) Quantified image
  showing the mRNA expression levels of genes in the negative regulation of respiratory
  bursts involved in the inflammatory response pathway. (F) Quantified image showing
  the mRNA expression level of genes in the positive regulation of the neuroinflammatory
  response pathway. Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 3). * p < 0.05 vs. sham+Veh
  group; # p < 0.05 vs. AD+Veh group, ns: not significant'
