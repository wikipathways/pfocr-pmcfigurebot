figure_title: KEGG pathways enriched by identified hub genes
caption: The left panel showing the identified hub genes, connected with their corresponding
  KEGG pathway. The cAMP signaling pathway is the main altered pathway including,
  5 of 10 identified hub genes; however, other pathways are enriched almost by two
  or three genes. GAD1/GAD2 showed to be involved in most of the identified pathways.
  The right panel shows the gene ratio for each enriched pathway. Dot size and color
  indicate gene count and log10 p-values for each enriched pathway
