caption: 'Construction of PPI networks and identification of candidate hub proteins.
  (A,C). PPI network analysis in both the COVID-19(+) and HCC groups. In COVID-19(+),
  the PPI network consisted of 102 nodes and 281 edges, while in HCCs the PPI network
  consisted of 195 nodes and 610 edges, all of them were visualized in Cytoscape.
  A comprehensive view of the PPI network is illustrated in  for both the COVID-19(+)
  and the HCC groups, respectively. (B,D) Top ten ranked proteins in network analysis
  with the MCC method in cytoHubba in COVID-19(+) and HCC, respectively. The top ten
  nodes are shown with a color scheme from red (highly important) to yellow (very
  important). (E) STRING PPI of hub proteins in the COVID-19(+) group: each color
  represents an enriched term. (F) KEGG pathway terms—the interactome network generated
  (p < 0.005, FDR Q < 0.05) of hub proteins from the COVID-19(+) group: each node
  represents an enriched pathway term. The nodes are connected by a line whose thickness
  reflects the percentage of overlapping proteins, and the size of the node corresponds
  to the number of proteins. Abbreviations: PPI, protein–protein interaction; MCC,
  maximal clique centrality.'
