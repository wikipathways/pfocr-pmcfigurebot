figure_title: Melatonin suppressed TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling pathway activation
  in BMSCs.
caption: 'Melatonin suppressed TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling pathway activation in
  BMSCs. (a) Western blotting was used to investigate NF-κB pathway-related proteins
  such as p65 and p-p65. (b) Quantitative analysis of the protein levels of p-p65/p65.
  (c) Western blotting was used to investigate NF-κB pathway-related proteins such
  as IkBα and p-IkBα. (d) Quantitative analysis of the protein levels of p-IkBα/IkBα.
  Melatonin: 100 μM; TNF-α: 10 ng/mL. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD from
  three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05 versus the control (Con) group'
