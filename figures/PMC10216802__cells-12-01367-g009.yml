caption: Neurodegenerative microglia (MGnD) from aged (9 mo) APP/PS1 Alzheimer’s disease
  mice upregulate key inflammatory and RhoA signaling genes. Data from [41]. (A) WT
  microglia (from C57BL/J6 mice), Clec7a− microglia (from APP/PS1 mice), and Clec7a+
  neurodegenerative microglia (MGnD) (from APP/PS1 mice) differ in morphology. MGnD
  is associated with neuritic amyloid-β plaques, while Clec7a− microglia from the
  same mice do not. (B–E) Expression of fundamental genes involved in the RhoA signaling
  pathway (RHOA, ROCK1, ROCK2, CFL1) and (F,G) pro-inflammatory regulators (CCL3 and
  CCL4) are shown from the aforementioned microglia subtypes (n = 6/group). One-way
  ANOVAs were used with Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Error bars represent mean
  ± SEM (ns = not significant, * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, and **** = p < 0.0001)
