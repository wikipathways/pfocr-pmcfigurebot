caption: Schematically representing the signal transduction and biological activities
  induced by androgen in ER-negative breast cancer cells. Activation of iAR by DHT
  stimulates ERK1/2-mediated cell proliferation either directly or through cross-talk
  with EGFRs. Additionally, DHT binding to integrin αvβ3 activates the FAK/ERK1/2
  signaling pathway, resulting in phosphorylated ERK1/2 translocation to the nucleus
  and subsequent cell proliferation. The association of iAR, PI3K, and Src induced
  by R1881 leads to cell motility through the FAK/Akt/paxillin signaling pathway.
  The function of mAR activated by TAC is similar to that in ER-positive breast cancer
  cells. Without AR-driven signaling, EGFR enhances cell motility and proliferation
  by triggered Rac1/PI3K/Akt/PAK1 signaling and Src/ERK1/2 signaling, respectively.
  Integrin α3β1 or β1 can direct activate PI3K/Akt signaling to regulate cell motility.
  After binding of TGF-βR with TGF-β, integrin αv phosphorylates Smad2/3 to increase
  cell motility. The red arrows indicate integrin α3β1/PI3K/Akt/BRN2 pathway; The
  blue arrows indicate EGF/EGFR/Src/ERK1/2 pathway
