caption: NCAM signaling was predicted to mediate the interaction between RGCs-Snca+
  and RGCs-Snca- at the early stage following ONC. (A-B) Incoming and outgoing signaling
  patterns between RGCs-Snca+ and RGCs-Snca- cell populations at each time points
  following ONC. The ordinate axes represent different signaling pathways. The intensity
  of the color indicates the strength of the signal, with darker shades corresponding
  to a stronger signal within the respective signaling pathway in the corresponding
  cell
