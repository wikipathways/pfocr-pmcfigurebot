caption: Schematic representing the suspected roles of and molecular pathways involving
  MeCP2 in prostate-cancer progression. The suppression of the KAI1 metastasis suppressor
  gene due to alterations in methylation patterns at the KAI1 CpG-methylation sites
  within the promoter region allows for the binding of MeCP2 and subsequent reduction
  of KAI1 in prostate cancer cells [132]. Hypermethylation of the TIMP-2 promoter
  facilitates the binding of MeCP2 to affect TIMP-2 expression at the invasive and
  metastatic stages of prostate-cancer progression [133]. Transcriptional repression
  of GADD45α by the binding of MeCP2 to four aberrantly methylated CpG sites upstream
  of the proximal promoter region results in the silencing of GADD45α. Downregulation
  of MeCP2 or administration of DNMT inhibitors to increase expression of GADD45α
  may result in increased sensitivity to docetaxel chemotherapy [134]. Inhibition
  of TRIM24 may be achieved by the binding of miR-137 to the TRIM24 3′-UTR promoter
  region. However, inhibition of miR-137 by MeCP2 reduces miR-137 expression via increased
  miR-137 promoter methylation [135]. Illustration is generated using BioRender.com
