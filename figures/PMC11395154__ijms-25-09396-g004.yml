  differentially expressed genes (DEGS) involved in eight plant hormones signal transduction
  in leaves of both N192 and JI853 seedlings at the three-leaf stage under four treatments.
  NCKL: leaves of N192 seedlings treated with 0 μM 2,4-epibrassinolide (EBR) application
  at 25 °C normal temperature (CK); NCKEL: leaves of N192 seedlings treated with 2
  μM EBR application at 25 °C normal temperature (CKE); NLTL: leaves of N192 seedlings
  treated with 0 μM EBR application at 15 °C low-temperature (LT); NLTEL: leaves of
  N192 seedlings treated with 2 μM EBR application at 15 °C normal temperature (LTE);
