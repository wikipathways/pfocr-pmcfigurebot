caption: 'gCTRP3 promotes the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells through
  the AMP-activated protein kinase/sirtuin 1/nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 signaling
  pathway. (A) ALP activity of MC3T3-E1 cells was detected using an ALP assay kit
  following treatment with gCTRP3 and a signaling pathway inhibitor. (B) Osteoblast
  differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells was determined using ALP staining following treatment
  with gCTRP3 and a signaling pathway inhibitor. (C) Calcium deposits in MC3T3-E1
  cells were determined using ARS staining following treatment with gCTRP3 and a signaling
  pathway inhibitor. (D) Expression levels of osteogenic marker genes were determined
  using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR following treatment with gCTRP3 and
  a signaling pathway inhibitor. ***P<0.001 vs. Control group; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01 and
  ###P<0.001 vs. gCTRP3 group. gCTRP3, globular C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related
  protein 3; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ARS, Alizarin red staining; RUNX2, Runt-related
  transcription factor-2; OCN, osteocalcin'
