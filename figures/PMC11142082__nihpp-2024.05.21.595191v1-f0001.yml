figure_title: Principal component analysis of normalized enzyme gene copy numbers
  across all MAGs recovered from the three diet treatments
caption: The total numbers of enzymes of each degradation pathway (proteins, cellulose,
  hemicellulose, starch, and chitin) normalized to the MAGâ€™s genome completeness were
  used to generate components. Fatty acids were included as a binary where 1 designated
  that the MAG could complete all four steps of beta oxidation, while 0 designated
  that it could not. Ellipses represent t distributions around the centroids. Ellipses
  are labeled for clarity. Individual points represent individual MAGs. The larger
  shapes in the ellipses are group centroids

  gut functions across hosts and diets with diet-related functional gene enrichments
