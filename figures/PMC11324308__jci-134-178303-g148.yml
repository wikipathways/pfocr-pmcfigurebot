caption: '(A) Western blot analysis of FGF21 in BAT from BKO and Flox mice on a 12-week
  HFD (n = 3). (B) Relative mRNA expression of Fgf21 in BAT (n = 6). (C) Relative
  mRNA expression of Fgf21 in BAT SVFs and mature adipocytes from BKO and Flox mice
  on a 12-week HFD (n = 5). (D) Western blot analysis of FGF21 in primary brown adipocytes
  of control and MSTN-knockdown groups (n = 3). (E) Western blot analysis of FGF21
  in primary brown adipocytes treated with PBS or p38 inhibitor (n = 3). (F) Western
  blot analysis of FGF21 in primary brown adipocytes from Flox or BKO mice. In the
  BKO+p38 agonist group, primary brown adipocytes were treated with 1 μM dehydrocorydaline
  (n = 3). (G) Western blot analysis of FGF21 in primary brown adipocytes treated
  with a SMAD2/3 inhibitor (n = 3). (H) Western blot analysis of FGF21 in primary
  brown adipocytes treated with PBS, rMSTN, or rMSTN plus inhibitors (n = 3). In the
  rMSTN plus inhibitors group, primary brown adipocytes were treated with SMAD2/3
  and p38 inhibitor. (I and J) Relative mRNA expression of inflammatory genes (I)
  and NF-κB signaling pathway–related genes (J) in macrophages cocultured with BAT
  from Flox and BKO mice. In the BKO+rFGF21 group, macrophages were additionally treated
  with 100 nM rFGF21 (n = 4). (K) Relative mRNA expression of inflammatory genes in
  BAT from Flox, BKO+GFP, and BKO+FGF21 mice (n = 3–4). (L) Working model. All results
  are shown as the mean ± SEM. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001, compared with the Flox
  group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001, compared with the BKO group. A 2-tailed
  Student t test was used for 2-group statistical analyses, and 1-way ANOVA followed
  by Bonferroni’s post test was used for 3-group statistical analyses'
