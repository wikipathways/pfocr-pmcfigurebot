caption: Schematic diagram of the TLR-9/NF-κB/IL-6 pathway.  NETs translocate into
  fibroblasts through TLR-9 receptor interactions and lead to an increase in nuclear
  P-NF-κB, which in turn initiates the expression and increase of IL-6 in fibroblasts.
  The secretion of IL-6 promotes the expression of α-SMA and the production of collagen
  in fibroblasts through autocrine and paracrine signaling, resulting in scar hyperplasia. TLR-9 Toll-like
  receptors 9, NETs neutrophil extracellular traps, IL interleukin, α-SMA  α-smooth
  muscle actin, PMA phorbol-12-Myristate-13-Acetate
article_title: Neutrophil extracellular traps contribute to myofibroblast differentiation
  and scar hyperplasia through the Toll-like receptor 9/nuclear factor Kappa-B/interleukin-6
  pathway.
