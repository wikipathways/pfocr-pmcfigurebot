caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis
  of upregulated DEGs in RA-infected ducks. (A) Enriched KEGG pathway terms of the
  upregulated DEGs. The rich factor of each top enriched pathway is represented by
  the x-axis. The rich factor represents the ratio of the number of DEGs to the number
  of genes present for the specific pathway term. The size and color of the dots represent
  the number of enriched genes and the significance of each pathway, respectively.
  KEGG term IDs are indicated for each term name. (B) List of genes related to each
  enriched pathway. A heatmap shows the expression level of related DEGs for each
  term. Gray indicates that the gene is not associated with the term
