caption: 'Bioinformatics analysis. (A) Volcano plots (log2-fold change) were used
  to show the upregulated and downregulated genes in patients with severe NAFLD compared
  with normal and mild patients. (B) GO enriched terms associated with the DEGs in
  patients with NAFLD. (C) KEGG enriched pathways related to DEGs in patients with
  NAFLD. (D) Relative expression of LKB1 in different groups. Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD. ***P<0.001 vs. Control; ##P<0.01 and ###P<0.001 vs. FFA group. NAFLD,
  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes; DEG, differentially expressed gene; LKB1, liver kinase B1; FFA,
  free fatty acid; sh-, short hairpin'
