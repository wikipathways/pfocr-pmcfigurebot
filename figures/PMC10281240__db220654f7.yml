caption: 'Decreased mitochondrial oxidation and increased glycolysis in PPARα−/− monocytes
  exposed to 4HNE. Monocytes were isolated from PPARα−/− mice (PKO) and WT littermates.
  The cells were exposed to 4HNE, with and without FA, for 6 h and then used for assays
  of mitochondrial oxidation and glycolysis. A–E: Maximal respiration (Resp.) rate
  and ATP production (pmol/min/1,000 cells). F–J: Glycolysis and glycolytic capacity
  (mpH/min/1,000 cells). All values are mean ± SD (n = 6). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ns, no significant difference. K: Hypothesized mechanism for cGAS-STING signaling
  activation and monocyte adhesion by PPARα downregulation in diabetes. CTGF, connective
  tissue growth factor; ICAM, intracellular adhesion molecule.'

  the cGAS-STING Pathway.
