figure_title: CXCR signaling pathway.
caption: 'CXCR signaling pathway. Activation of CXCR signaling begins with the binding
  of ligands to their receptors, triggering conformational changes that activate the
  receptors. Ligand binding induces interactions between activated CXCR and heterotrimeric
  G proteins, predominantly Gαi proteins. This interaction leads to the dissociation
  of Gαi subunits from Gβγ subunits. The activated Gαi subunits and Gβγ subunits subsequently
  initiate intracellular signaling cascades through various downstream effectors.
  The Gαi subunit inhibits AC, reducing cAMP levels and subsequently decreasing PKA
  activity. The Gβγ subunits directly bind to and stimulate PLC-β, which cleaves PIP2
  to produce IP3 and DAG. IP3 promotes the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores,
  while DAG activates PKC. Activated CXCR can also stimulate PI3K, leading to the
  synthesis of PIP3. PIP3 recruits and activates Akt, which regulates cell survival,
  proliferation, and other cellular processes. CXCR activation initiates the activation
  of MAPK cascades, including the JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK pathways, which are involved
  in cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression regulation. Additionally,
  CXCR activation triggers the activation of NF-κB, which is a transcription factor
  that regulates inflammatory and immune responses. CXCR: C-X-C motif chemokine receptor;
  AC: adenylyl cyclase; cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA: protein kinase
  A; PLC-β: phospholipase C-β; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3: inositol
  trisphosphate; DAG: diacylglycerol; Ca2+: calcium ions; PKC: protein kinase C; PI3K:
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP3: phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate;
  Akt: protein kinase B; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-B'
