  signaling pathway.
caption: Model of the involvement of MoCbp7 in the calcineurin-mediated calcium signaling
  pathway. The calcium ion flux from external and internal stores initiates calcium
  signaling. Calcineurin acts as a regulatory hub in the calcium signaling pathway.
  Both MoCbp7 and MoCrz1 are important participants in the calcineurin-mediated calcium
  signaling pathway. They may precisely regulate the calcium signaling at different
  temporal and spatial levels to maintain intracellular calcium ion homeostasis. The
  correct transmission of calcium ion signals, that is, calcium ion homeostasis, is
  crucial for fungal development and virulence in M. oryzae. Created with BioRender.com
