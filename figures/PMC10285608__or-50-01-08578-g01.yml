figure_title: Adipocytes enhance HIF-1α signaling in cocultured pancreatic cancer
  cells.
caption: Adipocytes enhance HIF-1α signaling in cocultured pancreatic cancer cells.
  (A) The top pathways from GSEA of differential expression proteins in Panc-1 cells
  cocultured with adipocytes vs. monoculture (n=3) using the GSEA Hallmark database.
  (B) Visualization of the protein-protein interaction network associated with the
  enriched functional pathways of Carbohydrate Metabolism, Tissue Morphology, and
  Cancer enriched from differentially expressed proteins in the Panc-1 cells cocultured
  with adipocytes vs. monoculture (n=3). Gene products are denoted as nodes and the
  relationships between two nodes as a line. Red and green designate up- and downregulation,
  respectively. Genes with no coloring were added from the ingenuity knowledge database.
  (C) Immunoblot analysis of proteins associated with HIF-1α signaling in Panc-1 or
  MIA PaCa2 cultured with or without adipocytes for 5 days. (D) Analysis of lactate
  secretion by Panc-1 and MIA PaCa2 cells cultured alone or with adipocytes for 5
  days (n=3). (E and F) mRNA expression of ANGPTL4, GLUT1, HK2, and LDHA in levels
  Panc-1 or MIA PaCa2 when cultured alone or cocultured with mature adipocytes. Data
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. GSEA,
