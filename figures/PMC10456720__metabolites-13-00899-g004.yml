figure_title: Pathway analysis as generated by MetaboAnalyst 5.
caption: Pathway analysis as generated by MetaboAnalyst 5.0 software package for metabolites
  significantly expressed in adolescent children. The enrichment ratio is calculated
  as the number of hits within a particular metabolic pathway divided by the expected
  number of hits. Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA). Top perturbed pathways
  are shown. (A) Metabolic pathway analysis using the list of 221 significant features
  in the discovery set, and (B) a list of 16 significant features in the validation
  set. The color depth and column length indicate the disturbance degree of the pathway
