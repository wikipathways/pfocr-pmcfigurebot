caption: Diagrammatic representation of multifaceted function of OPN in various tumors.
  OPN regulates EMT, resulting in the loss of tight junctions, thereby enhancing metastasis
  with the low expression of E-cadherin and high expressions of N-cadherin, vimentin,
  slug, snail and fibronectin. Under hypoxic conditions, OPN induces activation of
  PI3K leading to phosphorylation of Akt, thereby upregulating VEGF-dependent angiogenesis.
  OPN is responsible for metabolic function by activating HIF1α under hypoxic conditions,
  which further aids in the glycolytic process with high expression of VEGF, PDK1,
  LDHA, iNOS, GLUT1 and GLUT3. OPN further regulates CSC enrichment by activating
  a cascade of signaling pathways involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR, hedgehog, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin,
  JAK/STAT and notch signaling. The interaction between OPN, αvβ3 and CD44 results
  in the activation of PI3K/Akt, FAK/MEK/ERK, EGFR and Wnt/NFκB signaling cascades,
  thereby aiding therapeutic resistance
