figure_title: Effect of TGF-β signaling pathway on CDK14 expression in PTX-sensitive
  (SK-OV- 3 and OVCAR-3) and PTX-resistant (SK3R-PTX and OV3R-PTX) cells.
caption: Effect of TGF-β signaling pathway on CDK14 expression in PTX-sensitive (SK-OV-
  3 and OVCAR-3) and PTX-resistant (SK3R-PTX and OV3R-PTX) cells. (A, B) Detection
  of the expression of TGF-β signal transducer protein Smad2 and its phosphorylated
  Smad2 (pSmad2) in SK-OV-3, SK3R-PTX, OVCAR-3, and OV3R-PTX cells by Western blot.
  Histograms show the semi-quantification analysis of blotting bands by ImageJ. (C-E)
  Detection of MDR1, CDK14, and Smad2 proteins in PTX-resistant cells. SK3R-PTX and
  OV3R-PTX cells were treated with or without TGF-β (10 ng/ml) in the presence or
  absence of a TGF-β receptor inhibitor SB431542 (10 mM) for 48 h. The protein expression
  was detected by Western blot. Histograms show the quantification analysis of blotting
  bands. (F) The logo of the Smad2 Binding Element (SBE) motif on the promoter of
  CDK14 was predicted by the JASPAR database (https://jaspar.genereg.net/). (G) The
  binding sites of Smad2 on the promoter region - 5000 bp upstream of the CDK14 transcriptional
  start site (TSS) were predicted by the TFoTF analysis. Red arrows indicate the predicted
  Smad2 binding sites with high scores. (H) Schematic illustrations of 3 plasmid constructs.
  The P750 plasmid contains 750 bp with two Smad2 binding sites, the P423 plasmid
  contains 423 bp with one Smad2 binding site, and the P276 plasmid contains 276 bp
  without a Smad2 binding site located upstream of the CDK14 TSS on the CDK14 promoter.
  (I) Detection of luciferase activities in SK3R-PTX and OV3R- PTX cells after transfection
  with different CDK14 promoter-reporter constructs for 24 h in the absence or presence
  of TGF-β1 (0 or 20 ng/ml). After 48 h treatment of TGF-β1, the Dual Luciferase Assay
  was applied. Data were presented as mean ± SEM (n=3). *, P <0.05; **, P<0.01; ns,
  not significant
