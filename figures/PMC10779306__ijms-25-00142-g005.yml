caption: Identification of prognosis-related gene sets in PAAD. (A) LASSO coefficient
  (y-axis) of gene sets and the optimal penalization coefficient (λ) via 10-fold cross-validation
  based on partial likelihood deviance. (B) The dotted vertical lines represent the
  optimal values of λ. The top x-axis has the numbers of gene sets, whereas the lower
  x-axis revealed the log (λ). (C,D) Survival analysis for PAAD patients based on
  high or low enrichment scores. (E,F) Visualization for the results of GO (E) and
  KEGG pathway analyses (F)
