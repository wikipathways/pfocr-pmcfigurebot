  Wnt/β-catenin pathway (a major signaling pathway in the hair cycle) in mice dorsal
  skin.
caption: 'Compared relative fold changes in mRNA expression of genes within the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway (a major signaling pathway in the hair cycle) in mice dorsal skin. The mRNA
  expression levels of (A) LEF1, (B) β-catenin, (C) DKK1, (D) FGF7, and (E) FGF2 in
  HC, CTL, and MSC groups were measured and analyzed. β-catenin, FGF7, and FGF2 were
  significantly increased in the saline-treated CTL AA group compared to the HC group.
  LEF1, β-catenin, FGF7, and FGF2 were significantly decreased in the MSC-treated
  AA group compared to the saline-treated CTL AA group. (A–E). The data represent
  the means ± SEM; n = 3; results are statistically significant at # p < 0.05 and
  ## p < 0.01 compared to the HC group, and * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to
  the CTL group'
