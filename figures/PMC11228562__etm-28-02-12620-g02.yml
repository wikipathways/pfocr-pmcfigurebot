  AKI mice following YSJZD therapy.
caption: GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in cisplatin-induced AKI
  mice following YSJZD therapy. (A) DEGs in the cisplatin group compared with those
  in the NC group are shown as bar graphs with the number of related DEGs on the Y-axis.
  (B) Volcano plot of DEGs in the cisplatin group compared with the NC group; the
  X-axis is log2(fold change) and the Y-axis is -log10 (Q-value). (C) Downregulated
  DEGs in the cisplatin + YSJZD group compared to the cisplatin group, intersecting
  with upregulated DEGs in the cisplatin group compared to the NC group. (D) Bar chart
  of DEGs in the cisplatin + YSJZD group compared to the cisplatin group; number of
  corresponding DEGs in Y-axis. (E) Volcano plot of DEGs in the cisplatin + YSJZD
  group compared to those in the cisplatin group. (F) Upregulated DEGs in the cisplatin
  + YSJZD group compared to the cisplatin group, intersecting with downregulated DEGs
  in the cisplatin group compared to the NC group. (G) GO_ BP-enriched bubble charts
  of DEGs in comparison groups. (H) KEGG pathway enrichment bubble charts of DEGs
  in the comparison groups. The X-axis represents the rich ratio and the Y-axis represents
  the GO or KEGG terms. The bubble size represents the number of DEGs in a GO term
  or KEGG pathway, the color represents the Q-value; red represents a smaller Q-value
  and blue represents a larger Q-value. Red, yellow and green represent inflammatory
  response, oxidative stress and apoptotic processes or pathways, respectively. GO,
