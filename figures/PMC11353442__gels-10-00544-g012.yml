figure_title: Main signaling scheme in steroid-induced ONFH.
caption: Main signaling scheme in steroid-induced ONFH. (A) The main signaling pathway
  in bone regeneration and remodeling is the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Dickkopf-related
  protein 1 (DKK-1) has a negative regulatory role in the Wnt signaling pathway. (B.)
  Corticosteroids (CS) upregulate DKK-1 and adipogenic differentiation in bone marrow
  stem/stromal cells (BMSCs) and osteoblasts (OBs) while inhibiting the Wnt signaling
  pathway. (C) The detailed signaling pathway for Figure 12B. The long-term use of
  a high concentration of corticosteroids upregulates the expression of DKK-1 in BMSCs
  and OBs causing the downregulation of Wnt signaling. Downregulation of Wnt signaling
  causes the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs that indirectly negatively
  affects angiogenesis and leads to the upregulation of the adipogenic differentiation
  of BMSCs. ONFH, osteonecrosis of the femoral head
