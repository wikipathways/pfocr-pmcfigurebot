  (a,c)—KEGG bubble plots of volatile compounds in tomato fruits and leaves; (b)—degradation
  metabolic pathway plots of aromatic compounds in tomato fruits, red circles represent
  enriched compounds and grey circles represent non-enriched compounds; color blocks
  represent FC values between different groups. (d)—Biosynthetic pathway map of terpenoids
  and steroids in tomato leaves, red circles represent compounds enriched for and
