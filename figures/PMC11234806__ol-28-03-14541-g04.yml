figure_title: Effects of PCA on cell apoptosis.
caption: Effects of PCA on cell apoptosis. Cells were treated with different concentrations
  of PCA for 24 h. (A) Effects of PCA on cell apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry.
  (B) Expression levels of cell apoptosis-regulated proteins determined by western
  blotting. (C) Quantification of cell apoptosis-regulated proteins. (D) Expression
  levels of ERK signaling pathway proteins determined by western blotting. (E) Quantification
  of ERK signaling pathway proteins. (F) Expression levels of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  proteins determined by western blotting. (G) Quantification of PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway proteins compared with the control group. In Fig. 5B, D and F, GAPDH was
  used as the loading control. PCA, procaine; p, phosphorylated. All experiments were
  assessed using one-way or two-way ANOVA for analysis. *P<0.05, **P<0.01
