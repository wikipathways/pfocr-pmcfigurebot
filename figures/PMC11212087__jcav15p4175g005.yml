caption: Identification of ten tumor cell clusters by nonnegative matrix factorization
  (NMF). (A) Heatmap using neutrophils as a reference to show the landscape of CNVs
  derived from epithelial cells. (B) K-means clustering based on CNVs reveals similarities
  between colon epithelial cells in Cluster 3 and neutrophils. (C) UMAP visualization
  of the ten tumor cell clusters. (D) Among CRC tumor cell subtypes, C2 malignancy
  has the highest cell stemness score per cell as determined by AUCell. (E) Dot plot
  displayed the scores for eight cell states and five metabolic pathways. (F) Proportion
  of patients in different malignant cell clusters. (G) Violin plots shows differences
  in CNV scores for subpopulations of malignant cells. (H) CRC Tumor cell clusters
  associated with patient overall survival risk in TCGA-COAD/READ (left panel) and
  Meta-GEO cohorts (right panel) based on Cox regression analysis
