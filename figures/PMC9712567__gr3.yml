caption: 'CNSE and RESV suppress NO and iNOS production in BV-2 cells. BV-2 cells
  were pre-treated with CNSE or RESV for 24 h in the presence or absence of LPS 1
  μg/mL for 6 h and 24 h. (A) NO production was detected using Griess reagent kit
  and (B,C) The mRNA and protein expressions of iNOS were examined by real-time PCR
  and Western blot, respectively. Data represent the mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments. The significant difference was represented by p-value less than 0.05
  (###p < 0.001, ####p < 0.0001, vs. non-treated control, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001
  and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 vs. LPS-treated control).'
