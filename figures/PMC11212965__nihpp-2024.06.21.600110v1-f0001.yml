figure_title: Transcriptional confirmation of vitamin A deficiency In adult mouse
  lungs after 8 weeks of dietary modulation
caption: (A) General schematic of the mixed host-microbiome RNA extraction and data
  analysis protocol. (B) Metabolic pathway of Vitamin A. (C) Gene expression of Lrat
  and Aldh1a1, two Indicators of tissue vitamin A status. P-values = 0.009 and 0.036
  respectively. (D) Heatmap of vitamin A targets from literature In Vitamin A-sufficient
  VAS) and vitamin A-deficient (VAD) mouse lungs. (E) Manhattan plot of ChIP-X Enrichment
  Analysis (ChEA) gene sets. Each point Indicates one term from the ChEA 2022 gene
  set. The y-axis represents the âˆ’log(p-value) of the enrichment between the input
  gene set and the ChEA term gene set. The Input gene set used Included all downregularted
  genes in VAS lungs at 8 weeks with a p value < 0.05 (n=14). All mouse RNA sequencing
  files were annotated and processed using SingleCell Toolkit version 1.9.1 on Rstudio
  version 4,1,1. Figure B created using Blorender
