caption: Endothelial gp130–HIF1α signaling mediates proinflammatory responses and
  PAI-1 production. (A) Gene expression of HUVECs induced by LPS+sIL-6R stimulation
  assessed by RNA-seq. Upstream regulator analysis of genes upregulated in HUVECs
  under LPS+sIL-6R stimulation. All datasets were examined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (Qiagen Bioinformatics). (B) Flow cytometry analysis of gp130 expression after siRNA
  transfection. (C) Cells were treated with si-IL6ST for 48 h following combined stimulation,
  and the indicated gene expressions were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
  (D and E) Cells were pretreated with PX-478 (80 μM) for 4 h followed by LPS+sIL-6R
  stimulation for 24 h, and IL-6, IL-8, and PAI-1 expression levels were analyzed
  by qRT-PCR (D) and ELISA (E). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005. P-values were
  determined using unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t tests. Data are representative
  of three (B, D, and E) independent experimental replicates and are presented as
  means ± SD.
