caption: Knockout asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) led to decreased gluconeogenesis
  and increased glycogen content in HepG2 cells under normal culture condition. (A)
  Western blot analysis of insulin signal pathway in HepG2 and ASGR1-/- HepG2 cells.
  Representative images of the band and grey intensity of phosphorylation of protein
  kinase B (pS-473) (pAKT) with insulin stimulation were shown, the remaining two
  electrophoresis are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. (B) Glycogen content. (C) The
  relative mRNA expression level of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL). (D) The relative
  mRNA expression levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) and glucose-6-phosphatase
  catalytic subunit (G6PC). (E) Western blot of PEPCK1 and glucose6-phosphatase (G6Pase).
  Representative images of the band and the grey intensity of each band relative to
  β-actin were shown (n=3). All data are shown as the mean±standard deviation. pInsRβ,
  phosphorylation of insulin receptor β. aP<0.05, unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t-test
