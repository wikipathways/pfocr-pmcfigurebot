figure_title: Proposed molecular effects of fucoxanthin through modulation of genes
  and proteins of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in TNF-α-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and
  MDA-MB-468 cells.
caption: Proposed molecular effects of fucoxanthin through modulation of genes and
  proteins of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in TNF-α-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
  cells. The black arrow shows that fucoxanthin modulated the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  genes in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Red arrows indicate inhibition by fucoxanthin,
  and green arrows show activation by fucoxanthin. The graph was created utilizing
  Microsoft PowerPoint version 1808
