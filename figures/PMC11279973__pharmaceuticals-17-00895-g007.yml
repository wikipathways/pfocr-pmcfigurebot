figure_title: Overview of metabolic pathway enrichment analysis.
caption: Overview of metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. (A) Overview of top 25
  enriched pathways. The X-axis represents the enrichment ratio, and the Y-axis represents
  pathway names; the color represents the different p values. (B) Bubble plots of
  the enrichment analysis. The X-axis represents âˆ’log10 (p value), and the Y-axis
  represents pathway names; the size and color of the dots represent different enrichment
  ratios and p values, respectively
