caption: 'Avelumab mechanism of action. A, Chemotherapy can have potentially immunogenic
  effects, in addition to its direct cytotoxicity. B, Avelumab is an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal
  antibody that binds PD-L1 on tumor cells and prevents PD-L1 from binding PD-1 receptors
  on activated T cells. Blockade of this PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway prevents
  T-cell inactivation and restores active antitumor T-cell responses. Avelumab binding
  to PD-L1 on tumors may also activate natural killer cells to mount anticancer effects
  via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Abbreviations: APC, antigen-presenting
  cell; CD8, cluster of differentiation 8; FcγR, Fc-gamma receptor; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cell; NK, natural killer; PD-1, programmed cell death receptor 1; PD-L1,
  programmed cell death ligand 1. Copyright © 2021 Grivas et al, reprinted with permission.'
