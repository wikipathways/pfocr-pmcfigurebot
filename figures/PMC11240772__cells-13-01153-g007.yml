caption: (A) The Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulates reparative dentinogenesis, which
  is modulated by the autocrine release of Wnt by Axin2. The rapid proliferation of
  pulp cells is perceived after tooth damage, with a peak at day 3 and a return to
  baseline on day 14, with dentin bridge formation. (B) The Wnt/β-Catenin signaling
  pathway is inhibited by Baicailin. (A,B) β-Catenin Protein expression of Baicailin
  treated iDPSC at each time point (C), The expression of NLK, CaMK2, β-catenin, and
  GSK3β of baicailin treated iDPSCs by western blot whereby the * and ** represent
  the significance of the result [61]. Reproduced with permission from Mengyuan Li
