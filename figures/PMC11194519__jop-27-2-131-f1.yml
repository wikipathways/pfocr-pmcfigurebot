caption: 'Protective effects of the CBD on the apoptosis signals. (A) Fluorescence
  analysis of the LIVE/DEAD and (B) its quantification. (C) Fluorescence image analysis
  of Mitochondrial integrity and (D) its quantification analysis. (E) Flow cytometry
  analysis of apoptosis using Annexin V and (F) its quantification analysis. Images
  were captured by a fluorescence filter equipped with microscopy conditions (200-
  and 400- ×). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M (n = 4 to 6 for each group). ##p
  < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. normal group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001
  vs. H2O2 group.'
