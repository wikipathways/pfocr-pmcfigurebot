figure_title: Expression of PLAUR mRNA in pancarcinoma
caption: (A) The expression of PLAUR in different tumor types retrieved from the TCGA
  database was demonstrated. (B) The expression of PLAUR was analyzed in 541 cases
  of ccRCC and 72 normal tissues.(C) PLAUR expression in ccRCC (n = 72) and the matched
  adjacent normal tissues (n = 72) was analyzed. PLAUR expression in ccRCC was analyzed
  using the GSE53757 (D) and GSE15641 (E) datasets obtained from the GEO database.
  (F) The ROC curve for PLAUR in ccRCC was graphed. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P
  < 0.001.
