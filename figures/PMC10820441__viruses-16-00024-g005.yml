  in the adiponectin signaling pathway.
caption: ZIKV infection and AdipoRon treatment of A549 cells modify gene expression
  in the adiponectin signaling pathway. (A) Schematic representation of the PPARα–CPT1
  axis of the AdipoR1/AMPK signaling pathway. (B) The ADIPOR1 gene and the CPT1 gene,
  a gene under the control of the adiponectin/AdipoR1 pathway, are downregulated after
  48 h of ZIKV infection. (C) ZIKV controls adiponectin receptor expression. Expression
  of the CPT1, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 genes was normalized to the RNAPII housekeeping
  gene. Values represent the mean and the standard deviations of three independent
  experiments. ns = not significant, * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001; *** p < 0.0002; ****
  p < 0.0001
