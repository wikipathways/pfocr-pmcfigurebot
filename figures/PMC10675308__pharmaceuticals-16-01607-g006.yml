caption: 'Heatmap visualization of the 21 potential metabolites expressed in mouse
  spleens (a). Pathway analysis of the specific metabolites (b): a. Pyrimidine metabolism,
  b. Glutathione metabolism, c. Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis,
  d. Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. In the bubble plot, larger and darker
  bubbles represent a stronger correlation between the metabolic pathway and the differential
  metabolite'
