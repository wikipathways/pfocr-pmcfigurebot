caption: Coenzyme Q functions. (a) Mitochondrial CoQ shuttles electrons in the electron
  transport chain and is reduced by dehydrogenases in diverse metabolic pathways.
  CI, Complex I; CII, Complex II; CIII, Complex III; CIV, Complex IV; CV, Complex
  V; DHODH, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; GPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  SQR, sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase; CHDH, choline dehydrogenase; PRDH, proline
  dehydrogenase; ETF, electron transfer flavoprotein; ETFDH, electron transfer flavoprotein
  dehydrogenase. (b) CoQH2 is present in cellular membranes and lipoproteins and acts
  as a chain-terminating antioxidant to inhibit both the initiation and propagation
  steps of lipid autoxidation. CoQH2 or ascorbate regenerate vitamin E from the tocopheroxyl
  radical. (c) CoQ functions in the plasma membrane redox system (PMRS) with other
  antioxidants, such as vitamin E and ascorbate. CoQ is reduced by NAD(P)H:quinone
  oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), or NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (cyb5Red). (d) The CoQ
  reductase ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) regenerates CoQH2 at the plasma
  membrane to terminate lipid peroxidation and suppress ferroptosis. Created with
