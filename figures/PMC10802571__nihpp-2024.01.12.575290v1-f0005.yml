figure_title: Metagenomic profiling of the gut microbiome of mice placed on dietary
  folate restriction late in life
caption: (A) Beta diversity principal component analysis plots were based on Bray-Curtis
  dissimilarity indices (Knight et al., 2018), of the DNA from the fecal microbiome
  sampled and sequenced at 90 weeks of age, from 5 mice in each test group. Three
  principal components (PC1,2,3; shown at the top) accounted for ~70% of the dataset
  variance. (B) Metabolic pathway biomarker changes associated with folate limitation
  late in life, from metagenomic data of the fecal microbiome. The LEfSe computational
  pipeline was used to determine the features most likely to explain the observed
  differences. The computed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) scores (Log10-transformed)
  are on the x-axis. LDA scores incorporate effect sizes, ranking the relevance of
  the identified biomarkers and enabling their visualization (Segata et al., 2011).
