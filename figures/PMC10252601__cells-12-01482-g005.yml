figure_title: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases immune responses by modulating
  plasma membrane protein-mediated intercellular communication.
caption: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases immune responses by modulating plasma
  membrane protein-mediated intercellular communication. The gene expression changes
  of 2202 human plasma membrane protein genes (11% of all protein-coding human genes)
  from the HPA (https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/plasma+membrane,
  accessed on 15 December 2022) in the veins of CKD patients were compared to those
  of non-CKD controls. (A) A schematic diagram shows the intercellular communication
  through plasma membrane proteins and the forward, reverse, and bidirectional signaling.
  (B) CKD modulates the gene expression of 73 human plasma membrane proteins with
  18 upregulated genes and 55 downregulated genes in veins. (C) Metascape pathway
  analysis showed the top pathways of the 18 CKD-upregulated plasma membrane proteins.
  (D) A schematic diagram depicts the intercellular communication between intravenous
  and extravenous (blood and other tissues). CKD downregulated genes are listed in
  Supplementary Table S7
