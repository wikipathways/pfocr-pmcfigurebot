caption: (A) Volcano plot with the differential gene expression of 223 analyzed genes
  in non-activated macrophages pre-stimulated with itaconic acid (Li-Ita) vs. infected
  macrophages (Li). Biological threshold is indicated by black vertical lines. Statistical
  threshold (p-value = 0.05) is indicated as a purple dotted horizontal line. Blue
  and red dots represent DEGs downregulated and upregulated, respectively. Black dots
  are genes without significant statistical differences. (B) Biocarta LAIR (local
  acute inflammatory response) pathway heatmap. This gene set was upregulated in infected
  macrophages pre-stimulated with itaconic acid. NRQ values are represented as colors,
  where the range of colors (red, pink, light blue, dark blue) shows the range of
  expression values (high, moderate, low, lowest). (C) Volcano plot with the differential
  gene expression of 223 analyzed genes in non-activated and uninfected macrophages
  pre-stimulated with itaconic acid (Ita) vs. non-activated and uninfected macrophages
  (M0). Blue and red dots represent DEGs downregulated and upregulated, respectively.
  Black dots are genes without significant statistical differences. Results represent
  the average of three experiments
