caption: Mechanism of this study illustrating suppression of apoptosis and HAMLET
  targets. EGFR and its related proteins are involved in cell signaling pathways that
  control cell division and survival. EGFR-related RAF and RAS gene mutations cause
  proteins to produce higher than normal amounts in CRC. HAMLET inhibits oncogenic
  Ras and Braf activity which causes tumor death (Ho et al. , ). KRAS/BRAF mutational
  status is also implicated in mitochondrial activity of CRC cancer (Rebane-Klemm
  et al. ). The relationship between HAMLET, RAS/RAF gene mutations and mitochondrial
  phenotype suggests that HAMLET affects cells through mitochondria depending on their
  activity. HAMLET is also known to activate apoptosis-like death mechanisms via intrinsic
  pathways (Boekema et al. 2015). However, APAF-1, an apoptotic protease activating
  factor that activates apoptosis, does not change after HAMLET treatment, and an
  increase of XIAP, one of the apoptosis-inhibiting proteins, shows that HAMLET does
  not cause canonical intrinsic pathway apoptosis. Up-regulation of BIRC3 (IAP2) also
  suggests that HAMLET treatment inhibits apoptosis in the extrinsic pathway as well,
  again showing that HAMLET causes cell death in a complex, non-apoptotic way which
  cannot be directly associated with KRAS or BRAF mutation
