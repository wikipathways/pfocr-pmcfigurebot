  cells in comparison with wild-type (WT) U2OS controls.
caption: Differential gene expression profiles of NR1D1/2 double mutant (NDKO/ND)
  cells in comparison with wild-type (WT) U2OS controls. (A) Venn diagram of the differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) between WT and NDKO cells. Expression levels of 1496 and
  1033 gene transcripts, among the 15,398 significantly expressed genes, were significantly
  higher in the WT and NDKO cells, respectively, as defined by >1.5-fold changes and
  p < 0.05 between the groups (n = 4 for each genotype). (B) A heat map representation
  for the top 20 upregulated and 20 downregulated DEGs of the NDKO cells. (C,D) Gene
  enrichment analyses for the (C) upregulated and (D) downregulated DEGs of the NDKO
  cells. The top significantly enriched terms were assessed using gene sets from the
  “KEGG Pathway” (left) or “GO Biological Process” (GO_BP, right) databases. Overlapping
  p values and % overlapping for the given KEGG/GO_BP terms are presented as color-coded
  bar charts
