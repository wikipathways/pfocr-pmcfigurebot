caption: Diagrammatic representation of the main intracellular signaling pathways
  of NHE1 regulating cardiac hypertrophy. The activation of NHE1 by Gq protein-dependent
  phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent Na+ overload is likely to be a crucial promotor
  of cardiac hypertrophy induced by various stimuli such as endothelin 1 (ET-1), norepinephrine
  (NE), and angiotensin II (Ang II) acting on their respective receptors. Increases
  in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production caused by cardiac ischemia may be involved
  in the activation of the ERK1/2-p90RSK pathway and therefore interact with the phosphorylation
  of serine 703. Ca2+/CaM activates NHE1 through direct interaction. NHE1 activation
  contributes to the increases of pHi and [Na+]i. Increased [Na+]i leads to sustained
  [Ca2+]i elevation by acceleration of Ca2+ influx through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
  (NCX). Increased [Ca2+]i activates two Ca2+-dependent hypertrophic signaling molecules,
  Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin (CaN). Activated CaMKII mediates
  the phosphorylation of histone deacetylase (HDAC), relieving or derepressing myocyte
  enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), whereas CaN dephosphorylates the nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT) and interacts with the transcription factor GATA, promoting transcription
  of hypertrophic genes. On the other hand, activated CaMKII phosphorylates the phospholamban
  (PLB) to accelerate cytosolic Ca2+ uptake via the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium
  transport ATPase (SERCA), and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) to increase SR Ca2+ release,
  thus augmenting the Ca2+ handling process. The increased SR Ca2+ leak could lead
  to mitochondrial Ca2+, which opens permeability transition pore (PTP) and ultimately
  results in cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
