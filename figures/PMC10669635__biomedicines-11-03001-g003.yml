  associated biological markers.
caption: Partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition (p-EMT) and full EMT with associated
  biological markers. When appropriate signalling pathways are switched on, non-polarised,
  cobblestone-shaped epithelial cells lose their cellâ€“cell contacts and change to
  mesenchymal-type motile cells. Extracellular matrix degradation enzymes, MMPs, then
  degrade the ECM and cells migrate through the basal lamina. This event can be detected
  at a molecular level by a reduction in levels of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin,
  b-catenin, cytokeratin, etc., and higher levels of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin,
  Snail, and Twist, etc. p-EMT cells also exists in a meta-stable, intermediary state
  between the epithelial and mesenchymal poles, suggesting this as a spectrum instead
  of a switch
