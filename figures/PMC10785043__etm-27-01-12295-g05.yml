  to suppress apoptosis in H2O2-treated PC12 cells.
caption: Butorphanol inhibits ferroptosis by blocking the JNK/p38 signaling pathway
  to suppress apoptosis in H2O2-treated PC12 cells. (A) Induction of apoptosis was
  detected using the TUNEL assay (magnification, x200). (B) Expression levels of the
  apoptosis-related proteins were detected using western blotting. *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001.
  JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated
  dUTP nick end labeling; ANI, anisomycin; ERA, erastin
