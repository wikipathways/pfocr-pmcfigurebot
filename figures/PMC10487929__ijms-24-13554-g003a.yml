caption: (a) Core Analysis of the top 10 enriched canonical pathways involved in overlapping
  molecules between COVID-19 and PD. Core Analysis of the overlapping molecules associated
  with COVID-19 and PD revealed the NISP (p-value of 3.1 × 10−14) as one of the top
  enriched signaling pathways as noted in the red square. (b) Core Analysis of the
  top 10 upstream regulators involved in overlapping molecules between COVID-19 and
  PD. Core Analysis of the overlapping molecules associated with COVID-19 and PD found
  SNCA (p-value of 2.25 × 10−16) as one of the top 5 upstream regulators as shown
  in red
