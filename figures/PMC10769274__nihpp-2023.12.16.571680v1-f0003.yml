figure_title: Maternal obesity alters gene expression in fetal microglia and placental
  macrophages
caption: A. Fraction of significantly DEG in obesity-exposed fetal microglia that
  are also significantly differentially expressed in obesity-exposed placental Hofbauer
  cells. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between offspring of obese and control
  dams are shown. DEG with adjusted p-value <0.05, abs(log2FC)>0.25 are considered
  significant.B. Network plot of the top 15 Gene Ontology Biological Processes enriched
  in the DEG in fetal MgYSI_Pf4, shown in both MgYSI_Pf4 and placental HBC_Cd72. Nodes
  correspond to enriched GO categories, node size is proportional to number of genes
  and edges thickness is proportional to the number of overlapping genes between the
  two categories.C. Enriched Gene Ontology biological processes in the DEG of obesity-exposed
  microglia and Hofbauer cells. Select results shown, full results shown in SI Table
  4. Shading corresponds to manual grouping of GO categories. Gene Count gives the
  number of genes in the query set that are annotated by the relevant GO category.D.
  Up- and downregulation of DEG implicated in ATP metabolism, response to oxidative
  stress, and regulation of inflammatory response in microglia and Hofbauer cells.
  DEG fold changes in obesity-exposed microglia and HBCs for three significantly enriched
  GO biological processes relevant to microglial function.* DEG with adjusted p-value
  < 0.05.E. Select IPA Canonical Pathways enriched in obesity-exposed microglial and
  Hofbauer cell cluster DEG. Positive z-score means pathway is activated in fetal
  macrophages of obese dams, and negative z-score means pathway is suppressed.F. Up-
  and downregulation of genes in fetal macrophages of obese dams for two significantly
  activated or inhibited IPA Canonical Pathways relevant to microglial function. DEG
  fold changes depicted. * DEG with adjusted p-value < 0.05
