figure_title: Working model for ura6 mutants fluorinated prodrug resistance
caption: A) The de novo pyrimidine synthesis and salvage pathway in the WT cells.
  The production of F-UTP and F-CTP leads to cell death. B) The de novo pyrimidine
  synthesis and salvage pathway in ura6 mutant cells at 30Â°C. We propose that missense
  mutations can reduce Ura6 activity, leading to the build-up of UMP in the cells.
  A reduction in UMP kinase activity could enable these mutants to generate enough
  UTP and CTP for the cells to survive, but avoid producing enough F-UTP and F-CTP
  to lead to cell death
