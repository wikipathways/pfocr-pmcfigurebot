figure_title: Macrophage Atg16l1 deficiency promotes the activation of the cGAS/STING
  pathway.
caption: Macrophage Atg16l1 deficiency promotes the activation of the cGAS/STING pathway.
  (A) Schematic diagram showing that primary hepatocytes with or without PAOA stimulation
  isolated from Atg16l1fl/fl mice were cocultured with LPS-primed primary BMDMs from
  Atg16l1fl/fl and Atg16l1ΔMϕ mice. (B) Immunofluorescence staining for STING expression
  in Atg16l1fl/fl and Atg16l1ΔMϕ BMDMs. (C) The expression levels of proteins involved
  in cGAS/STING signaling. (D) Schematic diagram showing that LPS-primed primary BMDMs
  from Atg16l1fl/fl and Atg16l1ΔMϕ mice were cocultured with mtDNA from hepatocytes
  from HFHCD-fed WT mice. (E) Immunofluorescence staining for STING. (F) The protein
  expression levels of cGAS/STING signaling markers and (G) the mRNA expression level
  of Ifnb1 in stimulated Atg16l1fl/fl and Atg16l1ΔMϕ BMDMs treated with mtDNA+LPS.
  (H) The expression levels of STING signaling proteins, (I) proinflammatory proteins
  and (J) Ifnb1 mRNA in (mtDNA+LPS)-stimulated Atg16l1ΔMϕ BMDMs treated with the STING
  inhibitor C-176. (K) The expression levels of STING signaling-related proteins and
  (L) proinflammatory proteins in (mtDNA+LPS)-stimulated Atg16l1ΔMϕTmem173ΔMϕ BMDMs.
  ATG16L1, autophagy-related protein 16-like 1; PAOA, palmitic acid- and oleic acid;
  BMDMs, bone marrow-derived macrophages; STING, stimulator of interferon genes. The
  data are expressed as the mean±SD. *P<0.05 (unpaired t test or ANOVA)
