caption: 'The canonic polyamine biosynthetic pathway of mammals (hosts of trypanosomatids).
  The enzymes involved in polyamine biosynthesis are shown in black boxes, and the
  metabolites are in empty circles. The full polyamine metabolic pathway includes
  biosynthesis and interconversion routes that starts from the essential amino acid
  L-methionine and from the semi-essential L-arginine. Putrescine, spermidine and
  spermine are synthesized from L-ornithine and AdoMetDc after decarboxylation, the
  activity of both enzymes being closely regulated by the cells. Both enzymes have
  been addressed as druggable targets for therapeutic intervention. Note that regardless
  of trypanosomatids, there is not any connection between polyamines and glutathione
  in mammals. Abbreviations of the enzymes and transporters and their corresponding
  EC numbers are given in alphabetic order: AdoMetDC, S-adenosylmethione decarboxylase
  (EC 4.1.1.50); APAO: N 1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (EC 1.5.3.13); Arginase (EC 3.5.3.1);
  DHS, deoxyhypusine synthase (EC: 2.5.1.46); DOHH deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.99.29);
  MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.6); ODC, ornithine decarboxylase (EC
  4.1.1.17); POT1, putrescine transport 1 (EC 7.6.2.16); SpdS, spermidine synthase
  (EC 2.5.1.16); SpmS, spermine synthase (EC 2.5.1.22). Abbreviations for the metabolites
  are also given in alphabetic order: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; dcAdoMet, decarboxylated
  S-adenosylmethionine; eIF5A, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A; dh-eIF5A,
  deoxyhypusine-eIF5A; h-eIF5A, hypusine-eIF5A'
