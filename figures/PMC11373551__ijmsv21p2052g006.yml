caption: Metabolism-related pathways are significantly enriched in the pathological
  progression of both the intima and adventitia of AAA. 6A-B represent the GSEA distribution
  maps of taurine metabolism pathways enriched by differential genes in the vascular
  adventitia and intima, respectively; 6C-D display heatmaps of metabolic pathway
  changes obtained after quantifying the differential genes in the vascular adventitia
  and intima using GSVA

  abdominal aortic aneurysm progression
