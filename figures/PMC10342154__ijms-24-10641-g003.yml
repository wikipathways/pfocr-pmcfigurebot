figure_title: KEGG enrichment scatter plot of DEGs.
caption: KEGG enrichment scatter plot of DEGs. The vertical axis represents the name
  of the pathway, the horizontal axis represents the gene ratio, the size of the points
  represents the number of DEGs in this pathway, and the color of the points corresponds
  to different adjusted p-value ranges. Gene ratio refers to the ratio of the number
  of differential genes enriched in the pathway (number of sample genes) to the number
  of annotated genes (number of background genes). The larger the enrichment factor,
  the greater the degree of enrichment. Adjusted p-value (padj) is the p-value after
  multiple hypothesis testing correction. The value range of padj is [0, 1]. The closer
  to zero, the more significant the enrichment. We selected the 20 most enriched pathways
  to display in this figure, and if there are fewer than 20 enriched pathway entries,
  all are displayed. (A–F) The scatter plot of up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs
  in different comparison groups mentioned above. “↑” represents the up-regulated
  DEGs, “↓” represents the down-regulated DEGs
