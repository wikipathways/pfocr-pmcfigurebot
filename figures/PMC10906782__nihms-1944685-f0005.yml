figure_title: Sorting of RSP proteins into DCV by retention and constitutive-like
  secretion.
caption: 'Sorting of RSP proteins into DCV by retention and constitutive-like secretion.
  RSP proteins can be packaged into DCVs by a “sorting-by-retention” mechanism: C-terminal
  disulfide bond is necessary for proTRH to remain in RSP vesicles (A); Non-RSP proteins
  in immature DCVs are removed by constitutive-like secretory pathways. AP-1 binds
  to the cytoplasmic tails of furin and M6PR and removes furin and M6PR from immature
  DCV via clathrin-mediated constitutive-like secretion (B). Golgi-localized, γ-ear
  containing ADP-ribosylation factor binding (GGA) mediates the removal of VAMP4 from
  immature DCVs (B); APS1 increases the activity of H-ATPase on DCVs to facilitate
  vesicle acidification. Rbcn3 promotes the translocation of CAPS1 to DCVs from the
  cytoplasm (C). proTRH: prothyrotropin-releasing hormone; M6PR: mannose-6-phosphate
  receptor; Rbcn3: rabconnectin 3; DCV: dense core vesicles; RSP: regulated secretory
  pathway'
