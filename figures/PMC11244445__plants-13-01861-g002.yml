figure_title: Untargeted metabolomics analysis of bell pepper stems exposed to both
  UV-B and cold stress.
caption: 'Untargeted metabolomics analysis of bell pepper stems exposed to both UV-B
  and cold stress. The principal component analysis was conducted on the control (gray)
  and UV-B+cold (black) biological replicates (A). The pathway analysis module of
  MetaboAnalyst identified metabolic pathways in response to UV-B+cold (B). Each circle
  represents a metabolic pathway: the circle’s color indicates its p-value; the circle’s
  size represents the pathway impact'
