caption: TNF signaling pathway features highly in the complex crosstalk network in
  the ccRCC tumor microenvironment. (A) UMAP plot of macro_mono cell subtypes. (B)
  Pseudo temporal map of macro_mono subtypes. (C) iTALK network showing that macro_mono
  cells were the most active in cytokine communication. (D) Network plot of the TNF
  signaling pathway network in ccRCC. (E) Circle plot of significant L-R pairs among
  all cell types in ccRCC. (F) Riverplot of key pathways in the incoming communication
  patterns of target cell groups. (G) Riverplot of key pathways in the outgoing communication
  patterns of secreting cell groups. (H) Network plot showing the main crosstalk of
  L-R pairs associated with the TNF signaling pathway in ccRCC. ccRCC, clear cell
  renal cell carcinoma; UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection; macro_mono,
  macrophage/monocyte; L-R, ligand-receptor; mDCs, myeloid dendritic cells; TNFRSF1A/B,
  TNF receptor superfamily member 1A/B
