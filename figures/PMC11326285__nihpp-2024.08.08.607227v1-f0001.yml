figure_title: The synthetic reductive formate pathway
caption: (A) Synthetic metabolic pathway to convert formate into acetyl-CoA, composed
  of five core new-to-nature reactions. (B) Each enzyme addition is labeled on the
  set of traces, starting with a no enzyme control. Extracted ion counts were determined
  for an m/z [M+H]+ of 797.1 for formyl-CoA, 828.1 for glycolyl-CoA, and 812.1 for
  acetyl-CoA, which corresponds to the mass of the CoA-thioester with the incorporation
  of 1 (formyl-CoA) or 2 (glycolyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA) 13C from 13C -formate. Traces
  are representative of n = 3 independent reactions
