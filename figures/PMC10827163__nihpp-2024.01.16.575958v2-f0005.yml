figure_title: A physical and functional Pcdhg-Notch axis regulates hemodynamic Klf2/4
caption: '(a) Schematic of bulk RNAseq analysis of Control si, Pcdhg si and Pcdhg+Klf2/4
  triple si HUVECs to identify Pcdhg-dependent, Klf2/4 independent DEGs (green shaded
  area). (b) Immunoblot validation of Pcdhg and Klf4 depletion. (c) Upstream regulatory
  pathway/process analysis from the DEGs using Enrichr. (d) Heat map of upregulated
  Notch target genes in Pcdhg si and Pcdhg si+Klf2/4 si compared to Control si from
  the RNAseq analysis. (e) Control si or Pcdhg si HUVECs were exposed to St or LSS
  for 2h and immunoblotted for the cleaved Notch1 Intracellular Domain (NICD Val1744)
  (N=3). Graph: quantitation of NICD Val1744 normalized to GAPDH loading control.
  (f) The NICD-dependent transcription was blocked with RIN1, a pharmacological inhibitor
  of Notch-RBPJ interaction (RBPJi) or RBPJ siRNA (RBPJ si). HUVECs were exposed to
  LSS for 16h and immunoblotted for Klf2 and Klf4 (N=3). Graph: quantitation of Klf2
  and Klf4 normalized to GAPDH loading control. (g) Schematic showing Notch1. ECD:
  Extracellular domain; TM: Transmembrane domain; ICD: Intracellular Domain. The asterisks
  (*) show the NICD peptides identified in the Mass Spectrometry analysis of the Ips
  of full but not the ΔCCD Pcdhg mutant. (h, i) Co-IP of Pcdhg and NICD Val1744. Inputs
  used as loading controls for IPs. (h) HUVECs expressing full or ΔCCD Pcdhg (C-term
  GFP-tagged) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with GFP nanobody beads and immunoblotted
  for NICD Val1744 (N=3). Vector alone used as negative control for the IP. (i) HUVECs
  expressing CCD or ΔNLS-CCD mutant (C-term FLAG-tagged) were immunoprecipitated (IP)
  with FLAG antibody beads and immunoblotted for NICD Val1744 (N=3). Statistical analysis
  was carried out using Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001'
