caption: Schematic illustration of EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Receptor
  dimerization induces the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues at the c-terminal
  cytoplasmic domain of EGFR. PI3K binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on EGFR
  and converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-disphosphate (PIP2) in the plasma membrane
  into phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), leading to the recruitment
  and subsequent phosphorylation of AKT by PDK1 and mTORC2. Phosphorylated AKT, in
  turn, leads to the activation of mTORC1 by regulating the activity of RHEB. Active
  mTOR induces the phosphorylation and activation of S6K1 and 4EBP1
