caption: Effect of FM on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in liver cancer cells.
  (A) Expression of proteins associated with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  HCC-LM3 cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml FM for 24 h. Then, cells were lysed for
  western blotting. Protein concentrations relative to GAPDH were calculated by Image
  J. (B) Expression of proteins associated with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  Hepa1-6 cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml FM for 24 h. Then, cells were lysed for
  western blotting. Protein concentrations relative to GAPDH were calculated by Image
  J. (C) DVL-2 immunostaining of HCC cells. The change in extracellular DVL-2 expression
  following FM treatment was revealed by immunofluorescence. Scale bar, 20 µm. (D)
  Quantification of DVL-2 immunostaining in human and murine cancer cells. (E) β-catenin
  immunostaining of HCC cells. The change in intracellular β-catenin expression following
  FM treatment was revealed by immunofluorescence. Scale bar, 20 µm. (F) Quantification
  of β-catenin immunostaining in human and murine cancer cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01,
  ***P<0.001 vs. control group. FM, frankincense and myrrh; con, control; DVL-2, Dishevelled
  Segment Polarity Protein 2
