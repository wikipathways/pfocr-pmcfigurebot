  transcriptional targets.
caption: miR-30a and miR-34c regulated the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and its transcriptional
  targets. (a,b) miR-30a and miR-34c relative expression in CC-derived cell lines;
  (c,d) JAK1 and STAT3 relative expression in CC-derived cell lines; (e) binding site
  of miR-30a on 3′UTR JAK1 and (f) miR-34c on 3′UTR STAT3 predicted through bioinformatics
  (The red letters represent the 3’UTR wild type region of the mRNA, the orange letters
  the mutated region and the blue letters the seed region of the miRNA); (g) luciferase
  activity of miR-30a/JAK1/JAK1mut interaction and (h) miR-34c/STAT3/STAT3mut in HeLa
  cells; (i) effects of miR-30a and miR-34c on Jak/STAT expression targets CXCL10
  and CCND1. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
