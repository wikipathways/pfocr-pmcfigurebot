caption: 'CNSE and RESV inhibit NF-κB activation in BV-2 cells. (A) BV-2 cells were
  incubated with CNSE at 25 μg/mL for 24 h, followed by LPS 1 μg/mL for 1 h to observe
  the nuclear translocation of p65 using immunofluorescence. The red color from Alexa
  Flour 555 staining represents p65 in the cells and the blue color from DAPI staining
  represents the nucleus. (B) The level of p-IκB-α and IκB-α was measured by performing
  Western blot analysis. The relative expression of p-IκB-α and IκB-α was normalized
  with β-actin. (C) NF-κB (p65) binding activity was examined by dual-luciferase assay
  and the relative expression of p65 binding activity was normalized through the activity
  of pRL-null. Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 6). The significant difference was
  represented by p-value less than 0.05 (##p < 0.01, ####p < 0.0001 vs. non-treated
  control, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001 vs. LPS-treated control).'
