caption: A proposed mechanism of BdGF14g involved in regulating ABA-signaling-mediated
  drought tolerance. BdGF14g interacts with NtABF2, the transcription and activation
  of which can be enhanced by drought-induced ABA accumulation mediated by ABA-signaling
  genes, including an ABA-synthesis-related gene, NtNECD1, resulting in increased
  ABA production, which, in turn, regulates the ABA signaling pathway via a feedback
  mechanism. BdGF14g interacts with NtABF2 and is involved in upregulating ABA-related
  genes to enhance drought resistance
