caption: Effects of miR-1 gain- and loss-of-function experiments on RA pathway during
  posterior differentiation of cardiac tube. RT-qPCR of RNA from the dissected cardiac
  asa of embryos microinjected either with CFDA, premiR-1 or antimiR-1. Note that
  nonsignificant expression of Rarα (A), Rxrα (B), Rarγ (C) and Rxrγ (D) were observed
  after miR-1 overexpression or miR-1 inhibitor treatment as compared to the control
  (CFDA). Standard deviations are from three independent experiments
