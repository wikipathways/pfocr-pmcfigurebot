figure_title: Overlapping differentially expressed genes in all hematological neoplasms
  affect cell processes.
caption: 'Overlapping differentially expressed genes in all hematological neoplasms
  affect cell processes. (A) Left side: Graphical overview of representative overlapping
  differentially expressed genes that were found in MSCs from all hematological neoplasms
  from overlapping genes in the respective group from green highlighted in Figure
  5D. A total of 74 differentially overlapping genes were identified in all hematological
  neoplasms. Right side: Transcript per million (TPM) values of TGFB1 in MSCs from
  our RNA sequencing data. Asterisks display adjusted p-values *** p < 0.001, ****
  p < 0.0001. (B) A total of 14 of these 74 genes are directly linked and form a potential
  theoretical protein network to TGFB signaling as visualized by using the STRING
  database (B, right side). A protein network was generated with the STRING database
  (Version 12.0) and adapted. Blue-circled genes indicate downregulation and red-circled
  genes indicate upregulation of these genes in our RNA sequencing. Visualization
  of further genes from the “overlap all neoplasms” group, that are regulators or
  related to the WNT and BMP/TGFB signaling pathways as well as downstream targets
  of these signaling pathways such as PITX2, HAND2, or TBX15, that were found in all
  hematological neoplasms, were contrasted with healthy MSCs. These genes play crucial
  roles in ECM, differentiation, or hematopoiesis (TGFB1*, was significant in p-value
  0.005, FDR q-value 0.1, B-ALL sample 2 exhibited a lower Transcript per million
  (TPM) expression of TGFB1 than all other samples). (C) Strong enrichment in genes
  related to osteogenesis or hematopoiesis in all MSC groups reflected by gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA). Normalized enrichment score (NES), p-value, and false
  discovery rate (FDR) are given'
