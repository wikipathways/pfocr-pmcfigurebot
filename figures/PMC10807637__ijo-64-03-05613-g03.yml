caption: Combination of Chid and Enz promotes expression of IRS4 to block KRAS signalling
  activation and to inhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR. (A) Functional enrichment analysis of RNA-sequencing
  data revealed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway was significantly enriched
  in CAL-51 cells treated with Enz and Chid. (B) Western blotting determined the inhibition
  of mTOR and p70S6k when cells were treated with Enz and Chid combination treatment.
  (C) GSEA revealed several tumour suppressor pathways were enriched only upon combination
  treatment of Enz and Chid, and (D) regulation of genes downstream of KRAS may have
  an important role. The upregulation of IRS4 was determined by (E) reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR and (F) western blotting. (G) IRS4 was upregulated under the inhibition of KRAS
  with time and increasing concentration of KRAS inhibitor. **P<0.01, ***P<0.005 and
  ****P<0.001. Chid, chidamide; Con, control; Comb, combination; Enz, enzalutamide;
