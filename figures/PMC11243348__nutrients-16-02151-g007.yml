figure_title: The effect of different concentrations of AOP30 (200, 400, and 800 μg/mL

caption: The effect of different concentrations of AOP30 (200, 400, and 800 μg/mL
  co-incubated with 1 μg/mL of LPS for 24 h on TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in Caco-2
  cells. Western blotting analysis is conducted on the expression level of TLR4 (A,B),
  and phospho-NF-κB p65 (A,C). GAPDH is used as an internal reference, data are presented
  as mean ± SD, and bars with differing superscript letters indicate significant differences
  among the groups (p < 0.05)

  Hance to Alleviate Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction
  and Inflammation via the TLR4/NfκB Signaling Pathway in Caco-2 Cell Monolayers
