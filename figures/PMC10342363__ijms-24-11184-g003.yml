caption: 'Some examples of the organization of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for
  the production of secondary metabolites (SMs) in fungi. (a) BGCs for production
  of SMs based on so-called “central” gene, which encodes one type of megasynthase
  or another: (i) NRPS (nonribosomal peptide synthetase), (ii) PKS (polyketide synthase),
  or (iii) NRPS-PKS hybrid. (b) “Early” and “late” BGCs for production of cephalosporin
  C in Acremonium chrysogenum [168]. (c) BGCs for production of lovastatin in Aspergillus
  terreus: P450—cytochrome P450 [169]. (d) BGCs for production of terpenoid SM: TPC—terpene
  cyclase. (e) BGCs for production of meroterpenoid with unique structure. BGC for
  production of biscognienyne B is given as an example [125]. (f) BGC for production
  of kojic acid in Aspergillus oryzae [133]. Gene loci for enzymes of the biosynthetic
  pathways of the SMs are colored in red; gene loci for protein transporters of biosynthetic
  products are colored in blue; gene locus for protecting the microorganism from the
  produced secondary metabolite is colored in green; gene locus for the specific regulator
  of this biosynthetic pathway is colored in white; locus for gene with unknown function
  is colored in brown. Genes for backbone enzymes (NRPS, PKS, and TPC) responsible
  for the production of the core structure of SMs are colored in red'
