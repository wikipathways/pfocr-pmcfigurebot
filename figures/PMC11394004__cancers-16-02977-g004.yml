caption: 'Heatmaps depicting the relative expression levels of proteins belonging
  to “Integrin signaling pathway”. (A) Heatmap shows the relative expression levels
  of proteins belonging to “Integrin signaling pathway” (P00034) detected in exosomes
  derived from OMM 2.5 and Mel 270. Here is shown the comparison of three technical
  replicates. (B) Representative immunoblots of ITGα5, ITGαV, ITGα4, and ITGα6 integrins
  in EVs from OMM 2.5 and Mel 270. Equal amounts (30 µg) of exosome proteins were
  probed with the indicated antibodies against integrins. Two experimental replicates
  of EVs were loaded, and the Flotilin-1 signal was used as a loading control. Panel
  (C) shows the quantifications of signals detected in their respective immunoblots.
  p-values were calculated by two-sided t-test * p < 0.05; ns non-significant. (D)
  Representative images of integrins αvβ5 (green) and αvβ3 (green) immunostaining
  in OMM 2.5 cells seeded on vitronectin, fibronectin, or gelatin. Slides were counterstained
  with phalloidin (red) and DAPI (blue). Scale bar: 50 µm. One representative of three
  independent experiments is shown. The original Western blot figures can be found
  in Supplementary File S1'
