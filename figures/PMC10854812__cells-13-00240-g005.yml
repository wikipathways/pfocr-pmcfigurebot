caption: Function of CD133 protein. Phosphorylation of Tyr828 and Tyr852 residues
  of CD133 by non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK) Fyn triggers the activation of PI3K-
  and NRAS-dependent pathways in melanoma. Upon the phosphorylation of both Tyr828
  and Tyr852 residues, located on the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of CD133, the
  phosphorylated Tyr828 (pTyr828) and Tyr852 (pTyr852) recruit the regulatory subunit
  of PI3K, p85, and the adaptor protein Grb2 to mediate the activation of PI3K/PDK-1/AKT
  and PI3K/AKT/MDM, and NRAS/RAFMEK pathways, respectively. The activated PI3K/PDK-1/AKT
  pathway induces the inhibition of p27 and the activated PI3K/AKT/MDM2 pathway induces
  the ubiquitination of p53. Meanwhile, the activated RAS/RAFMEK pathway induces the
  activation of ERK. Consequently, the activation of Fyn-stimulated signaling to downstream
  pathways of both PI3K and Grb2 results in melanoma growth and resistance
