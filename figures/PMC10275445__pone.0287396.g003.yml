caption: '(A) The top 20 significant enriched pathways based on the first objective:
  The haplotype effect (for both 2 days and 7 days’ infection); (B) The top 20 significant
  enriched pathways based on the second objective: The temporal profile (from 2 days
  to 7 days). Y-axis label represents pathway and X-axis label represents enrichment
  factor.'
