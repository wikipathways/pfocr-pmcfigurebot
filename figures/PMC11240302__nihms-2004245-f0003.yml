caption: 'A. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of H460 cells pre-treated with DMSO or
  25 nM IACS-010759. OA: oligomycin A; CCCP: Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone.
  Data represent one of three independent experiments.B. NAD+:NADH ratio in H460 cells
  treated with DMSO or 25 nM IACS-010759 for 24 hours (n=3).C. Volcano plot showing
  metabolomic changes in H460 cells treated with DMSO or 25 nM IACS-010759 for 24
  hours. The pink circles are increased purine metabolites with FDR < 0.05.D. Schematic
  illustrating the mechanism of NDI1 rescue of ETC complex I blockade.E. OCR of control
  and NDI1-expressing H460 cells pre-treated with DMSO or 25 nM IACS-010759. Data
  represent one of three independent experiments.F. NAD+:NADH ratio in control and
  NDI1-expressing H460 cells treated with DMSO or 25 nM IACS-010759 for 24 hours (n=3).G.
  Growth rates of control and NDI1-expressing cells cultured in glucose or galactose
  medium and treated with DMSO or 25 nM IACS-010759 (n=6). Data are from one of three
  independent experiments.H. Principal component analysis of metabolomic profiles
  in control and NDI1-expressing H460 cells treated with DMSO or 25 nM IACS-010759
  for 24 hours.I. Relative abundance of the indicated purine nucleotides in control
  and NDI1-expressing H460 cells treated with DMSO or 25 nM IACS-010759 for 24 hours
  (n=3).J. Metabolite set enrichment analysis comparing IACS-010759-treated control
  and NDI-expressing H460 cells.K. Western blot validating deletion of UQCRC2. Vinculin
  is the loading control.L. OCR in WT and UQCRC2−/− H460 cells. AA; antimycin A. Data
  are from one of three independent experiments.M. Metabolic pathway analysis of differentially
  abundant metabolites in UQCRC2-depleted (UQCRC2−/−) H460 cells compared to parental
  cells.N. Relative abundance of the indicated purine metabolites in WT and UQCRC2−/−
  H460 cells (n=3).Unpaired, two-sided t tests were used for the statistical analyses.
