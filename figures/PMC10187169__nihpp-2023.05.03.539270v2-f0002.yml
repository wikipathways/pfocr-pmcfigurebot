figure_title: Pathways included in the model.
caption: Pathways included in the model. (A) VEGF interacting with VEGFR1, VEGFR2,
  and NRP1. Inhibition of VEGFR2 by Hes1 and upregulation of VEGFR1. (B) Pathway leading
  to the downstream phosphorylation of Akt on ser473 and thr308 and activation of
  mTORC1. (C) Notch signaling pathway influenced by hypoxia. Green and blue colors
  represent different cells. (D) HIF signaling pathway leads to the production of
  VEGFA. Solid green lines indicate normoxia-induced events. Red dashed lines indicate
  hypoxia-induced events. (E) Calcium cycling module including current through the
  CRAC channels and PM pump, endoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling through SERCA and
  IP3R, and indirect stimulus of IP3 by VEGF. Na+-Ca2+ exchanger increases intracellular
  calcium concentration under hypoxia. (F) MAPK-ERK signaling pathway interacting
  with the calcium cycling module
