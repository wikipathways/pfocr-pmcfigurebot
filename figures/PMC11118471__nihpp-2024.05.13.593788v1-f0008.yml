figure_title: Singlet oxygen and pub4 alter the expression of Salicylic acid-related
  genes and Salicylic acid content
caption: The effect of singlet oxygen (1O2) on Salicylic acid (SA) content and signaling
  was assessed. (a) An overview of SA synthesis via the isochorismate synthesis (ICS)
  (left side) and the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathway (right side). (b)
  Relative expression (compared to wt in the same light condition) of ten key SA biosynthesis
  genes from panel a. Genes involved in the ICS and PAL pathways are labeled in yellow
  and blue, respectively. Expression data is from the DESeq2 analysis of the included
  RNA-seq data set. Error bars in the graph represent standard error (ifcSE) estimated
  by DESeq2 (*, padj < 0.01). (c) Heatmap showing relative expression of genes associated
  with the regulation of SA biosynthesis from the RNA-seq data set (“wt. vs. fc2”
  or “wt vs. fc2 pub4” in constant 24h light conditions or after two days of 16h light/8h
  dark diurnal (cycling) light conditions). The blue and red colors correspond to
  low and high gene expression, respectively. (d) SA content (ng/g fresh weight (FW))
  measured in 17-day-old plants (grown in 24h light conditions or after two days of
  cycling light conditions). Shown are mean values ± SEM (n = 3 replicates). Statistical
  analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison
  test. Different letters above the bars indicate significant differences (P value
  ≤ 0.05). Closed circles represent individual data points
