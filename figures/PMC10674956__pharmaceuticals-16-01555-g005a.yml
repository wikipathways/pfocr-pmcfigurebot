caption: 'Metabolite-related analyses: (A) pathway analysis (result 1 with relative-betweenness
  centrality and result 2 via out-degree centrality); (B) joint pathway analysis (result
  1 with degree centrality, result 2 via betweenness centrality, and result 3 via
  closeness centrality) with different criteria. Metabolic pathways that are repeatedly
  observed in various topological analyses are inherently more indispensable'
