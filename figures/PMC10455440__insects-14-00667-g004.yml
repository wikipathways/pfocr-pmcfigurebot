caption: Gene expression profiles of genes involved in (A) Jak/STAT immune signaling
  pathway, (B) stress response/detoxification, and (C) antimicrobial effectors in
  T. ni infected with either B. bassiana or C. javanica, evaluated at 2 days post-infection
  (sample size = 13 larvae/treatment). Each dot represents a single larva with horizontal
  lines representing mean expression with 95% confidence intervals (STATB represents
  median and interquartile range). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; **** p < 0.0001; ns =
  not significant
