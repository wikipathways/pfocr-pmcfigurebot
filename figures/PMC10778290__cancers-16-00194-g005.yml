caption: 'ESM1 promotes angiogenesis through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. (A–D)
  RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on HUVECs treated with the CM obtained from
  GC cells in the presence or absence of a neutralizing antibody against ESM1. (A)
  Heatmap of significantly differential genes. (B,C) The gene set enrichment analysis
  of gene ontology performed using the cluster Profiler R package based on differential
  genes. (B). Bubble chart of the top 20 enriched GO biological processes processed
  using ggplot2 R package. (C) Enrichment map of specific GO sets of interest. (D)
  GO enrichment network analysis performed with cluego, a Cytoscape plug-in based
  on significantly differential genes. (E) The protein expression of HUVECs treated
  with the CM obtained from AGS-shESM1 cells in the presence or absence of recombinant
  ESM1 or c-Met-inhibitor; AGS cells in the presence or absence of a neutralizing
  antibody against ESM1 or the c-Met-inhibitor detected using Western blot with indicated
  antibodies. The uncropped blots are shown in Supplementary Materials Figure S5E.
  (F) The protein expression in HUVEC-shNC and HUVEC-shc-Met cells treated with recombinant
  ESM1 at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 min detected using a Western blot with indicated
  antibodies. The uncropped blots are shown in Supplementary Materials Figure S5E.
  (G) The Tube formation of HUVECs treated with the CM obtained from AGS-shESM1 cells
  in the presence or absence of recombinant ESM1, MAPK/ERK inhibitor or c-Met-inhibitor,
  AGS cells in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibody against ESM1, MAPK/ERK
  stimulator, or MAPK/ERK-inhibitor Scale bar: 200 µm. (H) The results of the CAM
  assay performed using embryonated chicken eggs treated with the CM obtained from
  AGS-shESM1 cells in the presence or absence of recombinant ESM1, MAPK/ERK inhibitor,
  or c-Met-inhibitor, AGS cells in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibody
  against ESM1, MAPK/ERK stimulator or MAPK/ERK-inhibitor. The inner diameter of the
  sampling rings was 8 mm'
