  via the Wnt signaling pathway.
caption: (A) AFSCs promote intestinal organoid ISC and epithelial cell proliferation
  via the Wnt signaling pathway. The study included intestinal organoids with AFSCs
  treated with two known Porcn inhibitors (Wnt-c59 and IWP2, which are involved in
  Wnt maturation and release). (B) The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role
  in reducing intestinal injury in NEC. Ileum sections from NEC mice treated with
  C59 and IWP2-treated AFSCs showed increased villus damage compared with NEC + AFSCs.
  (C) wnt-AFSC treatment promotes epithelial cell proliferation (Ki67) [137]
