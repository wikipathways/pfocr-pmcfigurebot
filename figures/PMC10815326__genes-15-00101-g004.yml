caption: Gene set enrichment analysis of the Reactome Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4)
  pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis of the TLR4 signaling pathway shows no significant
  difference between tissues in Npc1−/− mice (A) or in wild-type controls (C). Notably,
  while TLR4 pathway gene set enrichment is significantly higher in the cerebellum
  of Npc1−/− mice compared to the cerebral cortex (B), no differences were found between
  tissues in the wildtype brain (D). ES = enrichment score; NES = normalized enrichment
  score; FDR-q = false discovery rate q value
