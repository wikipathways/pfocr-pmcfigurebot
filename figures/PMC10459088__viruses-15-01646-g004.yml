caption: Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing screened demethylated genes. (A)
  Classification of differentially methylated genes. (B) Scatter plots showing the
  orientation of the differentially methylated sites. The red plots indicate the hypermethylation
  genes and the green plots indicate the hypomethylation genes. (C) GO and KEGG pathways
  enrichment analysis of demethylated genes associated with viruses. GO, Gene Ontology;
  KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. (D) A549 cells were treated with
  5-aza-CdR at concentrations of 0 and 5 μM for 72 h to detect mRNA expression levels
  of the screened genes. (E) A549 cells were infected with CA07 (MOI = 5) for 48 h
  to detect mRNA expression levels of the screened genes. (F) A549 cells were treated
  with poly (I:C) for 12 h to detect mRNA expression levels of the screened genes.
  (G) Western blot results of OASL and DNMT1 in A549 cells after treatment with 5-aza-CdR
  at 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 μM for 72 h. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Significance
  was calculated using one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison tests. ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001
