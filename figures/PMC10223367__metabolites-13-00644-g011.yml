caption: 'Pathway analysis of the urine of ΝICU late preterms’ urine with RDS versus
  control NICU late preterms metabolic data displaying metabolic pathways arranged
  by scores from pathway enrichment analysis (y axis) and from topology analysis (x
  axis). Each point represents a metabolic pathway. The color and size of each circle
  are based on p-values and pathway impact values, respectively. 5: Phosphatidylinositol
  signaling system; 6: Primary bile acid biosynthesis; 7: Cysteine and methionine
  metabolism; 8: Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism; 9: Ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone
  biosynthesis; 14: Butanoate metabolism; 15: Citrate cycle (TCA cycle); 16: Alanine,
  aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; 17: D-Glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism;
  18: Phenylalanine metabolism; 19: Valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis;
  20: Purine metabolism; 21: Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; 22: Glutathione
  metabolism; 23: Pentose phosphate pathway; 24: Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism;
  25: Valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation; 26: Nicotinate and nicotinamide
