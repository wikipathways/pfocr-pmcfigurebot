caption: 'α-Mangostin inhibited the TGF-β signaling pathway in Ang II-induced HK-2
  cells. (B-F) The protein levels of TGF-β1, TGF-β1R, Smad3, Smad2, and p-Smad2 in
  Ang II-induced HK-2 cells were assessed after 24 hours of treatment. GAPDH was used
  as the control. Error bars indicate the SD. **P < 0.01, *P < 0.1, compared to the
  MOD group; ##P < 0.01, #P < 0.1, compared to the CON group; n = 3 - 4. Los: Losartan;
  α-M: α-Mangostin'
