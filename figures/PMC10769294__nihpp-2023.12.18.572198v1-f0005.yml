caption: A) Phosphoglycerate mutase in glycolysis pathway; B) Normalized gene expression
  heatmap of genes involved in the glycolysis; C) Transcripts level of pgk in TRP16-UTD24
  and BPD16-UTD24; D) Transcripts level of pgm in TRP16-UTD24 and BPD16-UTD24; E)
  MDF analysis showing the cumulative driving force of glycolysis; E) Driving force
  plot showing phosphoglycerate mutase (pgm) and phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) are
  two top most driving force reactions; F) Individual driving force of each reactions;
  G) Enzyme cost of glycolysis for TRP16 showing phosphoglycerate mutase has the lowest
  enzyme costs; H) Carbon usage efficiency for UTD24, TRP16, TRP24, BPD16, and BPD24.
