figure_title: Transcriptome analysis of the Gmssp mutant and the WT.
caption: Transcriptome analysis of the Gmssp mutant and the WT. (A,B) Venn diagrams
  showing the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Gmssp or t7
  and their respective WTs that are shared among different tissues; the total number
  of DEGs is indicated under the tissue name. (A) Stem, pulvinus, petiole, and leaf
  at the V4 stage. (B) Apical meristem, leaf at the V4 stage, leaf at the V8 stage,
  and leaf of t7 at the V4 stage. (C) Gene Ontology (GO) term and pathway enrichment
  analysis among the DEGs between the WT and Gmssp in petiole tissue at the V4 stage
  using ClueGO v2.5.9. The names on the left (y axis) represent the enriched GO terms
  or pathways; the numbers at the top (x axis) represent the percentage of genes per
  term; the number of enriched genes is indicated at the end of each bar. GO terms
  or pathways of the same color next to each other belong to the same group according
  to KappaScore grouping. *, ** Significant differences at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01,
  respectively. (D) Heat map of genes involved in APC-related ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
  (APC) and plant hormone signal transduction pathways, i.e., gibberellin (GA), cytokinin
  (CK), auxin, and brassinosteroid (BR), in petioles. Sample names are indicated at
  the bottom; the related pathway abbreviation is listed before the gene name
