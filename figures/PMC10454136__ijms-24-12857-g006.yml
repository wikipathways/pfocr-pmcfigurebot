figure_title: KEGG enrichment analysis.
caption: KEGG enrichment analysis. (A) KEGG classification histogram of DEGs. The
  ordinate represents the name of the KEGG pathway, and the abscissa represents the
  number of genes annotated to the pathway. The color of the columns represents the
  q-value of the hypergeometric test. (B) KEGG distribution map of DEGs. The abscissa
  represents GeneRatio, which indicates the proportion of genes of this pathway relative
  to all DEGs. The ordinate represents each pathway. The sizes of the dots represent
  the number of DEGs annotated in the pathway, and the colors of the dots represent
  the q-values of the hypergeometric test. Upward-pointing triangles represent up-regulated
  genes, and downward-pointing triangles represent down-regulated genes
