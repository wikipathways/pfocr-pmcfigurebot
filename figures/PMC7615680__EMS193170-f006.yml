figure_title: The in vitro reconstituted COQ metabolon is regulated COQ8B
caption: a, GC/MS analysis of the overnight COQ metabolon transformation reaction
  of 1 to CoQ1(H2). The XICs and full-scan mass spectra of CoQ1 and CoQ1H2 recorded
  from the reaction mixture are shown. XIC and full-scan mass spectra of 500 ppm analytical
  standard are reported in Fig. 5d,e. RT, retention time. b, Hit map showing detected
  (green) and undetected (red) CoQ1 biosynthesis intermediates after overnight COQ
  metabolon reaction. Intermediates for which an analytical standard was not available
  are depicted in grey. Individual COQ proteins or activators were removed one at
  a time (Supplementary Fig. 9). c, Percentage of conversion of 1 in CoQ1, either
  in the reduced (green) or oxidized (orange) form, in different conditions (Supplementary
  Figs. 10 and 11). d, Hit map showing the intermediates detected after conversion
  in the presence or absence of COQ8B and ATP or ADP. e, Vertebrate CoQ biosynthetic
  pathway in light of the findings of this work. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives
  are highlighted in green, immature hydroquinones in yellow and the final product
  in orange. COQ proteins responsible of each ring decoration step are reported below
  the arrow, co-substrates, metals and ancillary proteins (green) above. Individual
  data points corresponding to n = 2 independent measurements are shown in c. The
  bars of the histogram show the mean value of independent replicates
