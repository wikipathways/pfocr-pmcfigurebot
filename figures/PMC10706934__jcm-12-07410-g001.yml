figure_title: Hypothetic signalling pathway triggered by FK506.
caption: Hypothetic signalling pathway triggered by FK506. If the cell does not receive
  TGF-β/BMP9 angiogenic signals, the TRβ-I is inhibited by FKBP12, and the pathway
  is not initiated. In the presence of TGF-β/BMP9, the pathway will be activated with
  consequent phosphorylation of SMAD and expression of the target genes. After treatment
  with the immunosuppressant FK506, the same activation of the pathway is observed,
  as it sequesters the inhibitor of the TRβ-I, FKBP12, which can phosphorylate SMAD
