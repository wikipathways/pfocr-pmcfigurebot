figure_title: Comprehensive 15N profiling and isotopologue analysis of sphingolipid
  species
caption: '(A) Overview of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. The illustrated pathway
  model, tailored for r-DMFA analysis, aligns with the model detailed by (Alsiyabi
  et al., 2021). This representation captures the full spectrum of active metabolic
  transformations in Arabidopsis sphingolipid biosynthesis. It integrates specific
  enzyme activities and streamlines metabolic pathway steps, especially where existing
  literature is limited. The model accommodates enzyme promiscuity, underscores minimal
  enzyme activity, and acknowledges the dominance of either C16 or C24 fatty acids
  (FA) in sphingolipids. We’ve also excluded certain reactions, notably those converting
  non-hydroxylated ceramides to complex forms, consistent with the primary composition
  of glycosylated sphingolipids. For clarity, blue elements relate to C16 fatty acids,
  while red pertains to C24, with accompanying enzyme annotations (letters a-h) for
  specificity. SPT: serine palmitoyltransferase, KSR: 3-ketosphinganine reductase,
  SBH: LCB C-4 hydroxylase, CSI: class I ceramide synthase, CSII: class II ceramide
  synthase, SLD: LCB Δ8 desaturase, FA2H: fatty acid hydroxylase, GCS: glucosylceramide
  synthase, GlcCer: glucosylceramide, GIPCS: glycosyl inositolphosphoceramide synthase,
  LCB: long chain base, LCBK: long chain base kinase and DPL1: dihydrosphinganine
  phosphate lyase. Letters a-h indicate the enzyme reaction specificity to the leading
  reactive species. (B) A quantitative snapshot of 15N-labeled sphingolipids in Arabidopsis
  T87 cell cultures. This captures the isotopic abundance of sphingolipids on day
  5 of the growth phase, with patterns resonating with those in Arabidopsis Col-0
  crude samples as reported by Markham & Jaworski (2007). We’ve provided distinct
  notations to differentiate between saturated, unsaturated, and hydroxylated forms
  of both dihydroxy and trihydroxy LCB groups and FA entities. For a more granular
  view of the growth trajectory, see Supplementary Fig. 1. Saturated forms of dihydroxy
  and trihydroxy LCB groups are represented by “d18:0”, “t18:0” while the unsaturated
  forms are represented as “d18:1” and “t18:1”, respectively. FA groups in saturated
  and unsaturated forms for example with 16 carbon chain, C16 are represented as “c16:0”,
  “c16:1” while the hydroxylated forms are “h16:0”, “h16:1”. (C) Transient isotopologue
  fractions [(m+1)/(m+1+m+0)] of 36 sphingolipid species during 15N labeling. Each
  depicted fraction represents the proportion of 15N enrichment in the measured analyte
  relative to its entire pool. The labeling also accounts for both pre-existing analytes
  and those integrated with 15N during the experiment. The patterns observed highlight
  the adaptability of the introduced 15N label in different sphingolipid species,
  with specific attention to their rate of incorporation over time'
