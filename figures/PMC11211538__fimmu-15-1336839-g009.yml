caption: Characterization of pathway enrichment between risk groups. (A) The t-value
  of the GSVA scores was used to rank the differences in biological functions between
  high-risk and low-risk septic patients. (B, C) The GSEA scores of signaling pathways
  revealed the upregulated and downregulated main pathways between high-risk and low-risk
  septic patients. (D) A heatmap displayed the expression profiles of 13 characteristic
  CuAS between low-risk and high-risk septic patients. Patient annotations included
  status, age, gender, and risk subtypes.
