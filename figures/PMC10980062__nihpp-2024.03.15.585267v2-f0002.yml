figure_title: Cell-type-specific pathway perturbations in AD
caption: (a—c). Heatmaps representing select Gene Ontology biological processes dysregulated
  in individual cell types (nominal P < 0.05). Each column represents data for a particular
  brain region. Unique alterations denote evidence of pathway alteration in a single
  cell type, with red indicating upregulation and blue signifying downregulation.
  Pathways discussed in the Article are highlighted in bold text. (d—f), Distribution
  of up- and down-regulated pathways across each cell type. Black indicates upregulation
  and grey indicates downregulation. (g—i), Upset plots displaying the distribution
  of uniquely perturbed pathways.
