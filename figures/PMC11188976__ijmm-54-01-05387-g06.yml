  signalling pathway.
caption: 'AH2QDS ameliorates PQ-induced acute lung injury by modulating the PI3K/AKT/eNOS
  signalling pathway. (A-C) Expression levels of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt and AKT proteins
  in different groups of lung tissues were detected by WB. (D and E) Expression levels
  of eNOS proteins in different groups of lung tissues detected by WB. (F-H) Expression
  levels of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt and AKT proteins in different groups of human pulmonary
  microvascular endothelial cells were detected by WB. Data are expressed as the mean
  Â± SEM of three independent experiments. Compared with the control group, **P<0.01
  and ***P<0.001. Compared with the PQ group, #P<0.05 and ##P<0.01. AH2QDS, anthrahydroquinone-2,6-disulfonate;
  PQ, paraquat; eNOS, eNOS, endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase; p-, phosphorylated;
  WB, western blotting; ns, not significant'
