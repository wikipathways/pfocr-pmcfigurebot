figure_title: (A) Enriched signaling pathways and overlapping genes.
caption: (A) Enriched signaling pathways and overlapping genes. The x-axis represents
  the significance of gene expression in the signaling pathways, where higher values
  indicate more significant expression of the important genes within the pathways.
  The y-axis represents the signaling pathways derived from the analysis of these
  important genes. The orange color represents the signaling pathways associated with
  panobinostat. The size of the circles corresponds to the overlap of important genes
  in the signaling pathways, with larger circles indicating a greater degree of overlap.
  (B) Chromatin organization signaling pathway and drug action site. By using Reactome,
  we found a pathway–gene network of chromatin organization signaling pathways and
  drug action sites. The upper right corner depicts the chromatin organization signaling
  pathway, while the left image illustrates the drug’s response location within this
  pathway
