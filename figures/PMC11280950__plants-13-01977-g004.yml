figure_title: Role of DNA methylation in response to drought stress in plants.
caption: Role of DNA methylation in response to drought stress in plants. Drought
  stress induces DNA methylation modifications. DNA methylation is maintained by DNA
  methyltransferases and demethylases. De novo methylation can occur through the RdDM
  pathway in plants. Additionally, alternative splicing and long noncoding RNAs play
  a role in the response to drought stress. DNA methylation may influence alternative
  splicing events in stress response and interact with long noncoding RNAs. The modifications
  in DNA methylation, alternative splicing, and long noncoding RNAs contribute to
  the reprogramming of the transcriptome, including the expression of stress-responsive
  genes. RdDM, RNA-directed DNA methylation
