figure_title: IDR ensemble dimensions explain responsiveness to changes in cell volume
caption: (A) Using rapid osmotic perturbation, cellular volume is reduced (top) or
  expanded (bottom), altering intracellular crowding within seconds. These timescales
  ensure changes in FRET efficiency (ΔEf) reflect physical changes in the cellular
  environment, as opposed to the downstream consequences of a response pathway driven
  by phosphorylation or gene expression. (B) If macromolecular crowding were the only
  determinant of IDR dimensions, we would naively expect a decrease in cell volume
  to drive ensemble compaction (top) and an increase in cell volume to drive ensemble
  expansion (bottom). (C) Actual data for sequences 5/31/18, demonstrating that while
  some sequences respond as expected by the naive model (left), others show complete
  insensitivity (middle) while others show inverse behavior, expanding upon volume
  reduction (right). These results illustrate the complex range of sequence-dependent
  responses available to IDRs. N for each violin plot is in Table S5. (D) To quantitatively
  compare different sequences, we can compare basal FRET efficiency (Ef under normal
  conditions) with the change in FRET efficiency ΔEf upon increase or decrease in
  cellular volume. (E) Sequence properties (fraction of disorder-promoting residues,
  FCR, and kappa) are weakly correlated with molecular function (see also Fig. S10),
  here defined as the change in FRET efficiency upon cell volume decrease. In correlating
  ΔEf vs. many sequence parameters, Ef basal (and, to a lesser extent, ensemble dimensions
  from coarse-grained simulations) offer the strongest predictive power of molecular
  function (Fig. S10). (F) Plotting ΔEf upon the increase in cellular volume and (G)
  ΔEf upon the decrease in cellular volume reveals that the most sensitive sequences
  (those with the largest change in Ef) are strongly correlated with those that start
  out being more expanded under basal conditions
