figure_title: JWJ-01–306 combination treatment overcomes acquired resistance to K-Ras
  inhibitors in PDAC via metabolic pathway reprogramming
caption: A. JWJ-01–306 synergizes with sotorasib to inhibit proliferation of sotorasib-resistant
  MIA PaCa-2 cells. Cells were treated with the indicated compounds and cell numbers
  were measured using trypan blue exclusion. Data is depicted as the average +/− S.D.
  of n = 3 biological replicates. B. JWJ-01–306 effectively inhibits proliferation
  of SUIT2 cells. Cells were treated with the indicated compounds and cell confluence
  was measured using a Cellcyte X live cell analyzer. Data is depicted as the average
  +/− S.D. of n = 3 biological replicates with n = 4 technical replicates each. C.
  Sotorasib-resistant MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with DMSO, 1 μM sotorasib, 10
  μM JWJ-01–306, or 1 μM sotorasib + 10 μM JWJ-01–306 (combo) for 72 hrs followed
  by global proteomics analysis, n = 3 biological replicates per condition. Protein
  abundance changes were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test (FDR < 0.05) and clustered
  using K-nearest neighbors clustering. Each line within the clusters is color-coded
  according to its distance from the cluster center, ranging from purple (close) to
  light blue (far). Proteins in each cluster were then evaluated for pathway enrichment
  using GO and KEGG pathway analysis. Representative pathways are shown and pathways
  associated with ZBTB11 function are highlighted in blue text. Full datasets in Dataset
