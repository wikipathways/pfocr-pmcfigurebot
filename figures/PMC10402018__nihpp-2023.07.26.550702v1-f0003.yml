caption: Pharmacological inhibition of the Raf1 pathway inhibits HCMV infection. (A-B)
  Regorafenib (Reg) or (C-D) Sorafenib (Sor) treated (A,C) MRC5 or (B,D) HFF fibroblasts
  were treated with indicated concentration of drugs or DMSO control at the time of
  infection. (A-D) Cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with AD169-GFP for 5 days,
  then fixed. Using the Cytation and Gen5 software, infected GFP positive cells were
  counted per area of the well and plotted against drug concentration (avg±SEM, n=3).
  IC50 values were calculated in GraphPad Prism. Dotted line indicates average maximal
  GFP in untreated cells. (E-H) Fibroblasts were infected at an MOI of 3.0 in the
  presence of DMSO or 2.17 uM Regorafenib or Sorafenib, added at the time of viral
  adsorption. UN is an untreated control. Viral titers from (E) MRC5 or (F) HFF cells,
  were assessed by TCID50 (avg±SEM, n=3), 120 hpi, the dotted line indicates the limit
  of detection. In (G) MRC5 or (H) HFF cells, at 24 hours post-infection (hpi), phosphorylation
  of MEK and ERK was assessed by western blot
