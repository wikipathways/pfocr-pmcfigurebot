  docking analysis.
caption: Effects of daphnoretin on AKT based on network pharmacology and molecular
  docking analysis. (A) The overlapped daphnoretin-GBM targets were screened out by
  Venny 2.1.0. (B) The PPI network of the Daphnoretin-GBM targets were conducted by
  STRING database. (C) The GO functional enrichments of overlapped Daphnoretin-GBM
  targets were analyzed by R (v.3.6.3) software. (D) The KEGG pathway enrichments
  of overlapped Daphnoretin-GBM targets were performed by R (v.3.6.3) software. (E)
  The binding energy with PDB id of 5 combining conformations. The smaller of the
  binding energy value, the higher the accuracy. (F) Molecular docking results of
  daphnoretin with AKT1 was obtained by Autodock-VINA and Pymol software. (G) Different
  concentrations of daphnoretin associated with AKT as measured by SPR analysis. Data
  were presented as mean Â± SD or as a representative image, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
  ****P<0.0001 vs. the control group by oneway ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test or
  two-way RM ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test
