caption: 'Identification of differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) involved in
  H2S synthesis based on GC-MS analysis. (A) The number of DEMs identified in neck
  hair of male Bactrian Camels during estrus compared to ventral hair using non-targeted
  metabolomics analysis via the GC-MS method. (B) The number of DEMs enriched in metabolic
  pathways using KEGG annotation. (C) The number of pathways to which DEMs were mapped
  and enriched (p < 0.05) using KEGG annotation. (D) The top 20 enriched pathways
  in (C). (E) Heatmap showing the differential content of 26 amino acids using GC-MS
  analysis. NM: neck hair; VH: ventral hair. Red font indicates important DEMs in
  the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolic pathways, which are significant in
  relation to H2S synthesis. (F) The changes in cystathionine, glycine, serine, and
  threonine levels, related to H2S synthesis, in neck hair compared to ventral hair.
  (G) Venn diagram showing that CBS, CTH and cystathionine, glycine, serine, and threonine
  share the same metabolic pathway. Data are presented as median (rank)'
