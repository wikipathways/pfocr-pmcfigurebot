caption: Targeted intervention of the expression of mitogen‐activated protein kinase
  4 (MAPK4) could inhibit the growth of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor in
  vivo. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells (5 × 105) were subcutaneously injected into
  the right flanks of wild‐type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Tumors were collected on day 21.
  (a) Schematic diagram showing subcutaneously injection of LLC cells (5 × 105) into
  the right flanks of WT mice. Seven days later, the constructed PGL3.0 basic‐CD34
  promoter‐MAPK4 RNA interference (RNAi) eukaryotic expression vectors (termed as
  p‐siMAPK4) or p‐cont given by subcutaneous injection into the left flank of murine
  NSCLC tumor model three times every 3 days. Tumor growth was monitored every 2 days
  to generate the growth curve, and tumors were collected on day 14. (b) Tumor size.
  (c) Tumor volume and (d) tumor weight. (e) Tumor pathology was analyzed by hematoxylin‐eosin
  (H&E) staining. The arrows indicate neovascularization. (f–h) The expression of
  MAPK4 and CD34 in tumors was analyzed by immunofluorescence and quantitated. (i,
  j) Cell proliferation nuclear antigen (Ki67) expression in tumors was analyzed by
  immunofluorescence and quantitated. Representative data from three independent experiments
  were shown. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
