caption: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the tumor-infiltrating immune cells
  after OV-mOX40L treatment. A) All tumor-infiltrating immune cells from PBS and OV-mOX40L
  treated mice were clustered and showed as tSNE plots. Tumor-infiltrating immune
  cells were isolated from 3 mice per group and labeled with hashtag antibodies, then
  mixed in equal numbers for single-cell RNA sequencing. B) The proportions of intratumoral
  T and NK cells in the PBS and OV-mOX40L groups. C) GSEA pathway enrichment of OV-mOX40L
  versus PBS in individual CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, NK and NKT cell clusters. D)
  The proportions of myeloid cells in the PBS and OV-mOX40L groups. E) GSEA pathway
  enrichment of OV-mOX40L versus PBS in individual neutrophils, macrophages and cDC
  clusters. F) Expression of pro-inflammatory marker gene (Nos2) and immunosuppressive
  marker genes (Spp1 and Mrc1) in the tSNE plot
