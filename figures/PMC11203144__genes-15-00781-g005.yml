figure_title: Scatter plot of enrichment pathways of genes in the blue and red modules.
caption: 'Scatter plot of enrichment pathways of genes in the blue and red modules.
  Note: The horizontal coordinate is the ratio of the number of differential genes
  annotated to the total number of differential genes in the KEGG enrichment pathway,
  and the vertical coordinate is the KEGG enrichment pathway. The size of the dots
  in the graph represents the number of genes annotated to the KEGG enrichment pathway,
  and the colors from red to purple represent the significance size of the enrichment.
  (a) Blue module; (b) red module'
