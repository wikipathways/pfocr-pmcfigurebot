  Hippo signaling pathway.
caption: 'Mechanistic insights regarding the relationships between ATM and the Hippo
  signaling pathway. (A) Transcription fold-change of YAP target genes in ATM-knockout
  cells 24 h after exposure to 10 µM of LATSi, compared to no treatment control, as
  obtained from RNA-sequencing. Dark orange: YAP/TEADs targets. Light orange: other
  targets of the YAP transcription factor. Asterisks represent significance of differential
  expression analysis (p < 0.05). p = 4.7 × 10−5 in hypergeometric test. (B) Schematic
  model describing functional relationships between ATM-loss and the Hippo signaling
  pathway'
