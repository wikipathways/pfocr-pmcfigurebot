  analysis.
caption: Dendrobine synthesis-related gene screening by Venn diagram and KEGG analysis.
  (A) Venn distribution of DEGs for transcriptomes of different tissues (stem vs.
  root; leaf vs. root) from three Dendrobium species (D. houshanense; D. catenatum,
  and D. moniliforme). (B) KEGG pathway enrichment of 648 DEGs from (A). The x-axis
  represents the enrichment ratio and the y-axis represents the pathway name. (C)
  Venn diagram representation of the number of DEGs in samples from protocorm-like
  bodies (PLBs), samples under MF23 treatment, and the 648 DEGs in (A). (D) KEGG pathway
  enrichment of DEGs from (C)
