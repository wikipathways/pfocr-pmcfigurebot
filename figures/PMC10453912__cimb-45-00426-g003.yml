  Summarized signaling pathway of Toll-like receptor (MyD88: myeloid differentiation

  factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor; TAK1: TRAF6-induced transforming growth
  factor beta-activated kinase 1; MAPKs: mitogen-activated protein kinases; NF-κB:
  nuclear factor-κB; ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; JNK: c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase; AP-1: activator protein-1; RIP1: receptor-interacting serine/threonine
