caption: Pathway analysis of the DEMs. (a) Top 20 KEGG pathway results. p-values are
  represented by colors, while pathway impact is indicated by the size of the bubbles.
  (b) KEGG regulatory network diagram. Red circles represent individual metabolic
  pathways, yellow circles depict enzyme information related to specific substances,
  green circles indicate background substances for a metabolic pathway, purple circles
  represent information on molecular modules of a certain substance category, blue
  circles represent chemical interactions involving a specific substance, and green
  squares denote differentially expressed substances identified in this comparison
