figure_title: Comparison of enriched pathways in BIO 300 and vehicle-treated animals
  with or without TBI.
caption: Comparison of enriched pathways in BIO 300 and vehicle-treated animals with
  or without TBI. The top 20 pathways by z-score with Fisher’s exact test p < 0.05
  from mice treated with BIO 300 (200 mg/kg, BID) and with TBI were compared to Day
  0 and Day 1 of unirradiated animals treated with BIO 300 (200 mg/kg, BID) and vehicle-treated
  animals that were unirradiated or exposed to radiation. Shaded squares indicated
  z-score (blue, negative z-score; orange, positive z-score). Squares with an ‘X’
  indicate that the pathway was not enriched to any degree within the specified group.
  A black dot indicates that the absolute z-score value is >2
