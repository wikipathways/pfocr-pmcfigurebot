figure_title: Gender induces differential transcriptional metabolic profile.
caption: Gender induces differential transcriptional metabolic profile. TCGA datasets
  were broken into males and females. Differential gene expression was assessed comparing
  obese and non-obese patient sets within each sex. (A) Male ESCA assessment resulted
  in a large number of differentially expressed genes DEGs; adj. p < 0.05, |logFC|
  > 1.5, red) when comparing patients with BMI considered normal (left, light blue)
  to those considered overweight (right, dark blue). (B) Female ESCA assessment resulted
  in a large number of differentially expressed genes (adj. p < 0.05, |logFC| > 1.5,
  red) when comparing patients with BMI considered normal (left, light pink) to those
  considered overweight (right, dark pink). (C) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
  of male ESCA DEGs resulted in enrichment of cellular processes, metabolism, and
  epigenetic associated pathways. (D) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of female
  ESCA DEGs resulted in enrichment of similar cellular processes, and metabolism associated
  pathways. (E) Metabolic pipeline analysis resulted in enrichment of steroid, tryptophan,
  and other lipid metabolic pathways in males and females. (F) Comparison of the transcriptomics
  profiles of obese vs. non-obese patients, specifically the tryptophan metabolic
  pathway, in males (left) and females (right) demonstrated dysregulation of transcripts
  (triangles) in obese vs. normal weight patients, albeit to a different extent. Many
  of the transcripts were largely upregulated with obesity (red) in males and downregulated
  with obesity (blue) in females
