figure_title: KLF4 reduced ATP synthesis in HCC cells.
caption: KLF4 reduced ATP synthesis in HCC cells. (A) KEGG pathway analysis revealed
  the significantly affected signaling pathways in the TCGA database. (B) Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) of transcriptome data in the TCGA database revealed a
  negative correlation between levels of KLF4 and ATP synthesis. The normalized enrichment
  score (NES) and false-discovery rate (FDR) were used for analysis. (C) KLF4 suppressed
  the ATP concentration in HCC cells, as evaluated by the relative ATP concentration
  in the indicated group. (D) Effects of KLF4 on glycolysis in HCC cells determined
  by Seahorse ECAR analyzer. The extracellular acidification rate over time, glycolysis,
  glycolytic capability, and glycolytic reserve were shown. (E) Effects of KLF4 on
  oxidative phosphorylation in HCC cells determined by Seahorse XF analyzer. The oxygen
  consumption rate over time, basal respiration rate, ATP-linked respiration rate,
  and maximal respiration rate were shown. Statistical results are presented as mean
  ± SD (from triplicates), and significance was determined by Student’s t-test (*
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001)
