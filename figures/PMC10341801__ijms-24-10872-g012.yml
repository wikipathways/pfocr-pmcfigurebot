caption: 'The effect of CD on the expression of proteins involved in the NF-kB signaling
  pathway: NF-κB1 (A), NF-κB2 (B), IKBκB (C), RELA (D) and bands (E) representing
  the protein expression after four treatments (24 h). Graph bars show control, CD
  (6.25 µM), LPS and CD cotreatment (CD 1 h before) + LPS. Data representing protein
  expression as the mean ± SEM and the statistical significance of the difference
  between LPS and different treatments were determined using a one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s
  multiple comparison tests. * p ≤0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, ns = nonsignificant'
