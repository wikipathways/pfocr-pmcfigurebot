caption: Visualization of PathfindR analysis, gene-concept network, and Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways from differentially methylated regions (DMRs)
  between the two groups in female. (A) Heatmap of the enriched PathfindR terms. A
  total of 30 terms were retrieved, and the average cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG)
  methylation levels of each term is listed by a color scale. (B) Upset plot indicating
  the methylation patterns of 12 genes with 10 associated terms. (C) Network of the
  enriched terms and genes. The five nodes are the enriched terms, and the linked
  genes are connected as spokes. (D) The top 20 enriched KEGG pathways for DMRs
