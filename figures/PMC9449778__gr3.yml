caption: 'Prediction of a prolonged PR interval after catheter ablation of IAT using
  a 3D mapping system and electrophysiological findings. Leads V5 are shown with recordings
  from the HRA, LAS (pacing site for the PR interval prediction in this case), and
  CS. The arrows indicate the directions of the impulses. The red portions of the
  arrows indicate the intervals required to calculate the predicted PR. (A) During
  sinus rhythm, before catheter ablation, the impulses avoid certain obstacles; these
  obstacles include normal structures (e.g. the inferior vena cava, superior vena
  cava, and tricuspid valve) and abnormal structures (e.g. the postoperative incision
  and scars associated with an underlying cardiac disease). Pathway A: the impulse
  travels from the sinus node to the AV node in the shortest time. Pathway B: the
  impulse is expected to travel from the sinus node to the AV node after ablation.
  Pathway C: the pathway concealed by impulses through pathways A and B. If this pathway
  travels to the AV node at a speed faster than that of pathway B, the PR interval
  after the ablation will be shorter than the expected PR interval. If this pathway
  travels to the AV node at a speed slower than that of pathway B, the PR interval
  after the ablation will be the same as the expected PR interval. Impulses in pathway
  A collide with the wavefronts in pathways B and C. The time from the onset of the
  P wave to the peak of the QRS wave was 240 ms before catheter ablation. The conduction
  time from the HRA to the mapping catheter during sinus rhythm was 85 ms. (B) Impulses
  paced from the mapping catheter. The time from the mapping catheter to the peak
  of the QRS wave under pacing was 198 ms. (C) Conduction of impulses during sinus
  rhythm after ablation. The time from the onset of the P wave to the peak of the
  QRS wave was 280 ms after catheter ablation; this was similar to the expected PR
  interval (85 + 198 ms).AV, atrioventricular; CS, coronary sinus; 3D, three dimensional;
  HRA, high right atrium; IAT, incisional atrial tachycardia; LAS, low posterior atrial
  septum.'
