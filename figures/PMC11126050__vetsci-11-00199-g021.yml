figure_title: Inhibition of HER2 signalling.
caption: Inhibition of HER2 signalling. There are currently three types of HER2 inhibitors.
  (i) Trastuzumab and pertuzumab bind to HER2 at a single extracellular domain (Iâ€“IV).
  They exert anti-tumour effects by inhibiting downstream signalling pathways and
  engaging antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (pertuzumab, specifically, also
  functions by inhibiting receptor dimerization). (ii) Trastuzumab-emtansine and trastuzumab-deruxtecan
  are antibody-drug conjugates targeting HER2. They exert anti-tumour effects through
  the same pathways mentioned above, but in addition, they show targeted cytotoxicity
  by releasing a highly cytotoxic agent in the vicinity of HER2-positive tumour cells.
  (iii) Lapatinib and neratinib are small-molecule inhibitors. They exert anti-tumour
  effects by binding to the intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of HER2 and
  directly inhibiting PI3K pathway activation
