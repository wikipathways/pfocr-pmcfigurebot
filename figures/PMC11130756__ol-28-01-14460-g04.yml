caption: Role of miR-576-3p/MPP8 axis in HCC cells. The validity of MPP8 overexpression
  plasmid was confirmed by (A) RT-qPCR for mRNA expression and (B) western blotting
  for protein expression. (C) Western blotting used to detect the effect of up-regulating
  miR-576-3p on the PI3K/Akt pathway, and to detect the effect of MPP8 overexpression
  on miR-576-3p-mediated regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Rescue experiments with
  MPP8 overexpression were performed to determine whether MPP8 was involved in miR-576-3p-mediated
  regulation of the proliferation assessed by (D) CCK-8 and (E) colony formation assay,
  (F) migration assessed by wound-healing assay (scale bar, 200 µm) and (G) invasion
  assessed by Transwell invasion assay (scale bar, 50 µm) in HCC cells. *P<0.05 and
  **P<0.01 vs. corresponding control. MPP8, M-phase phosphoprotein 8; HCC, hepatocellular
