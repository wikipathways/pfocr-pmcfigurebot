caption: The peroxisomal FA β-oxidation gene daf-22 contributes to stress resilience
  in cbd-1(ok2913). (A) KEGG pathway analysis of genes differentially upregulated
  in cbd-1(ok2913). The top 10 terms are shown. (B) Relative expression of selected
  lipid catabolism genes in wild-type (WT) and cbd-1(ok2913) animals. Columns correspond
  to different biological samples analyzed by RNA sequencing. (C) Survival of wild-type
  (WT) or cbd-1(ok2913) animals grown on the indicated RNAi until day 2 of adulthood,
  subjected to a 4 h heat stress at 35°C, and scored following 72 h of recovery at
  20°C (n = 3). (D) Heat stress survival of wild-type or cbd-1(ok2913) animals grown
  on either control or daf-22 RNAi (n = 4). Error bars represent SEM. Statistical
  significance was based on two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett correction with comparison
  with the control condition within each group (strain) (C) or two-way ANOVA (D).
  (**) P < 0.01, (***) P < 0.001, (ns [nonsignificant]) P > 0.05.
