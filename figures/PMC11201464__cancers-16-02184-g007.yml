  cells before and after exposure to MK-0752 + gemcitabine + docetaxel. (A,B). The
  top 5 up (red) and downregulated (blue) KEGG pathways based on normalized enrichment
  scores and (C,D) the top 10 up- and downregulated significantly differentially expressed
  genes by log2 fold change after exposure to (A,C) DMSO vehicle control or (B,D)
  the combination of MK-0752, gemcitabine, and docetaxel at the IC30 for 72 h are
