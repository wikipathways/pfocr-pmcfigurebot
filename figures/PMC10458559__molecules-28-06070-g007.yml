figure_title: The effects of CEP on oxidative stress in LPS-induced NRF2−/− mice primary
  peritoneal macrophages.
caption: The effects of CEP on oxidative stress in LPS-induced NRF2−/− mice primary
  peritoneal macrophages. (A–C) Western blot analysis of the impact of CEP on the
  expression of HO-1 (B), and NQO-1 (C) signaling pathway in primary peritoneal macrophages
  from NRF2−/− mice, “ns” representative no significance (n = 3). (D–G) Western blot
  analysis of the impact of CEP on the phosphorylation of AMPK-α1, GSK-3β, and AKT
  signaling pathways in primary peritoneal macrophages from NRF2−/− mice (n = 3).
  (H) The GSH level in medium of CEP and LPS induced-primary peritoneal macrophages
  from NRF2−/− mice, “ns” representative no significance (n = 3). (I) The MDA level
  in medium of CEP and LPS induced-primary peritoneal macrophages from NRF2−/− mice,
  “ns” representative no significance, (n = 3). The results shown are means ± SEM,
