caption: KJ-Pyr-9, OUL35 and CID44216842 effectively inhibit the oncogenicity of human
  E2A-PBX1-associated pre-B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. (A) Schematic representation
  of xenograft development using human B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
  E2A-PBX1(+) RCH-ACV cells in zebrafish larvae. Briefly, embryos were injected with
  600 fluorescently labeled RCH-ACV cells into the posterior cardinal vein (PCV) or
  dorsal aorta (DA) at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf), followed by treatment with
  small molecules at 24 hours post-injection (hpi). The pre-B ALL cells injected in
  runx1w84x embryos were monitored by imaging at 12 hpi, 24 hpi, 72 hpi and 96 hpi.
  (B) RCH-ACV cells were calculated after xenografting into runx1w84x zebrafish at
  12 hpi, 24 hpi, 72 hpi and 96 hpi. (B’) Statistical analysis of the RCH-ACV cell
  number after injecting in panel (B). The black asterisks indicate statistical difference
  (N≥11, one-way ANOVA, mean ± standard error of the mean; **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001).
  (C) RCH-ACV cells were calculated after xenografting into runx1w84x zebrafish, followed
  by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 6.17 mM Ara-C (cytarabine), 8 μM KJ-Pyr-9,
  20 μM CID44216842 and 24 μM OUL35 at 96 hpi. (C’) Statistical analysis of the RCH-ACV
  cell number with drug treatment after injecting in panel (C). The black asterisks
  indicate statistical difference (N≥10, one-way ANOVA, mean ± standard error of the
  mean; ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001).
