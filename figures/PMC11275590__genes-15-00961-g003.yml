caption: Single-cell RNA sequencing of cells from human lung cancer patients supports
  non-homeostatic porphyrin production in cancer-associated fibroblasts. The data
  on single-cell lung cancer transcriptomes were retrieved from Zilionis et al. [65].
  The expression of the genes for the heme biosynthetic pathway enzymes and heme trafficking
  proteins was analyzed in diverse cell populations present in the tumor. The expression
  results associated with cancer cells from three different patients (Cancer_A n =
  203 cells, Cancer_B n = 766 cells, and Cancer_C n = 538 cells) are plottedâ€”HMBS
  and FLVCR1 show the most upregulated gene expression patterns. In the major groups
  of stromal and immune cell populations, most cell types have no evidence of porphyrin
  accumulation, while cancer-associated fibroblasts (n = 585) show evidence of porphyrin
  production with upregulation of HMBS (p < 0.05). Both HMBS and FLVCR1 are significantly
  different between tumor and stromal cell populations (p < 0.05). Color shading indicates
  normalized gene expression levels per gene, in a given cell population, and circle
  sizes indicate the percentage of cells in that population with detectable single-cell
  transcriptomes
