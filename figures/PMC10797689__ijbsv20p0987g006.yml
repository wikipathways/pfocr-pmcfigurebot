figure_title: Glutamine metabolism regulated the mTOR/MTFP1/DRP1 pathway to modulate
  mitochondria fission.
caption: Glutamine metabolism regulated the mTOR/MTFP1/DRP1 pathway to modulate mitochondria
  fission. (A) Western blot showed protein levels of the mitochondrial fission markers
  (MFF and FIS1). (B)and (C) Alterations in proteins involved in the mTOR/MTFP1/DRP1
  pathway were detected when glutamine was present. (D), (E) and (F) When RAPA was
  used to especially inhibit the mTOR activity, the levels of fibrotic markers (FN
  and COL1), MFF/FIS1, and mTOR/MTFP1/DRP1 pathway were examined by western blot.
  (G) MTFP1 overexpression plasmid was transfected into fibroblast to determine the
  relationship between MTFP1 and DRP1. Western blot showed the transfection efficiency
  of MTFP1 and the accordingly change of DRP1. (H) DRP1 expression was detected under
  MTFP1 overexpression by Western blot. *p < 0.05
