figure_title: The AJ pattern arises during cellularization and correlates with zygotic
  EGF signaling activity
caption: (A) Early stage 5 embryo stained for p120-Catenin. Dorsal-ventral regions
  shown in B are indicated.(B) Representative images of AJ formation in dorsal, lateral,
  and ventrolateral regions. Basal junctions (cyan arrows) move downwards into the
  yolk, and AJs (magenta arrows) form in a sub-apical position.(C) Quantification
  of DV junctional pattern of p120-Catenin over time during junction formation. Colors
  correspond to percent cellularization, a morphological proxy for time. n=3 or more
  embryos per stage; line represents mean junctional enrichment, plus or minus standard
  error.(D) EGF signaling pathway in the Drosophila embryo. The integral membrane
  protease, Rhomboid (magenta), cleaves the membrane-tethered ligand, Spitz (gray),
  which can act as a short-range morphogen to activate EGFR (blue) and downstream
  MAPK signaling (green).(E) Schematic of diffusion gradient model for Rho/ppMAPK
  signaling in the embryo.(F) Fluorescent in situ hybridization for rhomboid, the
  dorsally expressed morphgen dpp (BMP), and the mesoderm transcription factor, snail.(G)
  Antibody staining for di-phospho MAPK (green) and membrane (magenta).(H) Quantification
  of cytoplasmic intensity of rho mRNA expression (magenta) in comparison to di-phospho
  MAPK antibody staining. n=3 embryos; line represents mean junctional enrichment,
  plus or minus standard error.(I) Unwrapped projections of rho mRNA expression patterns
  in comparison to localization of translated Rho protein, ppMAPK staining, and E-Cadherin,
  at early (left) and late (right) stages
