caption: 'The structural architecture of Nrf2 and Keap1, and the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway.
  (A) Nrf2 consists of seven domains. (B) Keap1 contains five domains. (C) Under basal
  conditions, Nrf2 is bound with Keap1 and degraded in the cytosol. Under oxidative
  stress conditions, free Nrf2 is promoted and translocates into the nucleus and promotes
  the expression of downstream antioxidant genes. Some of the material in the image
  was sourced from BioRender.com, accessed on 24 July 2023. The black line in Figure
  1C represents promotion. antioxidant response element: ARE; Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1: Keap1; nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2: Nrf2; small musculoaponeurotic
  fibrosarcoma: sMAF; heme oxygenase 1: HO-1; NADP (H) quinone dehydrogenase 1: NQO1;
  glutathione-S-transferases: GSTs'
