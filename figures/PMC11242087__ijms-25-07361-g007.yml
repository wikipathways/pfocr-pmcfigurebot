figure_title: Changes in es-MMP14, es-MMP21 and es-CREB after knockdown or inhibition
  of the MAPK signaling pathway.
caption: Changes in es-MMP14, es-MMP21 and es-CREB after knockdown or inhibition of
  the MAPK signaling pathway. (A) Expression levels of es-MMP14 and es-MMP21 in the
  dsMAPK and inhibit-MAPK groups. (B) The analyses of es-MMP14 by using ImageJ2. (C)
  The analyses of es-MMP21 by ImageJ2. After the knockdown or inhibition of ERK and
  p38 MAPK, es-MMP14 reduced but es-MMP21 did not change, and the deficiency or inhibition
  of JNK did not change either es-MMPs. (D) Changes in the distribution of es-MMP14
  and es-MMP21 in the dsMAPK groups. (a,e) were the dsGFP group, (b,f) were the dsERK
  group, (c,g) were the dsJNK group and (d,h) were the dsp38 MAPK group. (E) Change
  in the distribution of es-MMP14 and es-MMP21 in the MAPK inhibitor treatment groups.
  (a,e) were the DMSO group, (b,f) were the U0126 group, (c,g) were the SP600125 group
  and (d,h) were the SB203580 group. the red signals represent es-MMP14 or es-MMP21.
  These parameters were not different from those of the control groups. (F) Expression
  level of es-CREB in the dsMAPK or inhibit-MAPK groups. (G) The results from (F)
  were examined by ImageJ2. The level of es-CREB decreased only when ERK was deleted
  or inhibited. (H) Detailed information on the site-specific mutagenesis of ERK,
  JNK and p38 MAPK. * p < 0.05 indicates a significant difference between two groups;
  ** p < 0.01 indicates an extremely significant difference; *** p < 0.001 indicate
  an extremely significant difference. ‘ns’ indicates that there was no significant
  change. The bars in (D,E) represent 50 μm
