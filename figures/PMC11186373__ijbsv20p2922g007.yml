caption: Na+ enters the cell through Slc6a12 transporter to activate SGK1 and activate
  MAPK signaling pathway to promote macrophage pyroptosis. (a) Western blot analysis
  of Caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1β protein expression of RAW264.7 cells after adding
  magnesium chloride, sodium chloride and sodium gluconate. (b) The SoNa 520 AM system
  was used to assay the effect of the Slc6a12 inhibitor BPDBA on Na+ influx into THP-1-derived
  macrophages. (c) The effects of Slc6a12 inhibitor (BPDBA) on Sodium-activated p38
  MAPK/NF-κB and were detected by western blot. (d) Scatter plot and regression line
  between serum sodium content and anti-cyclic citrulline antibody value in RA patients.
  (e) Correlation analysis between serum Sodium level and erythrocyte sedimentation
  rate in patients with RA and OA. (f) In SGK1-deficient macrophages pretreated by
  LPS + NaCl followed by SGK1 overexpression or BPDBA treatment, western blot was
  used to detect the effects of pyroptosis, NF-κB p65 and MAPK p38 related protein
  expression. (g) ELISA was used to detect IL-1β and IL-18 levels in culture supernatants
  of SGK1-deficient macrophages under SGK1 rescue or BPDBA treatment. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD, n=5
