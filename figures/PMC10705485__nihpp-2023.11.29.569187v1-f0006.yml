figure_title: Proposed model of effects of blood-feeding on tRNA in the fat body
caption: Before blood-feeding, the tRNA pool is stable and Q/manQ is modified in the
  fat body to meet the codon demand of housekeeping transcripts. Post blood-feeding,
  the TOR signaling pathway is activated and vitellogenin transcripts are increased
  (Attardo et al., 2005). Enrichment of tyrosine codons in vitellogenin requires a
  new set of tRNAs. Therefore, pretRNA are remodeled to enrich Tyr tRNA. The increase
  of tRNA transcripts is also reflected in the mature tRNA. The rapid increase of
  Tyr tRNA likely results in higher transcripts that are undermodified at the wobble
  position, which lowers the relative abundance of wobble modifications associated
  with Tyr tRNA
