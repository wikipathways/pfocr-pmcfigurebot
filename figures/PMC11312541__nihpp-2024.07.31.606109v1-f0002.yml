figure_title: Comparison of the activity of VHPOs on small molecule substrates and
  the sources of the substrates.
caption: Comparison of the activity of VHPOs on small molecule substrates and the
  sources of the substrates. Endogenously produced bioactive natural product substrates
  in which the VHPO plays an established role in the biosynthetic pathway (red).8â€“10
  Substrates encountered exogenous to the VHPO-producing organism and the respective
  chemical transformations catalyzed (blue).4 The reaction catalyzed by HZ11-VHPO
  has the potential to brominate both endogenously and exogenously produced AQs (purple).11
  This work (blue box) expands the AQ-VHPO homologs as a broader subfamily that modify
  exogenously produced QS substrates
