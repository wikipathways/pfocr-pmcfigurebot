figure_title: Effect of FABP5-KO on malignant characteristics of PC3M and on levels
  of the downstream proteins of the FABP5 signalling pathway.
caption: Effect of FABP5-KO on malignant characteristics of PC3M and on levels of
  the downstream proteins of the FABP5 signalling pathway. (A) Microscopical images
  of PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO cells. (B) Proliferation rates of PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO
  cells over the course of the 6-day experimental period. (C) Images of invasive cells
  from PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO at the end of the 6-day experimental period. (D) The
  average numbers of invasive cells from PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO cells. (E) Images
  of colonies in soft agar formed by PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO cells. (F) Average numbers
  of colonies in soft agar formed by PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO cells. (G) Images of wounds
  in PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO cells at the different times. (H) Quantitative assessment
  of the average size of wound space gap (μm) in PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO cells. (I)
  Western blot analysis of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 in PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO cells. (J)
  Relative levels of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. Levels of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 in PC3M were each
  set at '1', and the levels in PC3M-FABP5-KO cells were obtained by comparing with
  those in PC3M. (K) Western blots of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2 in PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO
  cells. (L) Relative levels of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2. Levels of pPPARγ1 and pPPARγ2
  in PC3M cells were each set at '1', and the levels in PC3M-FABP5-KO cells were obtained
  by comparing with those in PC3M. (M) Western blot analysis of VEGF in PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO
  cells was performed. (N) The relative level of VEGF. The level of VEGF in PC3M cells
  was set at '1', and the level of VEGF in the PC3M-FABP5-KO cells was obtained by
  comparing with that in the PC3M cells. (O) Western blot analysis of ARFL and ARV7
  in the PC3M and PC3M-FABP5-KO cells. Since only ARFL was present, and no ARV7 was
  detected, no quantification of the data was possible. The relative protein levels
  were reproduced independently three times, and the differences were assessed by
  Student's t-test. **P<0.001, ***P<0.0001 and ****P<0.00001. KO, knockout; FABP5,
  fatty acid-binding protein 5; AR, androgen receptor; ARFL, full-length AR; ARV7,
  AR splicing variant 7; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; pPPARγ,
  phosphorylated PPARγ; VEGF, vascular endothelium growth factor; ns, not statistically
  significant
