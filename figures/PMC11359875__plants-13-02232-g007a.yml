caption: UV-B-induced metabolic pathway rearrangement network in R. Chrysanthum. (a)
  Simplified modeling of amino acid-related metabolic pathways exposed to UV-B radiation.
  The contents of the involved metabolites are presented as heatmaps after data normalization,
  where the red and green arrows on the left side of the heatmaps positively represent
  increases and decreases in metabolite contents after UV-B radiation, respectively,
  and “*” indicates that the relevant metabolites changed significantly. The three
  adjacent squares in the left half of the heatmaps represent the expression of each
  metabolite from three replicate experiments (n = 3) in group M, and the three adjacent
  squares in the right half of the heatmaps represent the expression of each metabolite
  from three replicate experiments in group N. (b) Simplified modeling of JA production
  and signaling pathways following exogenous ABA treatment. The three adjacent squares
  in the left half of the heatmaps represent the expression of each metabolite from
  three replicate experiments (n = 3) in group N, and the three adjacent squares in
  the right half of the heatmaps represent the expression of each metabolite from
  three replicate experiments in group Q. The heights of the bars in the graph depict
  the means of the three biological duplicate experiments (n = 3), while the error
  bars depict the standard deviations of the samples. Different letter markers indicate
  significant differences across data groups (p < 0.05)
