caption: Cis-regulatory element analysis reveals distinct responses to light between
  the conserved genes and SS-miRNAs involved in the abscission pathway. (A) Three
  SS-miRNAs in I. latifolia regulate four target genes, HSL2, MKK5, ALG18, and EVR,
  involved in the signaling pathway of organ abscission. (B,C) Cis-regulatory element
  analysis on the promoters of three SS-miRNAs and their target genes (B) and the
  corresponding description of each element (C). The cis-regulatory elements on the
  four target genes and the three SS-miRNAs are marked in orange and blue, respectively
