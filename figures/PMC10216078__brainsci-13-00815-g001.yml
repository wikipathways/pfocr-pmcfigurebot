caption: 'Glutamatergic and opioidergic signaling mediates the induction of synaptic
  plasticity in GABAergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The LTP of
  the VTA GABAergic neurons, which is heterosynaptic, may be triggered by the NOâ€“cGMP
  signaling pathway via the activation of the adjacent glutamatergic neurons. Following
  the stimulation of NMDA receptors (1), NO as a retrograde messenger (2, 3, and 4)
  increases the presynaptic GABA release to induce GABA LTP, which may require the
  balance of neuronal firing in the VTA dopaminergic neurons. On the other hand, activation
  of the mu-opioid receptors (5), while inhibiting the activation of voltage-gated
  calcium channels, increases the outflow of K+ current via activation of the presynaptic
  potassium channels. The general effects are blocking GABA release, changing the
  pattern of action potential, and inducing hyperpolarization in the VTA presynaptic
  GABAergic neurons. Abbreviations: cyclic guanosine monophosphate, cGMP; gamma-aminobutyric
  acid, GABA; long-term potentiation, LTP; nitric oxide, NO; N-methyl-D-aspartate,
  NMDA; ventral tegmental area, VTA'
