figure_title: Venn diagram and network analysis.
caption: 'Venn diagram and network analysis. (A) Venn diagram to show the overlapping
  highly significant regulated miRNA from PTCs and their EVs. Only three miRNAs (miR-146a-5p,
  miR-147b, and miR-155-5p) overlapped between the two groups (Venny 2.1.0). (B,C)
  Network analyses showing miRNA target interactions. Network visualization: miR (blue
  squares) and the potentially interacting gene network (magenta and green dots) created
  with miRNet 2.0 (miRTarBase). (B) Dissected miRNAâ€“target interactions and functional
  associations through network-based visual analysis (miRNet). miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p,
  and miR-147b regulate 1092 genes, including ICAM1 and IL6. (C) Interaction and targets
  involved in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway'
