caption: AEBP1 knockdown suppressed the activation of NF‐κB signaling pathway in IL‐1β‐treated
  chondrocytes. (A) The protein levels of p‐IκBα (Ser32), IκBα, p‐p65 (Ser536), and
  p65 in chondrocytes with IL‐1β treatment after AEBP1 knockdown. (B) Representative
  images of immunofluorescence staining for p65 in chondrocytes with IL‐1β treatment
  after AEBP1 knockdown. Scale bar = 50 μm. The focused part of the dotted frame on
  images was magnified to 200%. (C) The interaction between AEBP1 and IκBα was assessed
  by a Co‐IP assay. (D) The protein level of IκBα in chondrocytes treated with CHX
  for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 h. (E) The protein level of IκBα in chondrocytes treated with
  CHX after AEBP1 knockdown. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. AEBP1, adipocyte enhancer binding
  protein 1; CHX, cycloheximide; Co‐IP, co‐immunoprecipitation; OA, osteoarthritis.

  through inhibiting NF‐κB signaling pathway‐mediated inflammation and extracellular
  matrix degradation.
