  pathway in Aquilaria sinensis in response to mechanical wounding.
caption: 'Analysis of expression of genes involved in the sesquiterpene biosynthetic
  pathway in Aquilaria sinensis in response to mechanical wounding. FPKM values of
  the individual genes were normalized across the rows and the heatmap was visualized
  in R. Each row represents the normalized gene expression level and each column represents
  different conditions (in order represented in the horizontal scale). HMGS: hydroxymethylglutarylâˆ’CoA
  synthase; HMGR: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; MK: melalonate
  kinase; PMK: phosphomevalonate kinase; IDI: isopentyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase;
  FPPS: farnesyl diphosphate synthase; TPS: terpene synthase; DXS: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
  synthase'
