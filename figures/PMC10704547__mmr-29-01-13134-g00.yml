figure_title: AhR ligand-activated pathways mediate anticancer activities in breast
  cancer cells.
caption: AhR ligand-activated pathways mediate anticancer activities in breast cancer
  cells. In triple-negative breast cancer cells, the tumor suppressor characteristics
  exhibited by different types of AhR ligand may be related to the downregulation
  of CXCR4, the miR-212/132/SOX4 signaling axis, the JAG1/NOTCH1 signaling pathway
  and the TGF-β signaling pathway. In estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells,
  the tumor-suppressive characteristics of different types of AhR ligand may be associated
  with the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and the inhibition of the
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, FAK and the expression of MMPs. In addition, a number
  of AhR ligands may disrupt the interaction between CDK4 and AhR to induce cell cycle
  arrest in breast cancer cells. (a) The signal pathway involved in AhR ligand in
  TNBC cells, such as MDA-MB-231 cells. (b) The signal pathway involved in AhR ligand
  in ER-positive breast cancer cells, such as MCF-7 cells. β-NF, β-naphthoflavone;
