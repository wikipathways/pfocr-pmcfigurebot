caption: The schematic of CTKs signaling pathway. The CHASE domain of HK receptor
  binds CTKs and induces the histone-kinase domain phosphorylation. This is followed
  by multiple phosphoryl transfers, including from His to Asp, from Asp to radical
  His in the presence of AHPs, and from radical His to RRs in the nucleus, ultimately
  triggering transcriptional changes. The dotted line arrows indicate the transfer
  of substances, and the thick arrows indicate the facilitation of processes [66]
