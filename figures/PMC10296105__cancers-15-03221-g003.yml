figure_title: Nigericin treatment leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.
caption: Nigericin treatment leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. (A) Changes in intracellular
  potassium level in TNBC cells before and after nigericin treatment (2 μg/mL for
  6 h), as detected via ICP-MS. Bar graphs stand for mean ± SD of experimental triplicates
  (t-test, * p < 0.05). (B) Mitochondrial membrane potential changes in TNBC cells
  (nigericin 2 μg/mL for 6 h), as detected via JC-1 probes. At high mitochondrial
  membrane potential, JC-1 aggregated and yielded red-colored emission (590 nm). At
  low mitochondrial membrane potential, JC-1 was predominantly a monomer that yielded
  green-colored emission (530 nm). (C) Metabolites screened via mass spectrometry
  in 4T1 cells with or without nigericin treatment. Metabolic pathway enrichment of
  differential metabolites was performed based on Metaboanalyst (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca
  (accessed on 31 October 2020)). (D,E) Nigericin significantly impacted mitochondrial
  metabolism. (D) Metabolites of TCA cycle and (E) oxidative phosphorylation upon
  nigericin treatment detected via mass spectrometry. Bar graphs stand for mean ±
  SD of experimental quadruplicates (t-test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
