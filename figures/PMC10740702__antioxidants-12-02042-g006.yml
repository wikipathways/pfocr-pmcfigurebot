caption: Effects of different supplemental levels of coenzyme Q10 on the expression
  of hepatopancreatic immune-related genes (Toll-like receptor signaling pathway)
  of L. vannamei under acute hypoxia stress. The results are expressed as the mean
  and error vertical bar (SEM); 4 replications in each group (n = 4). a,b,c,d shown
  above the error bars indicate significant differences among groups; different letters
  displayed on top indicated significant differences (p < 0.05); same letters mean
  no significant difference (p > 0.05)
