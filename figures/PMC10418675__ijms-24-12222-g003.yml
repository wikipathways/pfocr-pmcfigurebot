caption: Drug resistance management. Strategies used to manage and overcome drug resistance
  are depicted in this picture. (1) Earlier detection of actionable genomic modifications
  using ctDNA is a powerful tool to predict cancer recurrence influencing more effective
  treatment decision-making that results in a better response to treatment. (2 and
  3) Immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors, can be used as monotherapy or in
  combination to simultaneously target multiple pathways and increase treatment effectiveness.
  (4) Mapping cancer dependencies using DeepMap is an effective approach to predicting
  genes responsible for drug resistance and identifying new genetic targets, thereby
  facilitating the discovery of drugs that can potentially overcome resistance. Created
