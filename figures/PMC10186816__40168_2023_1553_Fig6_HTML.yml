caption: Metabolic potentials of PW microbiomes in sulfur and nitrogen cycles as well
  as hydrocarbon biodegradation. The relative abundance of signature genes encoding
  enzymes associated with the respective pathway in PW microbiomes from various stages
  was expressed as TPM (total transcripts per million) and represented by color blocks
  that correspond to the PW of June, July, August 3rd, August 11th, and September
  (from left to right). a Metabolic potential predictions of sulfur-cycling pathways,
  including dissimilatory sulfate reduction, thiosulfate oxidation and reduction,
  assimilatory sulfate reduction, and sulfide oxidation. b Metabolic potential predictions
  of six distinct nitrogen-cycling pathways, including dissimilatory nitrate reduction,
  denitrification, assimilatory nitrate reduction, nitrogen fixation, nitrification,
  and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). The genes responsible for nitrification
  and anammox were not detected. Multiple NR-SOB can channel electron transfer between
  nitrate reduction and sulfide oxidation. c The metabolic capacity of MAG members
  and PW microbiomes from various stages. The left heatmap shows the aggregated abundance
  of all signature genes encoding the individual metabolic pathway in PW microbiomes.
  The right heatmap gives the presence percentage of signature genes involved in metabolic
  pathways across 43 reconstructed high-quality draft genomes spanning 9 phyla. Abundance
  was normalized by the completeness of MAGs to eliminate the influence of incomplete
  assembly on the prediction of gene presence
