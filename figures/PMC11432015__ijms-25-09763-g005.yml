figure_title: Modulation of the GR/PLC/PKC pathway by β-cyc in PC12 cells.
caption: 'Modulation of the GR/PLC/PKC pathway by β-cyc in PC12 cells. (A–C) Effects
  of inhibitors of GR, PLC, and PKC (RU486, U73343, and Go6983) on the neurite outgrowth
  induced by β-cyc, its combination with low-dose NGF, and NGF 1 ng/mL. (D,E) Western
  blotting and digitalized result of p-GR, GR in dose-dependent (D) and time-dependent
  (E) experiments induced by β-cyc. (F) The induction of phosphorylation in GR, PLC,
  and PKC by β-cyc and RU486. (G) The induction of phosphorylation in PLC and PKC
  by β-cyc and U73343. (H) Phosphorylation of PKC by β-cyc and Go6983. Each experiment
  was repeated three times. The data were expressed as a mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001, compared with the negative control; # p < 0.05, ## p
  < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001, compared with the 3 µM β-cyc group; $ p < 0.05 and $$ p
  < 0.01, compared with the combination group of β-cyc with low-dose NGF; & p < 0.05,
  compared with the low-dose NGF, ns indicates no significant difference, compared
  with the low-dose NGF'
