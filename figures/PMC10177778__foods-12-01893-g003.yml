figure_title: Xylose assimilation and its metabolism in the pentose interconversion.
caption: 'Xylose assimilation and its metabolism in the pentose interconversion. Only
  xylose uses this metabolic pathway from among the CS tested. Up-regulated genes
  when using xylose: xylT (corresponding to symporter) and the operon xylAB (corresponding
  to xylose isomerase XylA, and xylulose kinase XylB). XylR is the regulatory element
  that effects over xylT, xylA and xylB'
