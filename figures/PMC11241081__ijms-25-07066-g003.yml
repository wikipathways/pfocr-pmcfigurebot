caption: The mechanism of the photoreceptors sensing, signaling, and regeneration.
  For each plant photoreceptor, the basic mechanism of the photo sensing is indicated
  (it can be either monomerization, dimerization, or conformational changes), together
  with the light region that induced the active state of photoreceptors, and the signaling
  pathway where the light signal is further propagated (the related literature is
  cited in the text accompanying this scheme)
