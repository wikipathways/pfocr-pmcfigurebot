caption: Oncogenic signaling can drive changes in the transcription of tRNA genes.
  Oncogenic signaling pathways such as AKT, mTOR, RAS-MAPK, and MYC can cause alterations
  in tRNA gene transcription, resulting in an overall increase in tRNA expression.
  This, in turn, may encourage the translation of tumor-promoting mRNAs based on codon
  use bias, in which mRNAs with codons that match the tRNA pool are more likely to
  be translated. For example, the tRNA pools of cancer cells correspond to the codon
  use of transcripts involved in cell proliferation and cycle
