figure_title: Effect of EHG on the inflammatory signaling pathway in colon tissues
  of mice with DSS-induced colitis.
caption: 'Effect of EHG on the inflammatory signaling pathway in colon tissues of
  mice with DSS-induced colitis. (A) Protein expression levels of iNOS and COX-2,
  as well as the phosphorylation status of NF-κB, in the colon was assessed using
  immunoblotting analysis. (B) Relative protein level of protein band was quantified
  by densitometry using image analysis. The density of iNOS and COX-2 was normalized
  by β-actin and phosphorylated NF-κB normalized to the total NF-κB. N (normal), NC
  (negative control; 5% DSS), EHG (EHG + 5% DSS), and PC (positive control; 5% DSS
  + 5-ASA) groups are shown. All values represent the mean ± SD (n = 7/group). The
  data obtained were subjected to analysis using Duncan’s multiple comparison test.
