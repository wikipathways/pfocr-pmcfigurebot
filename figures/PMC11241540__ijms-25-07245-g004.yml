figure_title: Metabolic overview of DEGs using MapMan.
caption: 'Metabolic overview of DEGs using MapMan. The 1222 differentially expressed
  genes were used to visualize the changes in the metabolic pathways. One gene could
  have more than one classification. The up-regulated steps are represented in blue,
  and the down-regulated steps are in red. (A) The metabolic-related genes are further
  divided as cell wall, lipid, secondary metabolism, amino acid, light, major carbohydrate,
  minor carbohydrate (minor CHO), glycolysis, and a few for fermentation, the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, S-assimilation, nucleotide metabolism, tetrapyrrole synthesis,
  or mitochondrial electron transport. (B) Cell function overview. The considered
  categories were: classification in cell division and cell cycle, DNA repair, DNA
  synthesis, cell organization, vesicle transport and protein targeting, stress biotic
  and abiotic, RNA synthesis, regulation of transcription, RNA processing, protein
  synthesis and AA activation, development, hormones, regulation, protein modification,
  protein degradation, transport, metal handling, redox, enzyme families and unclassified
  (no ontology or unknown)'
