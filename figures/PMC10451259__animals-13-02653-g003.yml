caption: Reverse targets prediction, KEGG pathway analysis, and validation of the
  Asi targets. (A) Flow chart of reverse target finding. (B) KEGG analysis of potential
  targets. (C) Relative mRNA expression in adipose (n = 6–8). (D) Relative mRNA expression
  in liver (n = 6–8). (E) Protein of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway genes were detected
  by Western blotting (n = 3). All the results are shown as the means ± SEM; * p <
  0.05, ** p < 0.01
