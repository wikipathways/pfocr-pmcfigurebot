caption: The potential mechanism by which CVC restores the immune cell landscape.
  Murine livers from the prevention experiment were subjected to scRNA-seq to determine
  the immune cell landscape. (A-C) A heatmap of the top 20 downregulated and upregulated
  DEGs in macrophages of the CCl4 and CVC groups (A), KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  for all DEGs (B), and a heatmap of RSS in macrophages of the three groups (C) were
  determined. (D-F) A heatmap of the top 20 downregulated and upregulated DEGs in
  neutrophils of the CCl4 and CVC groups (D), KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for
  all DEGs (E), and a heatmap of RSS in neutrophils of the three groups (F) were displayed.
  (G) The heatmap of RAS for the whole liver in the integrated three groups was shown.
  (H) The transcription factor network analysis in the integrated three groups was
  revealed
