caption: 'TRQ inhibited certain stem cell markers related to resistance to gefitinib
  by modulating ROS levels. (A, B) Western blotting assay was used to detect the protein
  levels of SOX2 and ALDH1A1 in lung cancer cell lines after gefitinib treatment.
  (C, D) Western blotting assay was used to detect the protein levels of SOX2 and
  ALDH1A1 in lung cancer cell lines after TRQ treatment. (E, F) Western blotting assay
  was used to detect the protein levels of SOX2 and ALDH1A1 after treated with gefitinib,
  TRQ, NAC alone or together in 2D cell lines. (G, H) Western blotting assay was used
  to detect the protein levels of SOX2 and ALDH1A1 after treated with gefitinib, TRQ,
  NAC alone or together in 3D cell spheres. Data were shown as means Â± SD of three
  independent experiments. *P or #P < 0.05, **P or ##P < 0.01, ***P or ###P < 0.001.
  Ctrl, the control group; TRQ, Tanreqing injection; Gefi, gefitinib; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine;
  PC-9-PIK3CA-M, PC-9-PIK3CA-mutation; SOX2, sex determining region Y-box 2; ALDH1A1,
  aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 memberA1.'
