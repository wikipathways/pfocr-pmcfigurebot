figure_title: AEP promotes oncogenic splicing of widespread pre-mRNAs via tDDX3X-C
caption: '(A and B) GSEA of the expression profile of the NOD-like signaling pathway
  and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway in U87-MG cells (AEP KD or AEP KD/tDDX3X-C
  res). (C) Heatmap for gene sets of the Toll-like signaling pathway and the NOD-like
  signaling pathway regulated by AEP/tDDX3X-C. (D) Summary of differential splicing
  analysis performed using U87-MG cells in the following groups: NC, AEP KD, and AEP
  KD/tDDX3X-C res. The numbers of identified AS events in each category upon AEP/tDDX3X-C
  regulation are indicated. (E) Pie charts showing the percentages of changed AS events
  identified in U87-MG cells (left); pie charts representing the distribution of AEP/tDDX3X-C-regulated
  splicing events among different splicing profiles (right). (F) Representative heatmap
  for changed AS events from skipped exons (SEs) positively regulated by AEP/tDDX3X.
  (G) RNA-Seq results of alternative sites in the indicated genes using IGV software
  analysis. (H) PCR and AGE analyses for PRDM2 exon 2 and ARRB1 exon 13 regulated
  by AEP/tDDX3X-C in U87-MG and MDA-MB-231 cells. The middle panels show schematic
  diagrams of the indicated AS exons. Right panels show the quantification of percent
  spliced in (PSI). (I) PCR and AGE analyses for PRDM2 exon 2 and ARRB1 exon 13 in
  U87-MG and MDA-MB-231 cells with or without hypoxia and nutrient deprivation stimulus
  for 4 hours. (J) RNA-IP results of U87-MG and MDA-MB-231 cells (Flagged-tDDX3X-C
  OE) with or without hypoxia and nutrient deprivation stimulus for 4 hours. Data
  were plotted as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using 1-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (H), paired t test (I), and unpaired
  t test (J). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Data shown are
  representative of 3 independent experiments'
