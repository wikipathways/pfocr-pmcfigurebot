caption: Requirement of E-D pathway genes for growth on glucose or gluconate as a
  sole carbon source. Indicated strains with specified plasmid were serial 10-fold
  diluted and 5 ÂµL were spotted on the plates with the specified carbon source and
  1 mM IPTG to induce the tac promoter on the plasmid
