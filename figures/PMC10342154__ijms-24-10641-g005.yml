caption: Hierarchical cluster analysis of ABA-related genes in transcriptome. The
  FPKM value was normalized by log10 (FPKM + 1) and clustered. Red indicates highly
  expressed genes and blue indicates poorly expressed genes. The color change from
  red to blue indicates a descending gene expression level. (A) Expression pattern
  of genes related to ABA metabolism and biosynthesis. (B) Expression pattern of genes
  related to ABA transport and signaling pathway. (C) Expression pattern of ERFs (Ethylene
  Response Factors) found in OE and WT with or without ABA treatment
