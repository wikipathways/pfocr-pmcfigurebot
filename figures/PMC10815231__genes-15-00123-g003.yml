caption: Mechanisms of action of ncRNAs in CKD. (A) miR-30 expression is downregulated
  in the myocardium in the presence of CKD, causing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by increasing
  calcineurin signaling. (B) Exosomes reduce renal fibrosis by delivering anti-let-7i-5p,
  inhibiting the EMT process and prompting the activation of the TSC1/mTOR signaling
  pathway. (C) miR-381-3p was associated with apoptosis and calcification due to the
  decrease of miR-381-3p and NFAT5 (target gene of miR-381-3p) in high phosphate-stimulated
  human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HA-VSMCs) and 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy
  (SNx) rat models
