figure_title: Structures of different conformational states of the DraNramp Mn2+ transport
  cycle
caption: (A) Crystal structures of each state of DraNramp. TMs 1 and 6 are colored
  green, TMs 5 and 10 are colored pale yellow, TMs 2, 7, and 11 in gray and TMs 3,
  4, 8, and 9 are light blue. The Mn2+ ion in the orthosteric site, when present,
  is shown as a magenta sphere. (B) Corresponding 2Fo-Fc maps contoured at 1σ for
  TMs 1 and 6 of each structure illustrated in A.
article_title: High-resolution structures with bound Mn2+ and Cd2+ map the metal import
  pathway in an Nramp transporter.
