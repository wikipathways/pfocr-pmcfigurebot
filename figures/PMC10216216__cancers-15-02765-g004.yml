caption: (a) Cellularity changes dynamics of CD44-CD24+ T47D and BT-474 cell cultures
  after cisplatin treatment; on the abscissa—time, days. (b) Dedifferentiation induction
  of CD44-CD24+ tumour cells of T47D and BT-474 lines after cisplatin treatment; arrows
  show mammospheres. (c) Differential-expressing WNT signalling pathway genes at 21
  days incubation in CD44-CD24+ cells after cisplatin treatment and wild type cells
  after cisplatin treatment; red—CD44-CD24+ expression is higher than in wild type
  cells, green—vice versa
