figure_title: Upregulation of Tim-3 expression on Tregs by IL-27/Blimp-1 axis
caption: '(A) Schematic representation of in vitro culture strategy divided into 3
  groups (n = 6): Treg alone (Treg group), Treg + IL-27 (IL-27 group) and Treg + Trophoblast
  supernatant (Tro-sup group). (B) Representative diagram for FCM and comparison of
  the proportions of Foxp3+CD4+ T cells, Tim-3+ Tregs, and Tim-3+Blimp-1+ Tregs after
  5 days of culture in 3 groups. (C) Schematic diagram illustrating IL-27 downstream
  signaling pathways. (D) Detection of mRNA levels of IL-27 downstream signaling molecules,
  including MAPK, PI3K, STAT1, STAT3, and AKT. (E) Detection of the protein levels
  of IL-27 downstream signaling molecules by Western blotting (WB). (F) Detection
  of phosphorylated Stat1 and phosphorylated Stat3 levels by FCM. (G) ELISA measurement
  of IL-27 levels in plasma and decidua from NP, PW, and RPL groups. NP, normal pregnancy;
  PW, 1 to 2 years postpartum after a normal delivery; RPL, recurrent pregnancy loss.
  (H) Detection of Blimp-1 expression in decidua by qPCR, WB, and IHC staining in
  NP and RPL groups. The upper row shows the view under ×200 original magnification
  (scale bar: 200 μm), and the lower row shows the corresponding magnified view under
  ×400 original magnification (scale bar: 100 μm). Data are represented as the mean
  ± SEM via 1-way ANOVA test (B and G) and unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s t test (D
  and H). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001'
