caption: 'Schematic illustration highlighting targets of senotherapeutics including
  senolytics and senomorphics. Senolytics induce apoptosis in senescent cells by targeting
  key enzymes involved in anti-apoptotic and pro-survival mechanisms, such as tyrosine
  kinase (TK), p53, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins, serine/threonine protein
  kinase (AKT), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and forkhead box O protein (FOXO).
  Dasatinib is a TK inhibitor able to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis.
  (Figure 3) Quercetin is a flavonoid, which interacts with a PI3K isoform and Bcl-2
  family members. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) and urokinase-type
  plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) are seno-antigens broadly expressed on senescent
  cells. Peptide vaccination against GPNMB and CAR-T cells directed against uPAR can
  remove senescent cells. Senomorphics suppress SASP cell function by neutralizing
  SASP components or by interacting with their transcriptional regulators. Rapamycin
  inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and decreases nuclear
  factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity to reduce interleukin 1α (IL-1α) production. Metformin
  and statins inhibit the mTOR signaling pathway. Aspirin increases nitric oxide synthesis
  and decreases oxidative stress, consequently up-regulates telomerase activity. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme
  inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs, formally AT1R blockers)
  prevent telomeric and non-telomeric deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage of angiotensin
  II through reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated oxidative stress. Resveratrol
  activates sirtuins that regulate cellular senescence via targeting NF-κB transcription
  factors. Cytokine targeting therapy includes Xilonix, which is a monoclonal antibody
  specifically targeting IL-1α; canakinumab, which is a selective monoclonal antibody
  against interleukin 1β (IL-1β); anakinra, which is an IL-1 receptor antagonist;
  and tocilizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor. Colchicine
  exerts broad anti-inflammatory effects, such as inhibition of IL-1 release. Methotrexate
  inhibits the p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38/MAPK) pathway, however, it
  did not prove beneficial in patients with cardiovascular disease. NADPH oxidase:
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase, Na-K ATPase: sodium-potassium adenosine
  triphosphatase, JAK: Janus kinase, STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription'
