caption: Analyzing immune cell populations through single-cell RNA sequencing. (A
  and B) Utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, the distribution of immune
  cell populations is illustrated in the public dataset and the GSE148673 dataset,
  respectively. (C and D) Utilizing the UMAP technique, BRCA cells are visually represented,
  with colors indicating predominant cell type and malignancy status. (E & G) Expression
  levels of MiCU1/2 across different cell clusters are depicted using violin and UMAP
  plots. (H) Results of GSEA for G2M checkpoint, IL2/STAT5 signaling, and inflammatory
  response signaling pathways in gene expression clusters
