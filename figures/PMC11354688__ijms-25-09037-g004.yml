figure_title: A summarized process of the biosynthesis of cholesterol.
caption: A summarized process of the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Cholesterol is either
  absorbed through diet uptake or more often produced by the de novo pathway, which
  takes place at the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocyte (the arrows depicted
  a cascade of the step-by-step biosynthesis). The initial reactants are two acetyl-CoA
  molecules, which merge and convert into acetoacetyl-CoA. Acetoacetyl-CoA then merges
  with another acetyl-CoA molecule to form HMG-CoA. HMG-CoA goes through a series
  of complex chemical reactions (displayed as “…”) and is eventually converted to
  cholesterol
