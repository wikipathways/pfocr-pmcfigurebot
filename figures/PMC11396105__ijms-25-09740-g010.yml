caption: Interaction network of lipid metabolism-associated pathways and key genes.
  The different colors box and circle background represented associated genes and
  pathways, respectively. The red box genes represented DNA methylation, and the hub
  genes were magnified and noted by dashed red circles. If the gene belonged to the
  pathway, the connection line color was the same as the background color of the pathway
