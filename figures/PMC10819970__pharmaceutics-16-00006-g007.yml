caption: Ma@(MnO2+FTY) for the treatment of ischemic penumbra. The nanoparticles are
  coated with macrophage membrane, which grants them inflammation-targeting chemotactic
  abilities. The presence of MnO2 nanoparticles, known for their large surface area,
  enables effective scavenging of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the
  generation of oxygen (O2) to rescue compromised neurons. This ROS consumption process
  additionally inhibits the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway in microglia, leading to a reduction
  in the proinflammatory response. FTY, housed within MnO2 nanoparticles via electrostatic
  interaction, facilitates the phenotypic transformation of microglia, ultimately
  reversing the proinflammatory microenvironment. This transition is achieved by activating
  the signal transducer and activator of the transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Reprinted
