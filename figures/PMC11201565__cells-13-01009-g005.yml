caption: Placental chemokine signaling pathway molecules during SHS or eCig treatment.
  Inflammatory mediators were determined in treated animals as compared to controls.
  Protein expression of BLC (A), eotaxin-1 (B), KC (C), 6Ckine (D), lymphotactin (E),
  and galectin (F) was differently regulated by length and type of treatment when
  compared to controls. Significant differences are noted as * p â‰¤ 0.05
