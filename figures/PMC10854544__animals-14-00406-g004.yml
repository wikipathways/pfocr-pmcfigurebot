  pathway.
caption: GSEA enrichment map of each comparison group’s proteome based on KEGG pathway.
  (A) The proteasome hallmark gene set was downregulated in the HP vs. LP muscle comparison.
  (B) The cAMP signaling pathway hallmark gene set was downregulated in the HP vs.
  MP muscle comparison. (C,D) The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and VEGF signaling pathway
  hallmark gene sets were downregulated in the MP vs. LP muscle comparison. (E) The
  Calcium signaling pathway hallmark gene set was upregulated in the MP vs. LP muscle
  comparison. The green broken line indicates the enrichment score (ES) of the protein,
  and the proteins are sorted from large to small according to FC from left to right.
  When the ES < 0, the function is enriched at the back end of the protein ranking,
  indicating low protein expression, and the function is inhibited, but activated
  vice versa. NES = normalized enrichment score; NOM p-val = nominal p value
