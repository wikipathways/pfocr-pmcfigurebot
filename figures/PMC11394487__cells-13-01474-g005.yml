figure_title: AMPK signaling pathway.
caption: AMPK signaling pathway. AMPK activates AKT, MAP2K3, MLYCD, NAD+, PCAF-SWI/SNF,
  PFKFB, PI3K, SLC2A1, SLC2A4, and Tsc1-Tsc2 and inhibits ACC, CFTR, CRTC2, ELAVL1,
  FASN, glycogen synthase, HMGCR, HNF4A, LIPE, PPAT, and TBC1D1 via the phosphorylation
  of ACC, AKT, EEF2K, EP300, glycogen synthase, MLYCD, PFKFB, and PPAT. MTOR activates
  EIF4EBP1 and RPS6KB1 and inhibits ULK1 via phosphorylation. ULK1 induces autophagy.
  EEF2 is activated upon phosphorylation by EEF2K, which induces protein elongation.
  NOS3 is activated following phosphorylation by AKT1, promoting angiogenesis
