caption: Mitogen‐activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) silencing inhibits endothelial
  cell (EC) growth. Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were cultured in the supernatant
  of human non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and transiently transfected with
  MAPK4 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (50 nM) in 24‐well plates via Lipofectamine
  3000 reagent in vitro. (a) The expression of MAPK4 in HUVECs was detected by immunofluorescence.
  (b) The number of cells was determined by cell counting. (c) Cell counting kit‐8
  (CCK‐8) assay was used to evaluate the proliferation ability of HUVECs. (d) The
  tube‐forming ability of HUVECs was evaluated by tube formation assay. (e) The expression
  of ki‐67 in HUVECS was detected by fluorescence‐activated cell sorting. (f, g) Extracellular
  regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p‐ERK1/2) in HUVECs
  was detected by western blot analysis. (h, i) The expression of p‐ERK1/2 in HUVECs
  was detected by immunofluorescence analysis and calculated. Representative data
  from three independent experiments are shown. **p < 0.01, NS, no significance.
