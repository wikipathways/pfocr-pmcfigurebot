caption: Characterization of underlying genes and regulators related to cell expansion
  and cell division. (a) The heat map shows the numbers of upregulated and downregulated
  genes related to the plant hormone at different stages during fruit development
  in ‘Sungold’ as compared with ‘F43’ based on log2 (Number + 1) values. (b) Schematic
  diagram and heat map of differences in expressions of DEGs involved in auxin signaling
  pathway during fruit development. Key enzymes expressed differently have colored
  rectangles (on the left) and genes linked to these enzymes as well as their log2
  FC values presented in the heat map (on the right). The redder color represents
  a higher log2 FC, and the bluer color represents a lower log2 FC. The yellow color
  represents the median value, and the gray color represents not available (NA). AUX1,
  auxin influx carrier; TIR1, transport inhibitor response 1; AUX/IAA, auxin-responsive
  protein IAA; ARF, auxin response factor; GH3, auxin-responsive GH3 gene family;
  SAUR, SAUR family protein. (c) The number of differentially expressed TF genes between
  the two cultivars. (d) Heat map and clustering dendrogram of differences in expressions
  of DEGs related to cell expansion and cell division. A redder color represents higher
  log2 FC, and a bluer color represents lower log2 FC. The yellow color represents
  the median value, and the gray color represents NA. The red star indicates the branch
  with the most significant differences in gene expressions
