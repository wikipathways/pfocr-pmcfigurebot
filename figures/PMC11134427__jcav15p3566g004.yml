caption: The experimental results of YQHXD in the treatment of PLGC rats. (A) HE stained
  pathological section of gastric tissue (HE *100). (B) Expression of PCNA in gastric
  mucosa of YQHXD (IHC *400). (C) mRNA expression of key genes of HIF-1α signaling
  pathway in gastric mucosa of rats. (D) Protein expression of key genes of HIF-1α
  signaling pathway in gastric mucosa of rats. (±s, n=8; Compared with normal group
  *P<0.05, **P<0.01, compared with model group ΔP<0.05, ΔΔP<0.01)
