figure_title: IDR ensemble dimensions explain responsiveness to changes in cell volume
caption: (A) Using rapid osmotic perturbation, cellular volume is reduced (top) or
  expanded (bottom), altering intracellular crowding within Page 18/18 seconds. These
  timescales ensure changes in FRET efficiency (ΔEf) reflect physical changes in the
  cellular environment, as opposed to the downstream consequences of a response pathway
  driven by phosphorylation or gene expression. (B) If macromolecular crowding were
  the only determinant of IDR dimensions, we would naively expect a decrease in cell
  volume to drive ensemble compaction (top) and an increase in cell volume to drive
  ensemble expansion (bottom). (C) Actual data for sequences 5/31/18, demonstrating
  that while some sequences respond as expected by the naive model (left), others
  show complete insensitivity (middle) while others show inverse behavior, expanding
  upon volume reduction (right). These results illustrate the complex range of sequence-dependent
  responses available to IDRs. (D) To quantitatively compare different sequences,
  we can compare basal FRET efficiency (Ef under normal conditions) with the change
  in FRET efficiency ΔEf upon increase or decrease in cellular volume. (E) Sequence
  properties (fraction of disorder-promoting residues, FCR, and kappa) are weakly
  correlated with molecular function (see also Fig. S10), here defined as the change
  in FRET efficiency upon cell volume decrease. In correlating ΔEf vs. many sequence
  parameters, Ef basal (and, to a lesser extent, ensemble dimensions from coarse-grained
  simulations) offer the strongest predictive power of molecular function (Fig. S10).
  (F) Plotting ΔEf upon the increase in cellular volume and (G) ΔEf upon the decrease
  in cellular volume reveals that the most sensitive sequences (those with the largest
  change in Ef) are strongly correlated with those that start out being more expanded
  under basal conditions
