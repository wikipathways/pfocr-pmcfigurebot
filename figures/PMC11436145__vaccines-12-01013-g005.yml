caption: Transcriptome analysis of immune response-related pathways. (A) Volcano plots
  showing the upregulated and downregulated genes in different groups under stimulation
  with different peptide pools. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that both of
  the candidate vaccines activated immune response-related pathways, especially the
  B-cell receptor signaling pathway and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathways. (C)
  Both of the candidate vaccines affected the overall immune response and inflammation-related
  pathways (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001)
