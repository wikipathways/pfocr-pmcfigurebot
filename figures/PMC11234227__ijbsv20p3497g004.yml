figure_title: scRNA-seq analysis shows down-regulation of type I IFN response pathway
  in tumor cells with high IRPI.
caption: 'scRNA-seq analysis shows down-regulation of type I IFN response pathway
  in tumor cells with high IRPI. (A) Log-normalized expression of canonical markers
  for cells in 8 clusters in the GSE176078 cohort. (B) Bubble plot of the percent
  expression of marker genes in different cell subtypes. (C) UMAP visualization of
  all cell subtypes in HER2+ BC patients with high and low IRPI. (D) Bar plots of
  the cell proportions of each HER2+ BC patients. (E) UMAP visualization of reclustered
  epithelial cells in all HER2+ BC patients. (F) The heatmap showed that cells in
  cluster 0, 5, 7 and 8 of epithelial cells had higher CNVs, which were defined as
  tumor cells. (G) The ridge plot showed the HALLMARK enrichment of DEGs between tumor
  cells in high IRPI group and low IRPI group. (H) GSEA indicated that Tumor cells,
  but not other non-tumor cells, showed down-regulation of type I IFN response pathway
  in HER2+ BC with high IRPI. scRNA-seq: single-cell RNA sequencing, UMAP: Uniform
  manifold approximation and projection, CNVs: copy number variants, DEGs: differentially
  expressed genes, GSEA: Gene set enrichment analysis'
