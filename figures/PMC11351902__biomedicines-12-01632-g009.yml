caption: 'Protein expressions involved in Bax/Bcl-2 signaling pathway in the testicular
  tissue. (A) Representative Western blots of Bax, Bcl-2, and β-actin. The relative
  protein expression levels of Bax (B), Bcl-2 (C) and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (D). Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM (n = 4). # p < 0.05 vs. Ctr; * p < 0.05 vs. CP; ns, no significance'
