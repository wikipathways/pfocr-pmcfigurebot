caption: Effect of BFNB on the expression of growth factors EGF and FGF7, and proteins
  implicated in the PI3K-AKT pathway and cell cycle. Representative Western blots
  using protein extracts from the dorsal and head skin of mice after 15 days of treatment
  are shown in the left panel. The graphs show the relative expression of each protein
  evaluated. Expression was normalized using the expression of the endogenous control,
  GAPDH. Statistical analysis was performed using the average protein expression of
  three mice per experimental group. One-way ANOVA was applied, followed by Tukey’s
  multiple comparison test. Significant differences between experimental groups are
  indicated by (*). The significance levels used were * p ≤ 0.033, ** p ≤ 0.002, and
  *** p ≤ 0.001
