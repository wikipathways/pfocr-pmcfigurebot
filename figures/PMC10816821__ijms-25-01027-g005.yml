figure_title: Effect of NAR on the APP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome signalling pathway
  in PAMs.
caption: Effect of NAR on the APP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome signalling pathway in
  PAMs. (A) Effect of NAR on the expression of critical genes of the NLRP3 inflammatory
  vesicle signalling pathway in PAMs. (B) Effect of NAR on the expression of essential
  proteins of the NLRP3 inflammasome in PAMs. (C) Effect of NAR on the expression
  of IL-18 and IL-1β proteins in PAMs. (Different lowercase letters indicate statistically
  significant differences between groups p < 0.05, while the same lowercase letters
  indicate no significant differences between groups p > 0.05)
