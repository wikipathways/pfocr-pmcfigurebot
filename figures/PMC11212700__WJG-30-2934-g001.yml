caption: 'Major Signaling pathways of mitophagy. Parkin-dependent Ubiquitinated Mitophagy
  Pathway: Following the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, PINK1 recruits
  and activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin, leading to the formation
  of ubiquitin chains. These chains then attract a series of autophagy receptors including
  P62, NDP52, and OPTN. Subsequently, these receptors bind to light chain 3 (LC3),
  facilitating the connection of the polyubiquitinated mitochondrial outer membrane
  to the autophagosome membrane, thereby mediating mitophagy. In this process, TANK-binding
  kinase 1 kinase enhances the affinity of the autophagy receptor for the Ub chain
  by phosphorylating the receptor. PTEN-L can reduce Parkin phosphorylation and inhibit
  its E3 ligase activity, thereby inhibiting mitophagy. Parkin-Independent Ubiquitinated
  Mitophagy Pathway: E3 ubiquitin ligases such as ARIH1, MUL1, and Gp78 may serve
  as compensatory pathways for Parkin-mediated mitophagy, although the precise mechanisms
  are yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, PINK1 has the ability to recruit NDP52 and
  OPTN to mitochondria, thereby directly initiating mitophagy in a Parkin-independent
  manner. Receptor-Mediated Ubiquitination-Independent Mitophagy Pathway: Proteins
  including FK506 binding protein 8, BCL2-interacting protein 3 like/NIP3-like protein
  X (BNIP3L/NIX), BNIP3, FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1), and Bcl2-L-13 directly
  bind to LC3, enabling the mitochondrial membrane to connect to the autophagosome
  membrane and mediate mitophagy. SCF-FBXL4 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation
  of BNIP3L/NIX and BNIP3, thereby inhibiting mitophagy. Under hypoxia conditions,
  phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) promotes the dephosphorylation of FUNDC1, enhancing
  FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy. Conversely, Src kinase and Casein kinase 2 phosphorylate
  FUNDC1, inhibiting its mitophagy-promoting activity. Although Bcl-xL positively
  regulates the binding of BNIP3 to LC3, it inhibits FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy by
  suppressing PGAM5. LC3: Light chain 3; BNIP3L/NIX: BCL2-interacting protein 3 like/NIP3-like
  protein X; FUNDC1: FUN14 domain containing 1; TBK1: TANK-binding kinase 1.'
