caption: Endothelial insulin signaling and the associated consequences in health (A)
  and diabetes (B). In non-diabetic/healthy individuals, insulin binds to its membrane
  receptor to preferentially activate, via the insulin receptor substrate (IRS), the
  phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway leading to the induction of endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and vascular
  smooth muscle (VSMC) dilation. In diabetes, insulin-induced activation of PI3-kinase
  and NO production is compromised whereas induction of MAP-kinase is maintained,
  leading to production of endothlin-1 (ET-1), VSMC constriction and decreased myofiber
  perfusion and hypertension. From Love et al., 2021 [54]
