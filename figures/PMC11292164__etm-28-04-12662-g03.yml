  cells.
caption: 'Interference of FZD2 blocks the Notch/NF-κB signaling pathway in U87MG cells.
  (A) U87MG cells were transfected with sh-NC or sh-FZD2 and the expression levels
  of Notch/NF-κB signaling-associated proteins were measured using western blotting.
  (B) U87MG cells were transfected with sh-FZD2 with or without treatment with the
  Notch agonist, JAG, and the expression levels of Notch/NF-κB signaling-associated
  proteins were measured using western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs sh-NC; ##P<0.01, ###P<0.001
  vs sh-FZD2. sh, short hairpin; NC, negative control; FZD2, frizzled family protein
  2; JAG, Jagged-1; p-, phosphorylated; t-, total; N1ICD, Notch 1 intracellular domain'
