  pathway of weaned piglets.
caption: The effect of proteases on intestinal inflammation and the MAPK signaling
  pathway of weaned piglets. (A–C) Proinflammatory factor mRNA expression (TNF-α,
  IL-1β, IL-6) in intestinal inflammatory factors. (D–H) Western blotting was used
  to detect the protein levels of phosphorylated ERK (P-ERK), phosphorylated JNK (P-JNK),
  phosphorylated P38 (P-P38), and phosphorylated NF-κB (P-NF-κB). All data are shown
  as means ± SEM (n = 6, 5 replicates). *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01
