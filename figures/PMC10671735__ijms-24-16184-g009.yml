caption: 'The expression of stress-related genes and chlorophyll-related genes of
  Col-0 and DgIAA21 OE1 line under 20% PEG 6000 treatment. (A) The heatmap of expression
  levels of 13 stress-related genes after 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h under
  drought stress. (B) The changes in the expression level of chlorophyll degradation
  pathway genes (C) and chlorophyll synthesis pathway genes (C) after 0 h and 24 h
  under drought stress. Error bars represent mean standard deviation (SD). Asterisks
  (*) represent significant differences compared with the Col-0 plants at the same
  time. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, ns: non-significant'
