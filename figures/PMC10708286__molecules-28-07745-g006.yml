figure_title: (A–C) KEGG enrichment analysis.
caption: (A–C) KEGG enrichment analysis. The horizontal coordinate represents the
  pathway name, and the vertical coordinate represents the enrichment rate, which
  represents the ratio of the metabolite number enriched in this pathway to the background
  number annotated in the pathway. The larger the ratio, the greater the degree of
  enrichment. The column color gradient indicates the significance of enrichment.
  The darker the default color, the more significantly enriched the KEGG term, where
  the p-value or FDR < 0.001 is marked ***, the p-value or FDR < 0.01 is marked **,
  and the p-value or FDR < 0.05 is marked *. (D–F) KEGG pathway differential-abundance-score
  maps. The horizontal coordinate represents the DA score and the vertical coordinate
  represents the KEGG metabolic pathway name. DA score reflects the overall change
  in all metabolites in the metabolic pathway. A score of 1 indicates that the expression
  trend of all annotated differential metabolites in the pathway is upregulated; −1
  indicates that the expression trend of all annotated differential metabolites in
  the pathway is downregulated; and the length of the line segment indicates the absolute
  value of DA score. The size of the dot indicates the number of differential metabolites
  annotated in the pathway, and the larger the dot, the more differential metabolites
  in the pathway. The dot distribution on the right side of the central axis and the
  longer line segment indicate that the overall expression of the pathway tends to
  be upregulated. The dots are distributed to the left of the central axis, and the
  longer the line segment, the more inclined the overall expression of the pathway
  is to downregulate. (A,D) CM vs. CC. (B,E) CS vs. CC. (C,F) CS vs. CM
