figure_title: The biosynthesis process of CLA in ruminants (cattle).
caption: 'The biosynthesis process of CLA in ruminants (cattle). The biosynthesis
  of CLA in ruminant milk involves two primary pathways: endosynthesis and biohydrogenation.
  In the rumen, lipids undergo initial hydrolysis into LA and LNA, which are subsequently
  transformed through isomerization and hydrogenation into TVA by the isomerase enzyme
  secreted by group A bacteria, and stearic acid by group B bacteria. Notably, the
  products of isomerization differ between the two. Unlike biohydrogenation, the cis-9,
  trans-11 CLA formed in the rumen is subject to partial absorption or metabolic transformation
  by rumen microorganisms, resulting in the formation of TVA. The synthesis of cis-9,
  trans-11 CLA is heavily reliant on Î”9-Desaturase, which participates in the final
  step of endogenous synthesis of CLA via breast TVA'
