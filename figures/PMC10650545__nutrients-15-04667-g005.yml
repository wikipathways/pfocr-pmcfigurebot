caption: Gene Ontology (GO) and metabolic pathway analysis show differences in endocytosis
  and other pathways between the groups. Genes related to Gene Ontology (GO) endocytosis,
  metabolic processes, and xenobiotic metabolic process were assessed. (A) The Gene
  Ontology (GO:006897) pathway related to endocytosis is shown among the groups colored
  by z-score and grouped according to a cladogram. (B) Heatmap showing expression
  (z-score) of genes per group clustered by cladogram in the metabolic process (GO:0008152)
  pathway. (C) Heatmap showing expression (z-score) of genes per group clustered by
  cladogram in the xenobiotic metabolic process (GO:0006805) pathway
