figure_title: Comprehensive metabolic pathway analysis.
caption: Comprehensive metabolic pathway analysis. (A) Bar plot presenting the top
  25 enriched pathways of metabolites from metabolite set enrichment analysis. (B)
  Scatter plot representing the overall enrichment of metabolic pathways from metabolomic
  pathway analysis. (C) DA-Score plot showcasing the top 30 pathways with significant
  enrichment of differential metabolites from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  analysis. DA-Score, Differential Abundance Score. A score of 1 indicates up-regulation
  across all identified metabolites in the pathway, while-1 indicates down-regulation
