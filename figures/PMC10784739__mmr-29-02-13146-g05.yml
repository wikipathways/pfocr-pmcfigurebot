figure_title: TIFA facilitates the osteoclast differentiation induced by RANKL via
  the NF-κB pathway.
caption: TIFA facilitates the osteoclast differentiation induced by RANKL via the
  NF-κB pathway. (A) The expression of NF-κB p65 in nucleus and cytoplasm was examined
  by western blotting. (B) The location of NF-κB p65 was detected by immunofluorescence.
  Scale bar, 50 µm. Data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation, **P<0.01.
  TIFA, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-interacting protein with
  forkhead-associated domain; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; sh, short
  hairpin
article_title: TIFA contributes to periodontitis in diabetic mice via activating the
  NF‑κB signaling pathway
