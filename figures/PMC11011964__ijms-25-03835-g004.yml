caption: 'An overview of signal pathways for producing AMPs in insects. The model
  is mainly based on the immune pathways of Drosophila. NF-κB pathways are activated
  upon binding with bacteria and fungi cell wall components by recognition modules.
  (a) In the Toll pathway, cell surface recognition molecules PGRP-SA, PGRP-SD, and
  GNBP1 target Lys-type PGN of Gram-positive bacteria, and GNBP3 recognizes β-glucan
  of yeast and entomopathogenic fungi to activate Toll signaling. Contrary to common
  belief, MsPGRPs (from M. sexta) bind to DAP-type PGN of Gram-negative bacteria to
  activate the Toll pathway. Toll9 from B. mori acts as a pattern recognition receptor
  and directly binds lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to initiate the Toll pathway without
  Spätzle binding. Eventually, transcription factor Dorsal and/or Dif translocate
  into the nucleus to induce the expression of AMP genes (bomanin, drosomycin, and
  metchnikowin). (b) In the IMD pathway, pathogen recognition receptors PGRP-LC and
  PGRP-LE recognize DAP-type PGN of Gram-negative bacteria and some Gram-positive
  bacteria. These recognition receptors recruit the IMD adaptor to finally activate
  the transactivator Rel, and Rel translocates into the nucleus to initiate transcription
  of specific AMP genes (attacin, cecropin, defensin, diptericin, drosocin, and drosomycin).
  (c) In the JAK-STAT pathway, damage signals/septic injury or pathogens induce Unpaired
  (Upd) expression, and the pathway is activated through binding of Upd to Dome. STAT,
  which is phosphorylated by JAK, then separates from Dome, dimerizes and enters into
  the nucleus to induce AMP transcription (drosomycin). Additionally, AMPs can be
  regulated by other signaling pathways, including insulin-like signaling, ecdysone
  signaling, NO signaling, and the JNK pathway. In brief, (d) starvation stress triggers
  FOXO activation by insulin-like signaling, and FOXO translocates into the nucleus,
  initiating the expression of AMPs without microbe challenge. (e) Gram-negative bacteria
  activate NO signaling (NOS oxidizes Arginine to generate NO) in hemocytes, and the
  released X-factor triggers AMP production by IMD pathways in Drosophila. The JNK
  pathway consists of TAK1, Hep, JNK, Jun/Fox, and transcription factors FOXO and
  AP-1. Appropriate activation of JNK signaling, which shares a kinase dTAK1 with
  the IMD pathway, contributes to AMP production. Ecdysone signaling also regulates
  AMP production by the IMD pathway in Drosophila. Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)
  promotes the synthesis of ecdysone. Active 20E binds to nuclear receptor EcR/USP,
  initiating the expression of a series of transcription factors. Subsequently, transcription
  factors up-regulate PGRP-LC expression to activate the IMD pathway or directly initiate
  AMP expression by the IMD pathway. E: Ecdysone. Dashed arrows indicate that the
  path is deduced.'
