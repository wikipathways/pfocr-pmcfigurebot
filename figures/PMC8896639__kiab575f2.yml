caption: Dose- and time-dependent response of expression of OsLsi1 and OsBOR1 to different
  B concentrations in rice roots. A–C, Dose–response of OsLsi1 (A), OsBOR1 (B), and
  OsNIP3;1 (C) expression in the roots. D–F, Time-dependent expression of OsLsi1 (D),
  OsBOR1 (E), and OsNIP3;1 (F) in the roots in response to high B. For dose–response
  experiment, seedlings (21-d-old) were exposed to a solution containing 0, 0.3, 3,
  or 30 µM B for 7 d (A–C). For time-course experiment, seedlings (25-d-old) precultured
  in B-free solution for 3 d were exposed to 30 µM B for different times indicated
  (D–F). OsNIP3;1 was used as a B-responsive marker gene (C and F). The expression
  level was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Histone H3 was used as an internal
  standard. Expression relative to the roots (−B) is shown. Data are means ± sd (n = 4).
  Different lowercase letters indicate significant difference at P < 0.01 by Tukey–Kramer’s
  test.
