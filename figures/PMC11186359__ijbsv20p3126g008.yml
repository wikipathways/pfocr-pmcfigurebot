caption: A schematic diagram showing how PM increases AREG-dependent glutamine metabolism
  and lung cancer proliferation. Long-term exposure to PM leads to increased AREG
  expression, which in turn induces SLC1A5 expression through the EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway. The upregulation of SLC1A5 facilitates the accumulation of glutamine-derived
  TCA cycle metabolites, thereby promoting lung cancer cell growth and proliferation
