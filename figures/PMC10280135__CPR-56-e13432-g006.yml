caption: Involvement of the STAG1–HIF1α signalling pathway in the angiogenic role
  of circRNA‐007371. (A, B) The protein level of STAG1 in murine livers was analysed
  by immunohistochemical staining in the thioacetamide (TAA)‐ (A) or carbon tetrachloride
  (CCl4)‐induced murine fibrotic models (B). (C–E) EOMA endothelial cells transfected
  with the empty plasmid or circRNA‐007371 overexpressing plasmid. The mRNA level
  of Stag1 in EOMA cells was determined by qPCR (C). The protein levels of STAG1,
  HIF1α, and CENPE were determined by Western blot (D). Colocalization of Ki67/STAG1,
  HIF1α/STAG1, and CENPE/STAG1 in EOMA cells was determined by immunofluorescence
  (E), n = 3/group. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
