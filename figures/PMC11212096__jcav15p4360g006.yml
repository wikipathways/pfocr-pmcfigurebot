caption: Functional inference of MYBL2 in PAAD. (A) Volcano plot analysis identifies
  DEGs. Red dots represent 139 upregulated genes; blue dots represent 87; grey dots
  indicate not significant. DEGs with the criteria set of |log2FC| > 1, adjusted p
  < 0.05. (B) Differential gene expression heat map with different colors representing
  trends in gene expression in pancreatic cancer tissues. (C) GO term enrichment results
  for differentially up-regulated genes. (D) Differential up-regulation of genes KEGG
  pathway enrichment results. Colors represent the significance of differential enrichment,
  the size of the circles represents the number of genes, the larger the circle, the
  greater the number of genes.
