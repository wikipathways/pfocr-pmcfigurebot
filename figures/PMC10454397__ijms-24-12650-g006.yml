figure_title: Overexpression of BmJHBPd2 results in the inhibition of JH signaling
  pathway in silk glands assayed by qRT-PCR.
caption: 'Overexpression of BmJHBPd2 results in the inhibition of JH signaling pathway
  in silk glands assayed by qRT-PCR. The following JH signaling pathway–related genes
  were selected: Kr-h1 (A), Met1 (B), Met2 (C), and SRC (D). BmRpl3 was used as a
  control. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.
  * p < 0.05; ** p <0.01; *** p < 0.001'
