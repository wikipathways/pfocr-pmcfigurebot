caption: BW18 inactivated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in HEL cells. (A) Venn diagram
  identified JAK2 as the target gene of BW18 in AML by intersecting the predicted
  targets of BW18 with the targets of AML from different databases. (B) AutoDockTools-1.5.6
  was used to predict the molecular docking models of BW18 with JAK2. (C) CETSA was
  performed to test the interactions of BW18 and JAK2. (D) The graph showed the quantification
  of JAK2 protein versus temperature points based on Western blot analyses. (E) HEL
  cells were treated with BW18 at the indicated doses for 24 h. The expression levels
  of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3 and STAT3 were analyzed by Western blot. (F) Densitometry
  analysis of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3 and STAT3. All data are expressed as the mean
  ± SD. β-actin was used as the loading control. Each experiment was repeated in triplicate.
