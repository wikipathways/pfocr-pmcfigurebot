caption: a, Experimental design for bulk RNA sequencing b-c, Liver bulk RNA-seq data
  represented as heatmap for genes related to ISR and OSR that are specifically upregulated
  in KO No Cys (AA, amino acids) (b), cholesterol and lipid synthesis and degradation
  (c) d-e, Heat map of genes that are specifically up- or down-regulated in epididymal
  adipose tissue in KO No Cys mice, including genes related to, lipid, thiol, and
  small molecule metabolism (d), and extracellular organization, biosynthetic pathways
  in small molecules, AA, fatty acids and sterols (e)
