caption: Synthetic lethality occurs when a defect in the homologous recombination
  repair (HRR) pathway is combined with inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
  (PARP). (i) PARP binds to sites of single strand breaks (SSBs), PARylates substrates
  and recruits DNA repair proteins. (ii) PARP inhibitors (PARPis) bind PARP, preventing
  PARylation and blocking access of PARP to DNA lesions that results in double strand
  breaks (DSBs). (iii) PARPis can also work to trap PARP at the DNA, inhibiting the
  dissociation of PARP from DNA and leading to the generation of DSBs. In cells with
  defective HRR, DSBs are unable to be repaired, leading to cell death. Created with
