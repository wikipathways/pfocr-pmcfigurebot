figure_title: Wound-induced foliar gene expression.
caption: Wound-induced foliar gene expression. Four-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana
  wildtype (WT) or lox2 plants were wounded with a hole punch on each fully expanded
  rosette leaf and harvested at 1 and 12 h. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) and
  ridgeline plots of WT (1 h) (A,E), WT (12 h) (B,F), lox2 (1 h) (C,G) and lox2 (12
  h) (D,H). Wound-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined by
  DESeq2 (p-value (padj) ≤ 0.05 and log2 fold change ≥2 or ≤−2). The ridgeline plot
  visualizes the distribution of differential enrichment categories identified by
  GSEA. Significantly differentially expressed pathways in ridgeline plots are indicated
  in green
