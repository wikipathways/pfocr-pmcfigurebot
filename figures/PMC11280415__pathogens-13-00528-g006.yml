caption: Identification of top canonical pathways activated by SARS-CoV-2-infected
  brains. Network maps show the pathways regulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. At 6 days
  post-infection, the gene expression related to (A) PRR signaling merged with the
  neuroinflammation signaling pathway, while (B) pyroptosis and necroptosis are represented
  using the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) tool
