caption: The alteration in the pattern of (A) TNF-α expression and (B) p65 subunit
  of NF-κB signalling pathway in the serum where the concentration of TNF-α was found
  to be downregulated in the 500 mg/kg BW group significantly (p < 0.001). The values
  are represented in ±SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001. The results
  were calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test
