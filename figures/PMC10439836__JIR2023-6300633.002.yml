figure_title: The scRNA profiles for T cells in Ctrl and RA samples.
caption: The scRNA profiles for T cells in Ctrl and RA samples. (a) UMAP clustering
  distribution of T cells. Each dot represents one cell. From left to right, each
  color represents cell type and sample type. (b) Violin plot showing the expression
  of major marker genes. (c) Statistical and differential change analysis of T-cell
  proportions in the Ctrl and RA samples (statistical analysis performed as above).
  (d) Differential expression analysis of T-cell subpopulations. (e, f) GSEA shows
  enrichment pathways in T cell subpopulations. ES, enrichment score; NES, normalized
  enrichment score
