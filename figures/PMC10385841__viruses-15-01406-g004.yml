caption: (A) Rotavirus interactions with the host innate immune system. RV is recognized
  by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (IRIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5 (MDA-5) receptors, followed by activation of the transcription factors IRF3
  and NF-kB through signaling facilitated by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein
  (MAVS). The activated interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-kB) modulate the expression of types I and III interferons
  (IFNs) stimulating the synthesis of IFN stimulatory genes. Activation of the NF-κB
  pathway by PRRs results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
  IFNs are then released and bind to their respective receptors leading to activation
  of signal transducer and of transcription (STAT)-1, STAT-2, and IRF9 and further
  promoting IFN production creating an “antiviral state”. (B) DEGs associated with
  IFN signaling modulated in response to PIE infection with G9P[13] and G5P[7]. Bars
  indicate the fold-change difference between infected PIEs and uninfected control.
