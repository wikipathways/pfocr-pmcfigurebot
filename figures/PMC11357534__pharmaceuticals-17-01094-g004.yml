figure_title: Effects of 5-fluorouracil with or without thymol on the p-AKT/p-GSK3α,3β
  signaling pathway in liver tissue of rats.
caption: 'Effects of 5-fluorouracil with or without thymol on the p-AKT/p-GSK3α,3β
  signaling pathway in liver tissue of rats. (I) Representative immunoblot of protein
  levels of AKT, p-AKT, GSK3α,3β, and p-GSK3α,3β (the upper band for α and the lower
  band for β) in liver tissues. Proteins were immunoblotted with Akt antibody in “the
  first upper panel,” p-Akt antibody in “the second panel,” GSK3α,3β antibody in “the
  third panel,” p-GSK3α,3β antibody in “the fourth panel,” and after stripping with
  GAPDH antibody as a loading control in the “lower panel.” (II) Quantitative results
  for the immunoblot, showing (a) the ratio of p-Akt/Akt and (b) the ratio of p-GSK3α,3β/GSK3α,3β
  protein levels expressed, and the relative quantities were normalized to the control
  and expressed as a fold of induction. The densities of immunoblots were quantified
  using analysis software. Values are mean ± SEM (n = 3). x, y, or z: The 5-fluorouracil
  and Fu+ thymol (60 mg/kg) groups are significantly different at p < 0.05. p ≤ 0.05
  was evaluated using ANOVA followed by Tukey–Kramer as a post-hoc test. 5-FU: 5-fluorouracil;
  Akt: protein Kinase B; p-Akt: phosphorylated Akt, GSK3α,3β: glycogen synthase kinase
  3 α and 3β; p-GSK3α,3β: phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 α and 3β'
