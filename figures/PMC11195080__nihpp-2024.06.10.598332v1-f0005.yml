caption: (a) GFP reporter plasmid introduced into E. coli K-12 MG1655 WT, Δcrp, and
  ΔcyaA cells to monitor SQR gene activity. Flow cytometry was used to detect activity
  at early (t=5h) and late (t=24h) stationary phases. The panel on the left represents
  a biological replicate, and the results are consistent across all 3 replicates,
  as demonstrated in the panel on the right. Statistical significance observed between
  control and mutant groups (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, 2-tailed t-test).
  (b) Redox activities of E. coli K-12 MG1655 WT, Δcrp, and ΔcyaA cells were measured
  at early (t=5h) and late (t=24h) stationary phases by flow cytometry using a RSG
  dye. This dye fluoresces green after reduction by bacterial reductases. A representative
  biological replicate is shown (left), with consistent results across all 5 replicates
  (right). Statistical significance observed between control and mutant groups (*P
  < 0.05, **P < 0.01, 2-tailed t-test). (c) E. coli cells with integrated mCherry
  expression system used to validate cellular respiration. Cells were diluted into
  fresh media and treated with ampicillin (200 μg/mL) for 20 hours. Flow cytometry
  measured the red fluorescence of intact surviving cells. A representative biological
  replicate is shown, with consistent results across all 3 replicates. (d) RSG levels
  of cells (carrying the mCherry expression system) at exponential phase (t=3h); cells
  before ampicillin treatment; non-lysed (intact) cells after 20 hours of ampicillin
  treatment; and untreated cells after 20 hours of culturing. A representative biological
  replicate is shown (left), with consistent results across all 4 replicates (right).
  Statistical significance observed between intact antibiotic-treated cells and others
  (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, 2-tailed t-test). (e) High throughput screening of mutants
  from Keio collection. The mutant strains selected are associated with central metabolism.
  Stationary phase cells were diluted 100-fold in fresh medium and treated with ampicillin
  (200 μg/mL) or ofloxacin (5 μg/mL) for 20 hours. Treated cultures were washed, serially
  diluted, and plated on agar plates to quantify CFUs. (f) Genes related to the TCA
  cycle, ETC, ATP synthase, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were knocked
  out and then treated with ampicillin (200 μg/mL) or ofloxacin (5 μg/mL) to enumerate
  CFUs. n=4. Biphasic kill curves were generated using a non-linear model. Statistical
  significance tests were conducted using F-statistics (*P < 0.05, and **P < 0.01).
  Each data point represents the mean value ± standard deviation.
