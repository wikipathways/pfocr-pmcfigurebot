caption: scPHD2 promoted the degradation of scHIF-1α and its degradation pathway.
  (A,B) After overexpressing Flag-scHIF-1α/Myc-scPHD2 or Flag-scHIF-1α/Myc-tag in
  MFF-1 cells, treatment with CHX at different time points showed that scPHD2 accelerated
  scHIF-1α degradation. β-Actin served as an internal reference. (C,D) After overexpressing
  Flag-scHIF-1α/Myc-scPHD2 or Flag-scHIF-1α/Myc-tag in MFF-1 cells, treatment with
  CHX and MG132 at different time points showed that the effect of scPHD2 on scHIF-1α
  could be blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. β-Actin served as an internal
  reference. (E,F) At 6 h post-treatment with CHX or CHX + MG132, the degradation
  effect on scHIF-1α protein level decreased with decreased concentration of transiently
  transfected scPHD2. β-actin served as an internal reference
