caption: 'SHCBP1 promotes B16 cell proliferation through ERK phosphorylation, NC:
  control group; siSHCBP1: Lower the SHCBP1 group. Control: no-load group; OE: Overexpression
  group. (A,B) Expression of cell proliferation-related proteins was detected. * p
  < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, n = 3. (C) Heat map analysis of differential genes (>Log2 =
  1) in MAPK signaling pathway. (D) The expression levels of MAPK signaling pathway-related
  genes were detected by RT-qPCR. (E,F) Expression of ERK pathway-related proteins
  was detected. ** p < 0.01, n = 3'
