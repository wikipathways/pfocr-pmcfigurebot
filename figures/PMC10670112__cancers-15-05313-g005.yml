caption: Identification of IL-6/STAT3 signaling associated with LOC339059. (A,B) Heat
  and volcano maps of differentially expressed genes (DEGs, differences greater than
  or equal to 2.0-fold compared with the control group) after overexpression of LOC339059.
  (C) KEGG analysis of enrichment signaling pathways of DEGs associated with LOC339059.
  (D) QRT-PCR detection of the expression levels of cytokines, including interleukin
  family genes and TNF-a. (E) The levels of proteins in the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway
  were suppressed by LOC339059, according to Western blot detection. (F) IL-6 secretion
  in the cell culture supernatant was inhibited by LOC339059, according to ELISA.
  (G) The correlation between IL-6 and LOC339059. (H) Linear correlation analysis
  indicated that IL-6 expression was correlated with the expression of immune molecules
  (PDL1, M2 macrophages, and T cells). Values in the histogram represent the mean
  Â± SD. *** p < 0.001. The uncropped bolts are shown in Supplementary Materials
