caption: Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K signalling reverses VIC phenotype and
  reduces ECM protein expression in canine aVICs. aVICs were exposed to DMSO (Control),
  LY294002 (60 μM), copanlisib (5 μM) and alpelisib (50 μM) treatment for 3 days.
  (A, B) Representative confocal images of α‐SMA (red) staining in canine aVICs and
  quantitative analysis of the percentage of α‐SMA positive cells, scale bar 20 μm
  (n = 12 microscopic fields/treatment). (C) Quantitative RT‐PCR for α‐SMA, SM22 and
  Smemb mRNA expression in aVICs (n = 6) at Day 3. (D, E) Representative western blot
  of ECM and VIC phenotype protein expression and quantification of the relative protein
  expression (n = 6). (F, G) Representative western blot of PI3K 110α, AKT, phosphorylated
  AKT (p‐AKT), mTOR, phosphorylated mTOR (p‐mTOR), p70 S6K, phosphorylated p70 S6K
  (p‐p70 S6K) protein expression and quantification of the relative protein expression
  (n = 6). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA followed by Tukey's range test.
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to control. ANOVA, analysis of variance;
  ECM, extracellular matrix; VIC, valve interstitial cell.

  and secretory phenotype of valvular interstitial cells through the modulation of
  cellular senescence in a naturally occurring in vitro canine model of myxomatous
  mitral valve disease.
