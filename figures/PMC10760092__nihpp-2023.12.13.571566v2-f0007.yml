caption: '(A) Cell confluency of PANC1 and UM5 control and ROR2 knockout cells using
  two different guide RNAs (ROR2 KO #1, ROR2 KO #2) was measured every 2 hours over
  a period of 6 days (n=4). Each data point was calculated as relative cell confluency
  in relation to the first measurement. Statistical significance was determined for
  the last measurement. (B) Cell confluency of control and ROR2-overexpressing HPAF-II
  and UM32 cells was monitored for a total of 6 days. (C) Representative immunoblot
  analysis for ROR2 and indicated signaling proteins in PANC1 and UM5 control and
  ROR2 knockout cells. GAPDH served as loading control. (D) Representative immunoblot
  analysis showing expression levels and phosphorylation status of indicated signaling
  pathway regulators in control and ROR2-overexpressing HPAF-II and UM32 cells. GAPDH
  served as loading control. (E) Control and ROR2-overexpressing HPAF-II and UM32
  cells were treated with increasing concentrations of KrasG12D inhibitor MRTX1133
  and dose-response curves were established (n=3). IC50 was calculated. (F) Dose-response
  curves after treating control and ROR2-overexpressing HPAF-II and UM32 cells with
  indicated concentrations of AKT inhibitor MK-2206 (n=3). For each cell line, IC50
  was determined. Unless stated otherwise, all data are presented as mean ± SEM; p-values
  were calculated by two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001'
