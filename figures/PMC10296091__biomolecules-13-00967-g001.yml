caption: Schematic representation of A2AR effects in microglia, astrocytes, and synapses
  under physiological conditions. In astrocytes, it regulates the release and uptake
  of glutamate, and calcium efflux, while in microglia it increases pro-inflammatory
  cytokine secretion and proliferation. In the post-synaptic neurons, the A2AR increases
  synaptic plasticity and LTP through the modulation of glutamate NMDA and AMPA receptors
  and triggers the BDNF signaling pathway thus increasing neuronal survival. The short
  arrows with different directions indicate ↑(increase), ↓(decrease). Dashed line
  indicate a signal with minor strenght versus the solid line
