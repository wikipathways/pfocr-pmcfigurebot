caption: 'mTOR- and PI3K/AKT-related protein expression levels in N3a-treated cHL,
  MCL and ALK+ ALCL cells: (A): Venn diagrams and color-coded bar-plot images are
  generated as in Figure 4. Bar-plot images highlight the differential mRNA/protein
  levels for the mTOR-related- and PI3K/AKT-related- genes that are deregulated in
  both omics analyses, in each lymphoma cell line of our study (red: up-regulation;
  green: down-regulation). (B): Key mTOR pathway-proteins showed decreased or non-regulated
  expression levels. Proteomic results were validated using Western blot in cHL, MCL,
  and ALK+ ALCL cells +/−N3a. Stabilization and activation of wt p53 suppressed mTOR
  signaling in HL, MCL, and ALK+ ALCL cells. β-Actin protein expression was used as
  loading control. The calculated intensity and ratio of each band after the densitometry
  analysis are available in Table S13'
