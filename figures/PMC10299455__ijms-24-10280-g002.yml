caption: The NOTCH signaling pathway, ligands, and inhibitors. After binding to a
  cellular ligand, the NOTCH receptor is cleaved by a gamma secretase, allowing the
  nuclear translocation of the NICD, a process known as transactivation. Following
  nuclear translocation, the NICD induces the transcription of NOTCH target genes
  through its interaction with the DNA-binding partner RBPJ. NOTCH inhibitors tested
  in MCL are depicted in red. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 5 June 2023
