figure_title: Panx1 promotes carbon source uptake and leads to maintenance of lipid
  rafts in activated CD8+ T cells
caption: (a) Levels (arbitrary units – AU) of pyruvate, malate, aspartate, and citrate
  in the intracellular lysates of effector-like WT (CD4-Cre) or Panx1-KO (CD4-Cre
  Panx1fl/fl) CD8+ T cells from untargeted metabolomics are shown. (b-c) CD4-Cre and
  CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) for
  72h; in the last 12h, either 13C-Glucose (b) or 13C-Lactate (c) were substituted
  into the cultures for metabolite carbon tracing. (b) Percentages of 13C-Glucose
  incorporation into citrate, isocitrate, a-ketoglutarate, and alanine. (c) Percentages
  of 13C-Lactate incorporation into citrate and isocitrate. (d) Top enriched intracellular
  pathways in WT effector-like CD8+ T cells (compared to Panx1-KO), depicted from
  the untargeted metabolomics from (a). (e) Levels (AU) of total PIs in CD4-Cre versus
  CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl effector-like CD8+ T cells; polyunsaturated (2 or more double
  bonds) or saturated (1 or less double bonds) PIs are depicted in white and grey,
  respectively. In the right, levels (AU) of PIP(34:1) in CD4-Cre versus CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl
  effector-like CD8+ T cells. (f) CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were
  activated in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) in the presence or not of Sodium Lactate.
  Representative histograms (left) and average gMFI values (right) for Cholera Toxin
  B are shown. (g) CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro
  (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) in the presence or not of BSA-conjugated Oleic Acid. Average
  percentages of IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells are shown. (h) CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl
  CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) in the presence or not
  of Sodium Lactate and/or the CDIPT inhibitor Inostamycin (CDIPTi). Average percentages
  of IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells are shown. (i) RNA expression levels (AU) of the indicated
  PLCγ-MAPK signaling pathway genes in CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells
  after 72h of activation. (j) CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated
  in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) in the presence or not of Sodium Lactate. Representative
  histograms (left) and average gMFI values (right) for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2)
  are shown. (k) CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro
  (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) in the presence or not of Sodium Lactate. Average gMFI values
  for Glut1 are shown. (l-m) CD4-Cre and CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated
  in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) in the presence or not of additional Glucose. (l)
  Average percentages of IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells are shown. (m) ECAR kinetics, OCR kinetics,
  baseline ECAR and SRC OCR values are respectively shown. (a-e, i) Data from 2–3
  biological replicates per experimental group (from n=3 mice per group). (f-h, j-m)
  Data from 2–3 independent experiments, n=4–7 per experimental group. ns – not significant
  (p>0.05), *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001, Unpaired t-test (a, e, i),
  One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test (f-h, j-m)
