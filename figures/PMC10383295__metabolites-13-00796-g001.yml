figure_title: Mechanisms of ROS generation in cancer cells.
caption: 'Mechanisms of ROS generation in cancer cells. Both exogenous stimuli and
  endogenous factors can induce the generation of ROS, which are mainly generated
  from mitochondria, NOX, endoplasmic reticulum, energy metabolism, and other pathways.
