figure_title: Excision repair pathways of DNA single-strand breaks.
caption: Excision repair pathways of DNA single-strand breaks. Three types of excision
  repair pathways exist to remove damaged single-strand DNA and re-synthesize a new
  DNA strand, using the undamaged complementary strand as a template. (a) Base excision
  repair (BER) is responsible for the removal of non-bulky DNA lesions due to oxidation,
  alkylation, or glycosylation. Damage is recognized by a DNA glycosylase, such as
  OGG1. The damaged portion is then resected by APEX1/2 enzymes to undergo new DNA
  synthesis. (b) Nucleotide excision repair (NER) occurs in the presence of bulky
  lesions to remove a string of nucleotides. After damaged DNA or helix distortion
  is recognized and verified by XPC, a transcription initiation and repair factor
  complex composed of ERCC1, ERCC3, ERCC4, and XRCC1 proteins is recruited, and new
  DNA is added by replication protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication
  factor C (RFC), DNA polymerases, and DNA ligase 1 or XRCC1–DNA ligase 3. (c) Mismatch
  repair is activated when an incorrect Watson–Crick base pairing (outside the typical
  A to T and G to C) occurs. Mutation recognition of errors is performed by heterodimers
  MSH2-MSH6 or MSH2-MSH3, followed by termination of mismatch-provoked excision by
  heterodimers MLH1-PMS2 or MLH1-MLH3, full excision by EXO1, and replacement with
  the correct base pairing
