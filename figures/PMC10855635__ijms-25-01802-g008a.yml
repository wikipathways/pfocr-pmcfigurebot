caption: qRT-PCR analysis of differentially expressed genes in the transformed empty-vector
  control (CK) and GmAGL82-overexpressing (OX) (A) roots and (B) nodules. All data
  are shown as the means and standard errors of three replicates. * indicates a significant
  difference compared to the CK (Student’s t-test, p < 0.05). ** indicates a significant
  difference compared to the CK (Student’s t-test, p < 0.01). ALT, alpha-trehalose-phosphate
  synthase; bZIP, BZIP transcription factor; ENOD, hypothetical protein GLYMA; ETR,
  ethylene-responsive transcription factor; FRU, fructose-1; GDSL, GDSL esterase;
  HSP17, heat shock protein 17; MADS, MADS-box protein; MYB, MYB transcription factor;
  NAC181, transcriptional factor NAC11; Nodulin, early nodulin; NSP, nodulation signaling
  pathway protein 1; PAP, hypothetical protein GLYMA; PHase, phospholipase; PHR, protein
  phosphate starvation response; PIN, PIN auxin efflux transporter family protein;
  PT, inorganic phosphate transporter; SPX, SPX-domain-containing protein; WRKY, WRKY
  transcription factor
