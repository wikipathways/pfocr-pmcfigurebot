figure_title: Dose-dependent effects of co-treatment of HTGT and EMIQ on mitochondrial
  activity and PKA signaling pathway in HFD-fed mice.
caption: Dose-dependent effects of co-treatment of HTGT and EMIQ on mitochondrial
  activity and PKA signaling pathway in HFD-fed mice. (A–D) Immunoblot of proteins
  involved in mitochondrial activity and PKA signaling pathway in BAT (A,B) and iWAT
  (C,D); (E,F) The quantitative data of protein expression in BAT (E) and iWAT (F).
  Statistical significance was assessed using the Kruskal–Wallis test. The data are
  presented as means ± SEM. n = 6. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001
