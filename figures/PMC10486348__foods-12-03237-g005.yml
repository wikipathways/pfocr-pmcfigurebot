figure_title: Spearman correlation analysis of DEGs and small peptides in the pathway
  linked to amino acid synthesis and metabolism and the regulatory mechanism of compound
  metabolism.
caption: 'Spearman correlation analysis of DEGs and small peptides in the pathway
  linked to amino acid synthesis and metabolism and the regulatory mechanism of compound
  metabolism. (a,b) Spearman correlation analysis of up- and downregulated DEGs and
  small peptides. (c) The regulation mechanism diagram of KEGG pathway enriched DEGs
  combined with phenotypic data and differential metabolites. Genes are indicated
  by rectangles (|log2 (fold change)| > log21, padj < 0.05), red and blue colors denote
  upregulated and downregulated genes, correspondingly. The yellow rectangle denotes
  the pathway, and the circle with * represents the differential metabolite (VIP >
  1, |log2 (fold change)| > 2, padj < 0.05). The yellow circle represents upregulation,
  green represents downregulation, the alternating yellow and green represents both
  up- and downregulation of such substances, the gray represents no detection, and
  the asterisk indicates significant differences; the dotted line represents an indirect
  reaction, while the solid line does not necessarily represent a direct reaction,
  but may also represent reaction conditions and directions. Abbreviations: SAM-e:
  s adenosylmethionine, BA: bile acid, TC: cholesterol, HDL: high-density lipoprotein,
  EMP: glycolysis, PA: phosphatic acid, FA: fatty acid, TAG: triglyceride, LPA: lysophosphatidic
  acid, LPG: lysophosphatidylcholine, LPE: lysophosphatidylethanolamine, TAG: triglyceride,
  DAGS: diacylglycerol, MAG: monoglyceride, GL: glycerol, G3P: 3, glycerol phosphate,
  P3G: triglyceride triphosphate, DHA: dihydroxyacetone phosphate, DF6P: 6, fructose
  phosphate, Î±-KGA: Î±-Ketoglutarate, E363: succinic acid, E297: fumaric acid, OAA:
  oxaloacetic acid, CA: citric acid EMP: glycolysis, PPP: pentose phosphate pathway,
  PC: phosphatidylcholine, PE: phosphatidylethanolamine'
