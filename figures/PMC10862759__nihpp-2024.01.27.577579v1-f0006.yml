  VEN treatment:'
caption: 'A) uMAPs of cells colored by treatment time point (left), cell-type (mid)
  and VRS definition projected onto myeloid cells (right). B) Fraction of cell-types
  in each VRS. C) Fraction of VRS in pre and post treatment cells. D) Boxplot comparing
  proliferation index between VR_C1 and VR_C2 like cells pre- and post-treatment (p-values
  computed using two-sided T-test). E) Heatmap of pathway activity in cells for Pathways
  over-expressed (log2FC > 0.15 and p.adj < 0.01) in VR_C1, VR_C2 and VSC. Note: association
  between two factor variables was tested using Chi-square test'
