caption: Metabolic pathways associated with cardiomyopathy fibroblast subpopulations.
  (a) Heatmap demonstrated the AUCell scores of Top20 metabolism-related pathways
  for 4 fibroblast subpopulations. (b) Heatmap demonstrated the AUCell scores of Top20
  metabolism-related pathways for four groups. (c) Heatmap demonstrated the AUCell
  scores of Top20 metabolism-related pathway for different cell cycles. (d) UMAP plot
  and faceted graph demonstrated the distribution of Oxidative phosphorylation in
  4 fibroblast subpopulations, 4 groups and different cell cycles with high and low
  AUCell scores. (e) Violin plots demonstrated the difference in the expression level
  of Oxidative phosphorylation in the 4 fibroblast subpopulations. (f) Violin plot
  showed the difference in the expression level of Oxidative phosphorylation in 4
  groups. (g) Violin plot demonstrated the expression level differences of Oxidative
  phosphorylation in different cell cycles. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p
  < 0.0001, ns indicates no statistical difference
