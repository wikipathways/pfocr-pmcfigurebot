caption: Antitumor application of Se-AAs. A) SSB NMs effectively suppressed the TGF-β/TGF-β
  RI/Smad2/3/Smad 7 signaling pathway, thereby promoting the expression of NKG2D on
  NK cells and NKG2DL on tumor cells, ultimately enhancing the NK cell-mediated immune
  response. B) The SeCys2 released by SeC-CSNPs and SeC@MSNs-Tf/TAT synergized with
  chemotherapy and radiotherapy to promote the overproduction of intracellular ROS,
  thereby affecting apoptosis-related signaling pathways and ultimately inducing tumor
  cell apoptosis
