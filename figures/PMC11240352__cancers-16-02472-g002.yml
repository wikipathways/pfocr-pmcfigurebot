caption: RAC1 and RAC1B protein domains. (A) Schematic of RAC1 protein domains highlighting
  the switch I and switch II domains that direct the conformational change to facilitate
  GTP binding and subsequent effector protein activation. (B) Schematic of RAC1B protein
  domains including exon 3b, resulting in an additional 19 amino acids following the
  switch II domain. The conformational changes of RAC1 and RAC1B driven by the switch
  I domain directs interactions with downstream effector proteins leading to pathway
  activation. Following the switch II domain is a long C terminal region, also called
  the hypervariable region. The hypervariable region is followed by a polybasic region
  that is then followed by a CAAX motif (C represents cysteine, A represents an aliphatic
  residue, and X represents any amino acid). The CAAX motif in RAC1 and RAC1B is CLLL
  (where L is leucine). The polybasic region and CAAX motif direct RAC1 intracellular
  localization through the prenylation post-translational modification, specifically
  geranylgeranylation [55]. The polybasic region also serves as a nuclear localization
  signal that directs RAC1 to the nucleus where it can impact gene transcriptional
  programs [56]. Figure created in Biorender.com
