caption: Inhibition of PI3K signalling enhances autophagy in canine aVICs. aVICs were
  exposed to DMSO (Control), 60 μM LY294002, 5 μM copanlisib and 50 μM alpelisib treatment
  with 5 μM baflomycin‐A1 (Baf‐A1) for 16 h. (A, B) Representative confocal images
  of LC3‐II marked autophagosomes (green) and quantitative analysis of the number
  of LC3‐II puncta, scale bar 20 μm (n = 98 cells/treatment). (C) Representative western
  blot of ATG3, ATG5, ATG7 and LC3‐II protein expression in aVICs exposed to DMSO
  and PI3K inhibitors. (D–G) Quantification of the relative protein expression of
  ATG3, ATG5, ATG7 and LC3‐II (n = 6). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA
  followed by Tukey's range test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to
  control. ANOVA, analysis of variance; aVIC, activated myofibroblast phenotype.

  and secretory phenotype of valvular interstitial cells through the modulation of
  cellular senescence in a naturally occurring in vitro canine model of myxomatous
  mitral valve disease.
