caption: 'Long-term pasture intake caused redox signaling pathway activation. mRNA
  levels of (A) liver Keap1 and (B) liver Nrf2. (C–L) Protein levels of (C) liver
  HO-1, (D) liver GSH-Px, (E) liver GSR, (F) liver CAT, (G) liver T-SOD, (H) liver
  T-AOC, (I) liver MDA, (J) liver IgA, (K) liver IgG, and (L) liver IgM between the
  two feeding groups. Data were presented as mean ± SD (n = 6). Data with * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 were significant; ns: not significant
  (Student’s t-test, p < 0.05)'
