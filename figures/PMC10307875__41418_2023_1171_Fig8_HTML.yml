figure_title: CircRILPL1-YAP signaling promotes the transcription of CAPN2 and PXN
caption: A The expression levels of CAPN2 and PXN mRNA were examined by qRT-PCR in
  NPC cells after overexpression or knockdown of circRILPL1. B The expressions of
  CAPN2 and PXN protein were examined by western blotting in NPC cells after overexpression
  or knockdown of circRILPL1. C The effects of circRILPL1 and YAP on the expressions
  of CAPN2 and PXN mRNA in NPC cells were detected by qRT-PCR. D The effect of circRILPL1
  on the enrichment of YAP on CAPN2 and PXN promoters was examined by ChIP assay.
  E Schematic diagram of the signaling pathways regulated by circRILPL1 in NPC cells.
  CircRILPL1 inhibits the LATS1 kinase through binding to and activating ROCK1, thereby
  suppressing the phosphorylation of YAP. In cooperation with the nuclear transport
  receptor IPO7, circRILPL1 prompts loading of YAP onto IPO7 and thus enhances YAP
  translocation into nucleus, where YAP activates the transcription of cytoskeleton
  remodeling genes CAPN2 and PXN. CircRILPL1 activates the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway,
  ultimately resulting in biomechanical differences, proliferation, and metastasis
  of NPC cells. Data were presented as the means ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
