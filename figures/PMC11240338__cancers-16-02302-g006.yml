caption: Survival analysis for cancers with other metabolic pathway activities prognostic
  of survival. (A) Survival analysis for cancers where steroid metabolism was prognostic
  of survival. In STAD, BLBC, and BLCA, steroid metabolism pathway activity appears
  to be associated with overall survival. In DLBC, more patients are required to validate
  this effect. (B) Cancers where oxidative phosphorylation was prognostic of overall
  survival. High oxidative phosphorylation was associated with better prognosis in
  LUSC, MESO, and KIRP. (C) Glutathione metabolism pathway activity appeared prognostic
  for CHOL, UCEC, and ESCA. (D) Fatty acid biosynthesis activity appeared prognostic
  in two kidney cancers, KICH and KIRP
