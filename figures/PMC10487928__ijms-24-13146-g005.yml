caption: Delta interactome of the top 20 most connected differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs), defense response to virus genes, angiogenesis genes, adaptive and innate
  immune genes, and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Genes with a purple star are genes that are
  part of the SARS-CoV-2 disease pathway and are found in Delta and Gamma DEGs. Genes
  with a yellow star are genes that are part of the SARS-CoV-2 disease pathway and
  are found only in Delta DEGs
