  cells
caption: |-
  (A) Heatmap of the expression of calcium channel–related genes in obese and WT mice bearing Tet2–/– cells. (B) WB analysis was performed to measure the protein levels of Nfatc3, Irg1, and IL-1β in BM cells from Tet2–/–
  Ob/Ob,
  Tet2–/–, Ob/Ob, and WT mice. (C) Expression of the Nfatc3 gene in Tet2–/–
  Ob/Ob compound mutant mice and control mice BM cells was detected by qRT-PCR. (D) HSC/Ps from Tet2–/–
  Ob/Ob,
  Tet2–/–, Ob/Ob, and WT mice were stimulated or not with 1 μm ionomycin, and Nfatc3 (green) localization was visualized by confocal microscopy. DAPI (red, pseudocolor) was used to stain the nucleus. Red arrow indicate nuclear translocation of Nfat3. Scale bars: 10 μM . The insets show the zoomed images (×2). (E and F) Quantification of the percentage of cells with nuclear Nfatc3 per high-power field using Fiji (ImageJ, NIH). (G) GSEA plot of gene sets related to the Ca2+/calcineurin-activated NFAT pathway that were upregulated in Ob/Ob mice bearing Tet2–/– cells compared with WT mice. NES, normalized enrichment score Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005, ***P < 0.0005, and ****P < 0.0001, by 1-way ANOVA
