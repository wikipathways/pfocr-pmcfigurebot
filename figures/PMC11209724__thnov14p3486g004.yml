caption: m6A modification regulates the polarization of monocyte/macrophage in mediating
  inflammatory responses. (A and B) The m6A levels of mRNA of RAW264.7 cells transfected
  with NC siRNA, METTL3 siRNA (siM3), METTL14 siRNA (siM14) before treatment with
  LPS (500 ng/mL) or CXCL1 (20 ng/mL). The global m6a levels were detected by colorimetric
  (A) and dot blot (B). n = 5 per group. (C) Protein content of iNOS (M1 marker) and
  Arg1 (M2 marker) in RAW264.7 cells after treatment with NC, LPS, LPS+siM3, LPS+siM14.
  (D) qRT-PCR of mRNA levels for M1 markers of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and MMP9. n = 7
  per group. (E) qRT-PCR of mRNA levels for M2 markers of Arg-1, IL-10, SPP1 and YM1.
  n = 7 per group. (F and G) Flow cytometry analysis and quantification of M1 polarization
  (CD86+ CD206-) and M2 polarization (CD86- CD206+) of RAW264.7 cells. n = 4 per group.
  (H) Immunoblot for total lysate of IκBα, p65, p50 and phosphor-p65 (p-p65, Ser536),
  nuclear and cytosolic lysates of p65. (I) Quantification of protein contents of
  p-p65, p65, IκB-α and p-p65/p65 of total lysate normalized to GAPDH and p65 of nuclear
  lysate normalized to Lamin B1. n = 4 per group. (J) Western blotting of JNK, ERK,
  and IRAKM, which are downstream proteins of the TLR4 signaling pathway. (K) Immunofluorescence
  analysis of LPS-induced p65 nuclear translocation. Scale bar, 30 μm. (L) Quantification
  of nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios of p65 immunofluorescence staining. n ≥ 15 per group
  from at least three mice. (M) Firefly & Renilla Luciferase detection using lysates
  from Raw264.7 cells co-transfected with pGL3-NF-κB-Luc and pRL-CMV. n = 7 per group.
  For (A), (D), (E), (G), (I), (L) and (M), n ≥5 per group. The data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD. P-values were determined by one-way ANOVA with Fisher's LSD post-hoc
  test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001.
