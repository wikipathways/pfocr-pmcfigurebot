caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the regulatory mechanism of scutellarin in
  microglia‐mediated neuroinflammation and apoptosis in IS. Scutellarin inhibited
  the NF‐κB pathway, pro‐apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase‐3, and inflammatory factors
  TNF‐α and IL‐1β in microglia after IS. It also promoted the activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β
  pathway and anti‐apoptotic protein Bcl‐2. Conversely, the PI3K pathway inhibitor
  promoted the expression of the NF‐κB pathway, pro‐apoptotic proteins, and inflammatory
  factors while inhibiting the expression of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β pathway and anti‐apoptotic
  protein Bcl‐2. These results suggest that scutellarin regulates activated microglia‐mediated
  neuroinflammation and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β and NF‐κB pathways.
