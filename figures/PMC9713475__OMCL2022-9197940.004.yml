caption: 'Limiting the number of Mets promotes M2 polarization of macrophage/microglia
  in the injured area. (a) Representative fluorescence staining images of CD16/32
  (red) and Iba-1 (green) double-positive cells in the injured area of each group
  at 7 days after the operation. Nuclear (blue). Scale bar: 50 μm. (b) Scatterplot
  of the area of CD16/32+ Iba-1+ cells in each group. The area in DNase I group is
  lower than that in the SCI group but higher than that in the Sham group. (c) Typical
  images of CD206 (red) and Iba-1 (green) double-positive cells in the injured area
  of each group at 7 days after the operation. Scale bar: 50 μm. (d) Scatterplot of
  the area of CD206+ Iba-1+ cells in each group. The comparison results of the area
  of the three groups are the same as b. (e) Representative immunoblots of CD206,
  Arg-1, CD16, and iNOS in the injured area of each group at 7 days after the operation.
  (f) Scatterplot of the relative OD of CD16 and iNOS in each group. The relative
  OD of CD16 and iNOS in the DNase I group is lower than that in the SCI group but
  higher than that in the Sham group. (g) Scatterplot of the relative OD of CD206
  and Arg-1 in each group. The relative OD of CD206 and Arg-1 in the DNase I group
  is considerably higher than that in the SCI group. (h) Scatterplot of CD16, CD32,
  and iNOS mRNA expression in each group using RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR: Real Time-quantitative
  PCR. (i) Scatterplot of CD206, Arg-1, and YM-1 mRNA expression in each group. (j)
  Scatterplot of the cytokine concentrations of IL-1β and IL-10 in each group. Data
  from all the above scatterplots are presented as Mean ± SD (n = 6).  ∗P < 0.05 vs.
  Sham group; #P < 0.05 vs. SCI group (one-way analysis of variance followed by the
  least significant difference test).'
