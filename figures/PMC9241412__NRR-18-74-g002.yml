caption: 'The molecular mechanisms underlying Pin1-regulated apoptosis signaling pathways.In
  AD, reduced levels of Pin1 inhibits GSK-3β enzymatic activity; this could inhibit
  HIF-1 protein degradation and contribute to the expression of the cis isoform of
  pT668-APP. Next, the increased production of Aβ accelerates the formation of the
  cis isoform of pT231-Tau, finally promoting the progression of AD. Furthermore,
  caspase-3 can be activated by the accumulation of Aβ and promotes the formation
  of the cis isoform of pT231-Tau. In TBI, increased levels of DAPK1 inhibits Pin1
  and then promotes the transformation of cis pT231-Tau as well as TBI. In PD, the
  overexpression of Pin1 facilitates the formation and stability of α-synuclein aggregation
  and promotes caspase-3 activation, finally leading to PD. In HD, Htt directly increases
  the activation of p53 and Pin1. Pin1 also interacts with p53 and triggers dissociation
  from its inhibitor iASPP. In addition, the overexpression of Pin1 leads to a reduction
  of Htt accumulation via UPS-mediated degradation. In stroke, increased levels of
  Pin1 promotes the stability of NICD by inhibiting FBW7-mediated poly-ubiquitination,
  up-regulates p53 transactivation, and enhances the production of ROS. In SCI, Pin1
  promotes the degradation of Daxx and then activates the ASK1/JNK signaling pathway;
  this could promote Mcl-1 degradation and Bcl-2 inhibition. Pin1 also binds with
  and mediates a conformational change in pSer65-BIMEL to protect pS65-BIMEL from
  proteasomal degradation, finally leading to neuronal apoptosis. In epilepsy, the
  deletion of Pin1 enhanced AMPA and NMDA receptors by phosphorylating CaMKII, finally
  inducing excitotoxic neuronal death. In age-related neurodegeneration, Pin1 is progressively
  associated with lipofuscin, thus resulting in the generation of ROS; this process
  can be deleterious to neurons. AD: Alzheimer’s disease; AMPA: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
