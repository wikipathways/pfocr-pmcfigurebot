figure_title: The outcomes of the metabolic pathway analysis.
caption: The outcomes of the metabolic pathway analysis. The main differentiating
  metabolites were annotated and analyzed about metabolic pathways. Each bubble on
  the bubble diagram represents a metabolic pathway. Technical term abbreviations
  are explained upon their first use. The horizontal axis and the size of the bubble
  indicate the size of the pathway influencing factor in the topology analysis. The
  greater the scale, the bigger the influencing factor. The vertical position of the
  bubble shows the p-value of the enrichment analysis
