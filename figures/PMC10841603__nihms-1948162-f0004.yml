figure_title: CD97 knockdown impairs glycolytic metabolism in GBM
caption: '(A) Volcano plot derived from bulk RNA-seq data collected from PDGCs lentivirally
  infected with the SCR or CD97 shRNA (n = 3 biological replicates for each). Genes
  involved in canonical glycolysis and glucose transport are represented as large
  yellow points. Genes involved in the TCA cycle and OXPHOS (cytochrome oxidase subunits)
  are represented as large green points. CD97 is represented by an orange point.(B)
  The top ten enriched and depleted pathways determined by the largest fold enrichment
  among downregulated genes using GO PANTHER pathway enrichment analysis. Stars indicate
  metabolic pathways.(C) Correlation matrix from bulk RNA-seq data collected from
  PDGCs following knockdown or overexpression of CD97 shows high correlation between
  CD97 and glycolysis-related genes and anti-correlation with TCA cycle-related genes.
  HK2 (hexokinase 2) and SLC2A3 (glucose transporter 3 [GLUT3]) transcripts are both
  included because they have been implicated in Warburg metabolism.(D) Bar graph showing
  decreased lactate production after knockdown of CD97 (n = 6 per PDGC; two-way ANOVA
  F1,15 = 27.24, p < 0.001) and increased lactate production after CD97 overexpression
  in PDGCs (n = 3 per PDGC; two-way ANOVA F1,6 = 26.07, p < 0.01).(E) Steady-state
  metabolomic data reveal depletion of glycolytic metabolites after knockdown of CD97
  in PDGCs (PN [proneural], n = 2â€“3 [one replicate was removed for technical reasons];
  CL [classical], n = 3).(F) Depleted (red) and enriched (green) heavy-labeled glycolytic
  and TCA cycle metabolites after a heavy-labeled glucose tracing experiment.(G) Representative
  Seahorse Cell Energy Phenotype graph showing OCR and ECAR changes before (baseline)
  and after (maximal) addition of mitochondrial stressors.(H and I) Bar graphs quantifying
  baseline and maximal ECAR (n = 6 per PDGC; baseline: two-way ANOVA F1,10 = 14.06;
  **p < 0.01; maximal: two-way ANOVA F1,10 = 17.87, p < 0.01).(J and K) Bar graphs
  quantifying baseline and maximal OCR (n = 6 per PDGC; baseline: two-way ANOVA F1,10
  = 2.820, p > 0.05; maximal: two-way ANOVA F1,10 = 5.474; *p < 0.05).Error bars indicate
