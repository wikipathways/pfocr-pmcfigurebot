caption: 'Schematic illustration of Nrg1/ErbB signaling. Nrg1 binds to ErbB2/3 heterodimer
  receptors on the cell surface, leading to the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. This activation stimulates mTOR, which regulates protein translation. Concurrently,
  GRB2, SOS, and SHC bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues, activating the GTPase
  RAS and the kinase Raf. Raf subsequently initiates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway,
  culminating in the regulation of gene expression in the nucleus [50,55,59]. Abbreviations:
  Akt: protein kinase B; ErbB: Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2; ERK: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; GRB2: growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; GTPase: guanosine
  triphosphatases; MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR: mammalian target of
  rapamycin; Nrg1: neuregulin 1; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Raf: rapidly accelerated
  fibrosarcoma; RAS: Rat sarcoma; SOS: Son of sevenless'
