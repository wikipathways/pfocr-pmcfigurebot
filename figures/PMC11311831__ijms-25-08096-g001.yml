caption: Analysis of PYCR1 in Pan-cancer. (A) Differential expression analysis of
  PYCR1; (B) results of single-factor Cox regression analysis of PYCR1 with prognosis
  (OS and PFS); (C) visualization of seven pathways enriched by PYCR1 in multiple
  tumors; (D,E) analysis of the expression of PYCR1 with TMB and MSI; (F) analysis
  of the expression of PYCR1 with the infiltration of 22 immune cells; * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
