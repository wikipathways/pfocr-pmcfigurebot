caption: NOX4 derived-ROS activates YAP signaling pathways (A) After down-regulation
  of NOX4, ROS was detected in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells. (B) After up-regulation
  of NOX4, ROS in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells increased, which was reversed by
  treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (a ROS scavenger). (C) After NOX4 was down-regulated,
  the expression of YAP in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells also decreased. (D) After
  up-regulating NOX4 expression, the expression of YAP in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453
  cells was increased, which was reversed by exposure to N-acetyl cysteine (ROS scavenger).
