figure_title: Structures in new conformations complete the Mn2+ transport cycle by
  DraNramp
caption: (A) Schematic of the conformational states that DraNramp traverses to import
  Mn2+. The mobile and stationary parts are pale yellow and light blue, respectively.
  (B) Corresponding structures of DraNramp, showing TMs 1 and 6 in green, TMs 5 and
  10 in pale yellow, and TMs 2, 7, and 11 gray. Stationary TMs 3, 4, 8, and 9 are
  omitted to highlight the key motions in the mobile parts. Mn2+ ions are magenta.
  Black arrows indicate the key motions in TMs 1a and 6a detailed in panel (C), and
  TMs 5 and 10 detailed in . Full structures and the electron density for TMs 1 and
  6 are illustrated in . (C) Pairwise superpositions of whole Mn2+-bound structures
  highlight the motions of TMs 1 and 6. Conformations are indicated at the bottom.
  The distance between residues 46 and 240 in TMs 1a and 6b, indicated for the green
  structures, increases from 5.9 Å to 13.8 Å from outward open to inward open. The
  large angular motions of TM1a and TM6b are also indicated. (D) Plots of B-factor
  by residue for the TM1 region (residues 40–70) and the TM6 region. The B-factors
  are highest for the inward-open state in which the interaction between TMs 1a and
  6b (both in the inner leaflet) is broken.
