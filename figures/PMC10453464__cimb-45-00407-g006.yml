caption: 'Biochemical parameters in the cerebral cortical tissues (relative expression
  levels of Nrf2 (A), and BDNF (B). CPA upregulated the Nrf2/BDNF signaling pathway
  of the acute stressed (AS) group at the end of the experiment. The findings are
  the mean ± SD, n = 6. * p ≤ 0.0001 when compared to the controls; # p ≤ 0.0001 when
  CPA + AS is compared to the AS group'
