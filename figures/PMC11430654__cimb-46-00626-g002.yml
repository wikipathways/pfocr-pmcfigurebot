caption: (A) Illustration of the proposed biosynthetic pathway of β-ODAP biosynthesis
  (ChemDraw), adopted from [81]. The product in brackets (Isoxazolin-5-one) is hypothetical
  and has not been detected in grass pea. BIA is β-(isoxazolin-5-on-2-yl) alanine),
  a precursor of L-DAPA (L- L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid, a final precursor of β-ODAP).
  The light green line indicated the formation of BIA from Isoxazolin-5-one and cysteine
  by the CAS enzyme at high sulfur. The blue line indicates the formation of BIA from
  Isoxazolin-5-one and O-Acetyl serine at low sulfur by CS enzyme. According to our
  conserved domain analysis, CAS is a bifunctional enzyme that may also act as CS.
  (B) Structural illustration of L-Glutamic acid analog that competes for AMPA receptor.
  The structures were drawn using ChemDraw 12.0
