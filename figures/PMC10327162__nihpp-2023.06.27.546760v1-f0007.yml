figure_title: A common feature of mechanotransducive pathways
caption: 'Schematic models of RsgI, Mucin-1 (MUC1), and an adhesion G Protein-Coulped
  Receptor (aGPCR). (A) RsgI undergoes autoproteolysis in its SEAL domain and the
  N (dark purple) and C-terminal (light purple) fragments remain non-covalently associated
  through an undisrupted ß-sheet. (B) MUC1 undergoes autoproteolysis in its SEA domain
  (pdb: 6bsb) and the C- (dark green) and N-terminal (light green) fragments remain
  noncovalently associated. Each cleaved product contributes two strands to the undisrupted
  ß-sheet. MUC1 has a large glycosylated extracellular intrinsically disordered region
  and cytoplasmic signaling proteins associate with its intracellular domain. (C)
  aGPCRs are autoproteolyzed within their GAIN domain (pdb: 4dlq) , and the C-terminal
  (dark blue) and N-terminal (light blue) fragments remain noncovalently associated
  through an undisrupted ß-sheet. One or more extracellular adhesion domains are linked
  to the GAIN domain. The C-terminal strand of the GAIN domain is the tethered peptide
  agonist that, upon exposure, activates G-Protein signaling'
