caption: Pathways with better p-value scores are closely related and involved in cellular
  responses to stimuli, supramolecular fiber organization, and formation of cornified
  envelope. A background and target list (abundance peptide in exosomes from 1% to
  100%) in METASCAPE online server and prediction for Homo sapiens were performed
  with predetermined values. (a) Protein–protein network interaction by pathway in
  colors. (b) Protein–protein network interaction by a pathway red intensity based
  on p-value
