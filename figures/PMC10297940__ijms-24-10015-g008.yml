figure_title: AMPK activation is required for improvement of insulin sensitivity using
  NR in PA-treated skeletal muscle cells.
caption: 'AMPK activation is required for improvement of insulin sensitivity using
  NR in PA-treated skeletal muscle cells. (A) 2-NBDG uptake of C2C12 myotube cells
  in the indicated groups, the microscope magnification is 200×. (B) Representative
  Western blot results of insulin signaling pathway-associated protein (AKT) of cells.
  β-Actin served as a loading control. (C) Quantitative results for WB. * p < 0.05
  compared with the CON group; # p < 0.05 comparing PA group vs. PA + NR group. & p
  < 0.05 PA + NR group vs. PA + NR + Compound C group'
