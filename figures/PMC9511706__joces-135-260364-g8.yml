caption: Graphical summary of pathways driving lamellipodia formation versus LLS formation.
  The canonical pathway leading to lamellipodia formation (black arrows) in cells
  involves active Rac GTPase (green) signaling to recruit and activate the pentameric
  WRC, which in turn activates the heptameric Arp2/3 complex, the major actin nucleator
  in lamellipodia (black arrows). In the absence of WRC, cells cannot activate Arp2/3
  complex by canonical, WRC-mediated activation (crossed-out WRC), yet are able to
  form LLS, at least in specific conditions (for example upon activation of Cdc42,
  blue), challenging the classical paradigm of lamellipodia formation. LLS formation
  (red arrows) also involves Arp2/3 complex, which downstream of Cdc42 is activated
  by N-WASP but not Rac (crossed-out gray arrow). However, despite Cdc42 operating
  through N-WASP, LLS formation still requires Rac activity in a pathway that remains
  to be established (red line and question mark). Aside from this, Rac and Cdc42 GTPases
  may also undergo significant crosstalk (black dashed line), which also requires
  further specification. Note that the pathway leading to LLS formation is less efficient
  than the classical, WRC-driven pathway, and this manifests as (1) lower overall
  frequency of formation, (2) reduced F-actin density and (3) reduced actin network
  width (see representative images and Table S1). This may be due, at least in part,
  to the absence of the Ena/VASP family of actin polymerases in LLS, which is prominent,
  however, in lamellipodia (left). Aside from WRC and Ena/VASP, LLS harbor all canonical
  lamellipodial factors tested (red list on the bottom right). Representative images
  show F-actin staining (using fluorescent phalloidin) for a wild-type B16-F1 cell
  on the left, and a Nap1/Hem1 double KO cell on the right.
