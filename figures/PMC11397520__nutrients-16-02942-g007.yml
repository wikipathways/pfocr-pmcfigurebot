caption: 'Effects of different intervention methods on KEGG metabolic pathway in mice
  at day 42: (a) KEGG metabolic pathways characteristics of CTL, ATBX, EXC, KGM, and
  EK groups at LDA2 level were analyzed via LEfSe, (b) KEGG. pathways level 1 characteristics
  of CTL, ATBX, EXC, KGM, and EK groups at LDA2 level were analyzed by LEfSe (c) KEGG.
  pathways level 2 characteristics of CTL, ATBX, EXC, KGM, and EK groups at LDA2 level
  were analyzed by LEfSe. Samples (N = 15) were colored by treatment. CTL: control;
  ATBX: antibiotic; EXC: exercise; KGM: the native KGM; EK: combination of exercise
  and KGM'
