figure_title: Network analysis of disrupted metabolites in the fentanyl overdose group.
caption: 'Network analysis of disrupted metabolites in the fentanyl overdose group.
  Network analysis illustrating the interactions and relationships between significantly
  altered metabolites in the fentanyl overdose group. Each node represents a specific
  metabolite, while edges (lines) connecting the nodes indicate known biochemical
  interactions. The size of each node corresponds to the magnitude of change in metabolite
  level, with larger nodes representing greater alterations. The color of the edges
  represents the type of correlation between metabolites: red edges denote positive
  correlations (indicating that as the level of one metabolite increases, the level
  of the connected metabolite also increases), while blue edges indicate negative
  correlations (suggesting that as the level of one metabolite increases, the level
  of the connected metabolite decreases). These correlations were determined based
  on the Pearson correlation coefficients derived from the metabolomic data. Central
  hub metabolites, such as arachidonic acid, ribitol, and glycine, are prominently
  affected, indicating their critical role in the response to fentanyl toxicity. The
  network highlights the complexity of metabolic alterations and the interconnected
  nature of disrupted pathways, providing insights into the biochemical impact of
  fentanyl overdose. This analysis underscores the extensive metabolic reprogramming
  that occurs in response to fentanyl toxicity'
