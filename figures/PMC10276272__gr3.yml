caption: Expression patterns of 2 representative genes involved in airway remodeling
  and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. NHBE cells were pretreated with TGF-β1 and
  TGF-β2 (10 ng/ml for 1 h) and stimulated with flagellin (100 ng/ml for 24 h). Data
  are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of 2 independent experiments.
  A-B. The mRNA expression of genes from flagellin unstimulated (open bar) and stimulated
  (closed bar) samples were evaluated. ∗p < 0.05 indicates significant differences
  from unstimulated group. C. Representative Western blot analysis of MMP-9 and MMP-13
  with pretreated and stimulated sample. D. Effect of flagellin on Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway.
