figure_title: IBT induced downstream upregulation of the TNF-α pathway in human neutrophils
caption: '(A) Volcano plot for DEGs in neutrophils treated with 0.3 μM IBT versus
  DMSO (4.5h, unstimulated). DEGs based on log2 fold change and Padj < 0.05. FDRs
  were calculated using the Benjamini-Yekutieli method with 3 biological replicates
  per condition. Red and blue dots represent upregulated and downregulated genes,
  respectively. (B) TNF-α KEGG pathway was created for all probed genes for IBT-treated
  neutrophils versus DMSO. Genes in white boxes are genes not included in the nCounter
  panel. Numbers in circles represent pathways: (1) MAPK signaling pathway; (2) ubiquitin-mediated
  proteolysis; (3) NF-κB signaling pathway; and (4) PI3K/Akt signaling pathway'
