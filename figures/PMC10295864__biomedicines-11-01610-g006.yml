caption: In situ delivering of scFv to tumor sites by vectors. (A) In situ delivery
  and production system of Trastuzumab scFv by Gene-Engineered Bifidobacterium. Bifidobacterium,
  a strict anaerobic bacterium, explicitly targets the hypoxic environment of tumors,
  being a transformed bacterium that expresses anti-HER2 scFv, and this antibody blocks
  the HER2-mediated signaling pathways. (B) The administration system of an anti-p21Ras
  scFv by transfected CIK cells. Recombinant adenoviruses loaded with the anti-p21Ras
  scFv gene can enter CIK cells, replicate, and intracellularly express anti-p21Ras
  scFv
