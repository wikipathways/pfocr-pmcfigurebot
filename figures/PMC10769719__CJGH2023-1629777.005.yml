  of the NF-κB signaling pathway in septic rats.
caption: 'Ghrelin/GHSR axis activated E2F1 expression and suppressed the activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway in septic rats. (a–c) The mRNA levels of E2F1, IκB,
  and p65 in colon tissues of septic rats were detected by RT-qPCR. (d–f) Proteins
  in cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were determined using Western blot. ((g), (h))
  Nuclear translocation of p65 was determined using immunofluorescence. The scale
  labels shown are 50 µm and 20 µm. The white arrows indicate the nuclear translocation
  of p65. ∗∗P < 0.01 (vs sham group), #P < 0.05 (vs CLP group), ##P < 0.01 (vs CLP
  group), &P < 0.05 (vs ghrelin group), and &&P < 0.01 (vs ghrelin group)'
