caption: Gene expression comparison among our study, the PyMT, and Wnt1 tumor models,
  as well as human breast cancer data. (a) Networking among differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) and pathways identified commonly in our study and the study by Cai
  et al. using PyMT mouse model [87]. The top 17 pathways were identified, sharing
  at least 5 or more common genes from both studies. Cytoscape was used to create
  the network using an organic layout. The network comprised 156 nodes and 271 edges.
  Red and green ellipse shapes represent up- and down-regulated genes with in KEGG
  pathways, respectively. The orange octagon shapes represent individual pathways.
  (b) Gene expression analysis between our study and Wnt1 early mouse model. Red and
  green boxes represent up- or down-regulated genes in both studies, respectively.
  (c,d) Functional analysis of key hub genes with panel (c) showing expression of
  key hub genes retrieved from RNAseq expression from profiles of all human breast
  cancer patients. The expression pattern of 12 hub genes in 10,967 human breast cancer
  samples was analyzed. (d) Clustering of hub genes and human breast cancer samples
  from the TCGA database. The expression pattern of the 12 hub genes in 1,084 samples
  was analyzed with respect to gene expression and tumor stage. The figure shows only
  the cluster containing our data. Red = up-regulated genes; Green = down-regulated
  genes
