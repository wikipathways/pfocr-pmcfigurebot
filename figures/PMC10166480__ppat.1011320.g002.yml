figure_title: IL6-STAT3 signaling pathway mediates temperature-dependent GCRV infection
caption: (A-B) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs from transcriptomic data related
  to CIK cells by temperature-switch treatment from 18°C to 28°C (NCBI SRA database
  accession number PRJNA862271) (A) and grass carp head kidney by GCRV infection (NCBI
  SRA database accession number PRJNA759556) (B). The top 20 significantly enriched
  pathways (ranked by p-value) are shown in the bar graph. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis of transcriptomic data from grass carp head kidney by GCRV infection at
  28°C was presented in the form of scatterplots based on enrichment factor and p-value.
  The enrichment factor is the ratio between the DEG number and the number of all
  genes in a certain gene enrichment term. The sizes of the dots denote the number
  of DEGs, while colors correspond to the p-value. (D) Heat map analysis of DEGs that
  were up-regulated in the GCRV-infected spleen tissue was summarized (NCBI SRA database
  accession number PRJNA759556). (E) Transcriptomic data of all genes differentially
  regulated from GCRV-infected spleen samples of grass carp (NCBI SRA database accession
  number PRJNA600033) were analyzed by volcano plot analysis. (F) Transcriptomic data
  from (E) profiling some upregulated pro-inflammatory genes were analyzed by heat
  map analysis. (G) CIK cells under temperature-switch treatment from 18°C to 28°C
  were harvested to analyze the expression of pro-inflammatory genes by RT-PCR. (H)
  CIK cells infected with GCRV (MOI = 5) under different temperatures (18°C, 28°C)
  were harvested to quantify the expression of IL6 by RT-PCR. (I-L) The relative proliferation
  of the GCRV genome (with the VP4 primer pair) and expression of IL6 in the spleen
  (I-J) and gills (K-L) of grass carp from different time points were quantified by
  RT-PCR. (M-N) CIK cells under temperature-switch treatment from 18°C to 28°C for
  1 h were harvested to analyze the signal of STAT3 and the IL6-STAT3 axis transcription
  by Western blotting analysis (M) and RT-PCR (N), respectively. STAT3 phophorylation
  specific antibody (Y705) was probed to dictate the activation of STAT3. The density
  of the Western blot bands was quantified using ImageJ software. (O) CIK cells pre-treated
  with STAT3 inhibitor Stattic (1μM) were infected with GCRV (MOI = 5) at 28°C and
  harvested to analyze the relative viral genome level by RT-PCR with the VP7 primer
  pair. (P-Q) CIK cells pre-treated with different doses of STAT3 inhibitor Stattic
  (0.5 μM, 1 μM, 2 μM) were infected with GCRV (MOI = 5) at 28°C and harvested to
  analyze the expression of IL6 (P) and relative viral genome level (O) by RT-PCR
  with the VP7 primer pair. Data were presented as mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA between different
  groups and the asterisk (*) indicates significant differences between groups. *
