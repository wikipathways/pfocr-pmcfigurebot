caption: 'Interactions between M. catarrhalis and A549 cells explored using RNA sequencing.
  (A) Differential expression analysis. (a) Venn mapping depicting differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in different groups. (bâ€“d) Volcano plot presenting the upregulated
  and downregulated DEGs in the infected group compared with those in the control
  group (red: upregulated; green: downregulated; blue: no significant change). (e)
  The heatCluster graph of DEG samples between different groups. (B) Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment between the infected and control
  groups. A549 is a non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. Data analysis excluded A549
  cell line background pathways, such as cancer pathways, Kaposi sarcoma-associated
  herpesvirus infection, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications'
