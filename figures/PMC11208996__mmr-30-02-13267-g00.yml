caption: Schematic graph illustrating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and its roles
  in the regulation of various biological processes during chronic kidney disease.
  TGF-β ligands, initially synthesized as latent forms, bind to TGF-βRII upon release.
  This interaction recruits and activates TGF-βRI, leading to the phosphorylation
  of intracellular Smad2/3. Subsequently, phosphorylated Smad2/3 forms a complex with
  Smad4, which then translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. Conversely,
  Smad7 disrupts TGF-β signaling by competing with Smad2/3 for TGF-βRI and facilitating
  TGF-βRII degradation. Red arrows or symbols denote pathogenic mechanisms or pathways
  of positive regulation, whereas blue lines or symbols signify protective mechanisms
  or pathways of negative regulation. TGF, transforming growth factor; TGF-βR, TGF-β
