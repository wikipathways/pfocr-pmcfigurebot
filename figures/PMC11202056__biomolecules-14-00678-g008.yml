caption: STRING pathway analysis depicting protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks.
  (A) PPI network for ICH vs. normal; (B) PPI network of severe ICH vs. normal; and
  (C) PPI network of severe ICH vs. ICH. The analysis parameters were set with a high-confidence
  score threshold (0.7) to ensure the specificity of interactions
