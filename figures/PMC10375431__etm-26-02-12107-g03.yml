figure_title: Effect of CFH on cell migration-related signaling pathways in HUVECs.
caption: Effect of CFH on cell migration-related signaling pathways in HUVECs. Western
  blot analysis of proteins extracted from HUVECs incubated with CFH-containing conditioned
  medium or control medium. (A) ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2, (B) JNK and p-JNK, (C) p38 MAPK
  and p-p38 MAPK, (D) TGF-Î²RI, (E) Smad2 and p-Smad2, and (F) Smad3 and p-Smad3 were
  detected. The p-ERK and ERK have bands at 42 and 44 kDa. For p-Smad, the band for
  the small molecule is correct. The other band is non-specific. GAPDH was used as
  a loading control. n=3. Con, control; CFH, complement factor H; HUVECs, human umbilical
  vein endothelial cells; p-, phosphorylated
