caption: Salt-stress-induced changes in the expression of genes encoding enzymes of
  the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in leaves of rice seedlings. (A) Common branch.
  (B) Chlorophyll branch. Actin was used as an internal control. The control sample
  was used as a calibrator, with its expression level set to 1. Data are means ± SE
  of nine replicates obtained from three independent experiments. Mean values followed
  by different lowercase letters are significantly different at p < 0.05 by Duncan’s
  test
