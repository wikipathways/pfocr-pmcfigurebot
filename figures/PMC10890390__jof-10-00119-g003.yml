figure_title: Reconstruction of the NAG biosynthetic pathway in S.
caption: 'Reconstruction of the NAG biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae. (a) The
  NAG synthesis pathway from p-CA in S. cerevisiae. This is followed by the conversion
  of p-CA into NAG via three enzymatic steps: 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (Pc4CL), chalcone
  synthase (PhCHS), and chalcone isomerase 1 (MsCHI). (b) Promoterâ€“ORF combinations
  used in the combinatorial promoter library for fine-tuning the expression of enzymes
  in the NAG biosynthetic pathway. (c) HPLC profile of strain N23. (d) The effect
  of different combinations of promoters in the NAG biosynthetic pathway on NAG production
  with the supplementation of p-CA as a precursor. (e) Final results of construction
  of the de novo biosynthetic pathway for NAG in S. cerevisiae. p-CA and NAG production
  as well as OD600 readings for strain N23. All data represent the mean of n = three
  biologically independent samples, and error bars show standard deviation'
