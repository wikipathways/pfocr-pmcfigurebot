caption: 'Mechanisms of intestinal flora-mediated regulation of the tumor microenvironment.
  Metabolites: i) Metabolites of flora: SCFAs can be transmitted to the liver through
  the portal vein to produce bile acid and change the tumor microenvironment. Butyrate
  and tryptophan affect the development of tumors by affecting their immune response.
  ii) Intestinal metabolites: Intestinal metabolism produces polyphenol analogues,
  changes the type of gut microbiota, stimulates the production of SCFAs and reshape
  the tumor microenvironment. Non-hematopoietic components of the intestinal membrane:
  When intestinal epithelial cells lack ubiquitin ligase, the secretion of intestinal
  cathelicidin decreases, and epithelial cells die, which causes changes in the gut
  microbiota and regulates the tumor immune microenvironment. Genotoxins: PKS gene-positive
  Escherichia coli can destroy the single-stranded DNA of intestinal cells, playing
  an indirect role in the development of CRC, and colon epithelial cells can cause
  DNA damage and activate Wnt and NF under the action of fragile bacteroid toxins-ÎºB.
  STAT3 and other colon epithelial signal transduction pathways affect the self-renewal
  of colon mucosal epithelial cells and promote tumor formation. Metabolic reprogramming:
  The tumor microenvironment provides nutrients for malignant proliferation and metastasis
  of tumor cells by changing the metabolism of different components of the tumor microenvironment.
  Anaerobic glycolysis of tumor cells produces lactic acid, which can stimulate the
  production of hyaluronic acid and the expression of CD44, and is conducive to tumor
  metastasis. The hypoxic acidic tumor microenvironment caused by aerobic glycolysis
  inhibits the normal metabolism of immune cells and T cell function. Tumor cells
  mediate the metabolism of tryptophan in T cells by overexpressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase in order to transform tryptophan into caninurenine
  and its metabolites. Lack of tryptophan and accumulation of caninurenine metabolites
  would inhibit the function of effector T cells. Immune reprogramming: i) Immune
  escape: Bacteroides fragilis, as an inducer of forkhead box P3+ (a powerful inducer
  that mediates gastrointestinal immunity and peripheral tolerance), can induce the
  production of IL-10-mediated mucosal surface tolerance, which can induce the generation
  of Tregs, while symbiotic microorganisms can promote the escape of pDCs. Both pDCs
  and Tregs work together to mediate immune escape; ii) reprogramming of immune cells:
  STING agonists derived from microbiota induce the production of IFN-I through mononuclear
  phagocytes in tumors, thus forming an antitumor microenvironment. By regulating
  the natural killer cell-DC crosstalk, the content of IFN-I is regulated, reshaping
  the tumor microenvironment, and facilitating the response to immune checkpoint blockade.
  In the absence of PTEN (gene of phosphate and tension homology deleted on chromosome
  ten) expression, miRNA expression and the proinflammatory bacteria Akkermania muciniphila
  in the gut microbiota decrease, forming a microenvironment that inhibits tumor growth.
  When the gut microbiota is altered, the lipopolysaccharide content, the expression
  of the cathepsin K gene and the risk of colon cancer cell metastasis increase. Due
  to the loss of miRNA, succinate produced by the microbiota accumulates in the colon,
  leading to diarrhea in weaned piglets. SCFAs, short-chain fatty acids; CRC, colorectal
