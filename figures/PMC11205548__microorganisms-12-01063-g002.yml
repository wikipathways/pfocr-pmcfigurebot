caption: Time course of FLO degradation by resting cells of P. salicylatoxidans CGMCC
  1.17248 and the proposed metabolic pathway. (A) FLO (initial concentration, 0.99
  mmol/L) was degraded by resting cells of P. salicylatoxidans CGMCC 1.17248. Standard
  deviations were calculated from triplicate samples from three parallel cultures
  (n = 9). The density (OD600) of resting cell suspensions was adjusted to 5. (B)
  The metabolite pathways of FLO in microorganisms
