  after 7 days.
caption: Transcriptome changes in BMMSCs cultured in ECMs with different stiffnesses
  after 7 days. (A–C) Volcano plots of the DEGs based on both magnitude of the p value
  and fold changes (FCs) in (A) medium group compared with soft group, (B) stiff group
  compared with medium group, and (C) stiff group compared with soft group. (D–F)
  Heatmap of typical DEGs associated with (D) osteogenesis, (E) chondrogenesis, and
  (F) adipogenesis between MSCs cultured in ECMs with three different stiffnesses.
  K-means clusters are indexed using colored bars. (G) GO enrichment analysis of the
  down-regulated genes in stiff-vs-soft groups. (H) KEGG pathway analysis of up-regulated
  genes in stiff-vs-soft groups. (I) KEGG pathway analysis of down-regulated genes
  in stiff-vs-soft groups
