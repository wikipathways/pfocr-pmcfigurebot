caption: Pathways involved in radiation therapy resistance in GBM. Radiation treatment
  produces ROS that cause DNA damage and ultimately result in cell death. GBM has
  hypoxic regions that can be observed on MRI. Hypoxic regions cause a decrease in
  oxygen thus preventing the formation of ROS, which leads to futile cell death. Within
  GBM tumors, there are GSCs that have stem-like properties. Radiation treatment eliminates
  differentiated cells, while GSCs are radioresistant. Tumor heterogeneity is a leading
  contributor in treatment resistance in GBM. Through several permutations, tumors
  have multiple ways of becoming radioresistant. The image was created using BioRender.com.
  GBM, glioblastoma; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GSCs, glioma stem cells; PTEN,
  phosphatase and tensin homolog
