  increased resistance to oxidative stress for all cell types.
caption: Inhibition or depletion of cholesterol during 3D spheroid formation increased
  resistance to oxidative stress for all cell types. (A) Significant enrichment and
  upregulation of the antioxidant activity gene sets via GSEA in ESCs, MSCs, and cancer
  cells cultured in 3D vs. 2D conditions. (B) IPA-based pathway analysis for the nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2; gene symbol Nfe2l2)-mediated antioxidant
  response of 3D- vs. 2D-cultured MSCs. Upregulated genes are indicated in red and
  downregulated genes in green. Solid and dashed lines indicate direct and indirect
  interactions, respectively. Results and individual gene expression levels for 3D-
  vs. 2D-cultured ESCs and cancer cells are shown in Figure S4. (C) qPCR analysis
  for expression levels of Nrf2 in ESCs, MSCs, and cancer cells cultured in 2D and
  3D conditions; Gapdh, internal control. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. ***, p
  < 0.001, and ****, p < 0.0001, compared with 2D cultured conditions. (D) qPCR analysis
  for expression levels of Nrf2 in ESCs, MSCs, and cancer cells cultured in 3D conditions
  with Mev (1 μM), MβCD (1.5 mM), or 1.5 mM MβCD + 100 μg/mL cholesterol treatment;
  Gapdh, internal control. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. ****, p < 0.0001, compared
  to 3D control or between conditions as indicated by bar. (E) Live (green signal)/dead
  (red signal) staining of 2D-and 3D-cultured cells with or without hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2; 500 nM for 2 h) and/or MβCD (1.5 mM) treatment. Scale bar, 25 μm. Bar figures
  represent quantification of the live and dead cell percentage in each condition
