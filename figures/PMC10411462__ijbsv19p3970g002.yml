  cells in vitro and in vivo.
caption: Niraparib promotes the accumulation of DNA damage in thyroid cancer cells
  in vitro and in vivo. (A) Volcano plot of the gene expression changes that occurred
  in Cal-62 cells treated with niraparib assayed by RNA-Seq. Summary of the GO enrichment
  analysis (B) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (C) of differentially expressed
  genes in Cal-62 cells treated with niraparib. (D) Heatmap from the RNA-Seq data
  showing the differentially expressed genes involved in the double-strand break repair
  process. (E) GSEA determined significant enrichment for DNA damage response and
  repair genes correlated with niraparib treatment. (F) IF assay determined phospho-γH2A
  level of thyroid cancer cell lines treated with niraparib. Cell lines were exposed
  to PARP inhibitors with 5 uM for 48h. (G) Analysis of cell cycle distribution of
  thyroid cancer cell lines treated with niraparib by flow cytometry. Cell lines were
  exposed to PARP inhibitors with 5 uM for 48h. (H) Representative images of IHC of
  phospho-γH2A of tumors treated with niraparib. The data are presented as the mean
  ± SD. All *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
