figure_title: KEGG enrichment pathway for genes in the secondary metabolite enrichment
  pathway.
caption: 'KEGG enrichment pathway for genes in the secondary metabolite enrichment
  pathway. Note: The horizontal coordinate is the ratio of the number of differential
  genes annotated to the total number of differential genes in the KEGG enrichment
  pathway, and the vertical coordinate is the KEGG enrichment pathway. The size of
  the dots in the graph represents the number of genes annotated to the KEGG enrichment
  pathway, and the colors from red to purple represent the significance of the enrichment'
