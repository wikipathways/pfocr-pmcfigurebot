figure_title: Transcriptome analysis of naive CD4+ T cells and the exploration of
  FOXO1 in the database
caption: A Heat map of DEGs in naive CD4+ T cells with or without liver IRI (n = 3
  per group). B Heat map of Th17 cells related genes in DEGs. C Heat map of Treg-related
  genes in DEGs. D DEGs enrichment signaling pathway. E Venn diagram representing
  the intersection of two sets of DEGs-related transcription factors. F Analysis of
  protein-protein relationships between FOXO1 and the genes on the Th17 cells differentiation
  pathway by STRING database. G Correlations between FOXO1 and IRF5, STAT5B, FOXP3,
  and DNMT1. H OS and RFS were determined to study the significance of FOXO1 on HCC
  patients. I Clinical information on FOXO1.
