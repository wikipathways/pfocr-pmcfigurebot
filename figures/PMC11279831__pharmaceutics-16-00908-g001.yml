figure_title: The IL-36 signaling pathway.
caption: 'The IL-36 signaling pathway. Keratinocytes secrete IL-36 cytokines as precursors.
  These are cleaved, becoming biologically active, and bind to IL-36 on the surface
  of keratinocytes, inducing an inflammatory cascade that promotes IL-36 expression.
  IL-36 cytokines also induce the expression of numerous cytokines, neutrophilic chemokines,
  and lymphokines, further propagating this pro-inflammatory cycle. AP-1-activating
  protein-1, CARD caspase recruitment domain, CCL chemokine (C–C motif) ligand, CXCL
  chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand, IL interleukin, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase,
  mRNA messenger RNA, NET neutrophil extracellular trap, NFκB nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells, R receptor RA receptor antagonist, RAcP receptor accessory
  protein, and TNF tumor necrosis factor. Image retrieved from Marrakchi et al. 2022
