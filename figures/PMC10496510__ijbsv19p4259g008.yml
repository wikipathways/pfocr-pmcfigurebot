caption: PAI-1 expression in clinical samples and the proposed signalling pathway.
  (A) PAI-1 expression in tumor samples derived from 107 melanoma patients was determined
  by IHC staining of a tissue microarray. Samples were sorted into several groups
  from low to high according to the staining intensity. (B) Percentages of patients
  with different expression levels of PAI-1 according to sample type. (C) IHC staining
  of PAI-1 in TNBC tumors. (D) TNBC case percentage from stages I to III based on
  the expression levels. (E) Case percentages of PAI-1 levels between the non-TNBC
  and TNBC groups. (F) The schematics illustrate the proposed signalling pathway through
  which coculture of tumor cells with platelets promotes cell survival, migration,
  invasion and colony formation capacities in vitro and tumorigenesis and metastasis
  in mice

  metastasis by activating the TGFβ/Smad/PAI-1 and PI3K/AKT pathways
