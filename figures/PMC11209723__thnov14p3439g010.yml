caption: Validation of therapeutic effects and molecular mechanism of MPS-based individualized
  treatment in the mouse models. (A) MPS-I and MPS-II NB xenografts isolated from
  euthanized nude mouse models exposed to different treatments. (B) H&E-staining sections
  of MPS-I and MPS-II NB xenografts exposed to MPS-based individualized treatment.
  (C) Growth curves of treated MPS-I and MPS-II NB xenografts. (D) and (E), results
  of ki67 staining revealed the in vivo proliferation inhibition effects of MPS-based
  individualized treatment against its sensitive NB subtypes. (F) and (H), TUNEL assay
  confirmed the in vivo pro-apoptotic effects of MPS-based individualized treatment
  against its sensitive NB subtypes. (G) and (L), expression of key pro-apoptotic
  proteins and anti-apoptotic protein involved in mitochondrial pathway in the treated
  MPS-I and MPS-II NB xenografts. (I) and (J), in the established MPS-I and MPS-II
  NB pulmonary metastasis models, the in vivo anti-metastatic effects of MPS-based
  individualized treatment against its sensitive NB subtypes. (K), overall survival
  of treated MPS-I and MPS-II NB pulmonary metastasis mouse models. All the scale
  bars are 50Î¼m.
