caption: Temporally correlated clusters of DEGs in K-means clusters show differential
  pathway activation/inhibition in HG compared to NG conditions. (A) Signalling pathways
  obtained from enrichment analysis using IPA of the ‘late’ DEGs cluster determined
  from the pairwise comparison of 0 h vs 4 h NG/HG. (B) Signalling pathways obtained
  from enrichment analysis using IPA of the ‘4 h downregulated’ DEGs cluster determined
  at the pairwise comparison of 1 h vs 4 h NG/HG. A right-tailed Fisher’s Exact test
  was used to measure significance of the pathway enrichment in the gene sets. The
  horizontal bars show the level of significance (−log10 p-value). The colour coding
  of bars indicates activation/inhibition determined by the z-score (generated using
  fold change and curated pathway relationships from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base), > or < 2
  respectively. Hashed bars show significant z-scores. Signalling pathways of interest
  are highlighted by colour coded boxes.
