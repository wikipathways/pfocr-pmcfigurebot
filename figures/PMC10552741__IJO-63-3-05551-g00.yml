caption: Effect of IPAT on cell proliferation and the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in
  endometrial cancer cells. HEC-1A and ECC-1 cells were treated with a range of concentrations
  of IPAT for 72 h. (A) MTT results demonstrated that IPAT inhibited cell proliferation
  in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. (B) IPAT reduced colony formation
  in both cell lines. (C) Treatment of both cell lines with 5 ÂµM IPAT for 30 min enhanced
  the protein expression levels of p-AKT and decreased those of p-S6, and these effects
  of IPAT persisted for at least 30 h. (D) Different concentrations of IPAT effectively
  increased phosphorylation of AKT and downregulated phosphorylation of S6 in both
  cell lines. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01. IPAT, ipatasertib; p, phosphorylated; C, control
