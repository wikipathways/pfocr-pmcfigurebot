caption: Absorption and metabolic pathways of inorganic Se and Se-AAs. Inorganic Se
  (selenate and selenite) could be stepwise reduced to produce H2Se, which is the
  bridge connecting inorganic Se metabolism and organic Se metabolism, via the intermediate
  selenodiglutathione. Meanwhile, Se-AAs (SeMet, SeCys, and MeCys) could also be converted
  to H2Se, followed by its transformation into selenophosphate for the synthesis of
  selenoproteins. Furthermore, H2Se is excreted through methylation reactions
