caption: BdGF14g interacted with NtABF2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay and transcript
  expression analyses of the ABA signaling pathway. (A) BdGF14g was transferred into
  the pGBKT7 vector, and NtABF2 was cloned into the pGADT7 vector, followed by their
  co-transfection into the AH109 strain, and spotted onto the nutritional selective
  solid media SD/-Trp-Leu, SD/-Trp-Leu-Ade, and SD/-Trp-Leu-His-Ade. The transformants
  pGADT7-T, pGBKT7-p53, and pGBKT7-LaminC represent the controls. (B) The transcript
  expression levels of ABA-related genes NtABF2, NtNCED1, and NtERD10C. The error
  bars were calculated based on three independent replicates. Asterisks indicate marked
  differences in statistics (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01)
