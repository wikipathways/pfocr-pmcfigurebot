caption: KEGG pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the stems
  and leaves of ETH-treated ramie. (A) Enriched KEGG pathways of DEGs between CK-Y
  and B-Y. (B) Enriched KEGG pathways of DEGs between CK-J and B-J. Different colors
  in the circles represent the top 20 enriched pathways, the number of DEGs, the fold
  change in DEGs, and the rich factor value for each pathway
