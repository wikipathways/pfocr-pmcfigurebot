caption: Ehmt2 is crucial for maintaining faithful transcriptional homeostasis in
  response to injury during acute pancreatitis. (A) PCA based on DEGs from RNA-seq
  conducted on pancreas tissue from Ehmt2 +/+  and Ehmt2 fl/fl  adult mice both with
  and without induction of acute pancreatitis is shown. Venn diagram illustrates the
  overlap in significant DEGs between mice treated with caerulein and untreated mice,
  comparing Ehmt2 +/+  and Ehmt2 fl/fl  animals for both (B) upregulated and (C) downregulated
  genes. (D) Heatmap displays the average expression of DEGs that were significant
  in at least one condition for Ehmt2 +/+  and Ehmt2 fl/fl  animals in absence or
  presence of caerulein treatment. (E) MSigDB Hallmarks pathway enrichment analysis
  of significant DEGs between mice treated with caerulein and untreated mice in both
  Ehmt2 +/+  and Ehmt2 fl/fl  animals is shown for upregulated and downregulated genes.
