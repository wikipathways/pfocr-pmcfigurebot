figure_title: ER stress marker expression is increased in both Aga2+/â€“ perichondrial
  and chondrocyte cell populations
caption: (A) Heatmap showing differential expression of UPR signaling pathway components
  as indicators of ER stress in perichondrial clusters. (B) Illustration showing the
  UPR pathways, highlighting that increased expression was mainly seen in the PERK
  pathway (green arrows). ERAD, ER-associated protein degradation; XBP-1, X-box binding
  protein 1. (C) Heatmap showing differential expression of UPR signaling pathway
  components as indicators of ER stress in resting and differentiating chondrocyte
  clusters. NS spaces represent differential expression values that were not significant
