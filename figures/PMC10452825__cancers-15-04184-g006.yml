caption: (A) Network representation of some of the hsa-miR-483-5p and hsa-miR-19b-3p
  targets. To obtain this reduced network, miR-483-5p-target AKR1C3â€™s first neighbours
  were selected resulting in UBE2W. Afterwards, the first neighbours of UBE2W were
  selected to create the present network. The targets of miR-483-5p are represented
  in green, and the targets for miR-19b in orange. (B) Gene ontology annotation using
  the genes present in the network. Besides the connection to the metabolism of anthracycline
  doxorubicin, other important functions such as the Wnt signalling pathway or the
  negative regulation by microRNAs have been identified using these genes
