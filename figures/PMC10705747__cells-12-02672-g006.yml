caption: Schematic overview of CBD’s neuroprotective mechanism in Aβ-induced impairments.
  CBD can potentially modulate neuroinflammatory pathways, thus inhibiting inflammatory
  factor release and reducing synaptic damage. Concurrently, CBD augments neurotrophic
  factor expression, ensuring neuronal protection and ameliorating cognitive and memory
  deficits in AD mice. Downward arrows indicate negative regulation and upward arrows
  indicate positive regulation
