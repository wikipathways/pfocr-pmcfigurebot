caption: Crosstalk between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and host cell Ca2+dynamics. Host cell
  Ca2+signaling regulates all four stages of viral life cell i.e., 1. Attachment to
  the host cell; 2. Entry; 3. Replication and 4. Egress. SARS-CoV-2 entry into the
  host cell is mediated by the interaction of viral S-protein with the host ACE2 surface
  receptors. The process is facilitated by cell surface serine protease-TMPRSS2, which
  cleaves S1/S2 subunits of the S-protein. Ca2+ plays an important role in manipulating
  viral entry. S-protein-integrin interaction is possibly maneuvered by Ca2+. Calmodulin,
  a downstream target protein of Ca2+ can regulate infection by altering ACE2 stability.
  Following entry, early endosomal conversion to late endosomes is mediated by PIKfyve
  enzyme which synthesizes PI(3,5)P2. Apilimod, a drug targeting PIKfyve enzyme is
  in phase 2 clinical trial. Viral replication and protein synthesis begins following
  viral fusion with the endo-lysosome and release of viral RNA into the host. Tetrandrine
  targets Ca2+efflux channel-TPC2 localized on the endo-lysosomal system to inhibit
  viral entry. A small molecule, Auxora inhibits Orai1 to limit the sustained Ca2+influx
  into the cytosol via SOCE. It can tackle the uncontrolled cytokine storm and inflammation
  involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Crosstalk between several viral and host proteins
  modulate host cellular processes. ORF9c interacts with ETC complexes and OMM proteins
  to regulate oxidative phosphorylation and MAVS, respectively. Viral M-protein interacts
  with mitochondrial protein CCDC58 leading to reduced mitochondrial CRC. Several
  SARS proteins such as NSP6, ORF3a, ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 interact with mPTP causing
  pore opening, OCR reduction and mitochondrial dysfunction. Viral NSP4 interacts
  with IMM proteins to regulate mitochondrial morphology and convoluted membranes
  formation. Interaction between host TRPML3 and viral ORF3a plays a crucial role
  in lysosomal exocytosis by manipulating cytosolic Ca2+levels and interacting with
  key proteins involved in the exocytic pathway, thereby promoting egress of mature
  virions.
