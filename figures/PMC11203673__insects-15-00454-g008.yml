figure_title: Pathway enrichment analysis of metabolic responses in H.
caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of metabolic responses in H. mutabilis to B.
  tabaci infestation. Three bubble charts represent KEGG pathway enrichment based
  on metabolomics data from H. mutabilis varieties post B. tabaci infestation. (A)
  CBB compared with its four-day post-infestation state (CBB-4d), (B) BRHC-4d compared
  with BRHC, and (C) JQS-4d compared with JQS. Each bubble in the charts indicates
  a specific metabolic pathway, with color showing the significance level (âˆ’log10
  p-value), size reflecting the number of enriched metabolites, and position on the
  x-axis (Impact) illustrating the pathway influence based on topology-analysis-derived
  impact scores
