figure_title: Regulation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by andrographolide.
caption: Regulation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by andrographolide. Activation
  of this process is the result of reactions outside of the cell, in which cytokines,
  IFN and IL, attach to their specific receptors, resulting in JAK proteins phosphorylating
  each other. JAK phosphorylates both the binding site of the STAT protein receptor
  and the STAT protein on its retained tyrosine residues, forming a complex STAT molecule
  in the cytoplasm. This molecule travels to the nucleus and attaches to the DNA,
  initiating the expression of genes. Types of receptors include growth factor receptors,
  IL receptors and G-protein-associated receptors. JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; P,
  phosphorylation
