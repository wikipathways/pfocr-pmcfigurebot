caption: (a) Principal component analysis (PCA) of sorghum–sudangrass hybrids treated
  with SCBZSX5 and healthy sorghum–sudangrass hybrids. (b) Using GraphPad Prism 8.0
  software to create volcano maps, the purple part indicates that the differential
  metabolites are up-regulated, the blue part indicates that the differential metabolites
  are down-regulated, and the gray part indicates the insignificant metabolites. (c)
  Differential metabolite classification chart created using Excel 2019. (d) Differential
  metabolism chemicals were analyzed using Metaboanalyst 5.0 for important metabolic
  pathways, the KEGG database was used to annotate and construct the pathway, the
  x-axis denotes the pathway impact, the y-axis represents pathway enrichment, the
  circle size denotes pathway to impact, and the circle color from red to yellow represents
  the p-value (p < 0.05) becoming smaller. (e–g) Using the online graphing tool Metware
  Cloud and GraphPad Prism 8.0 software, potential differential metabolites were screened
  according to different projected significance (VIP > 1 and p < 0.05), and differential
  metabolites’ heat maps of flavonoids and isoflavones, differential metabolites’
  heat maps of lipid and lipid molecules, heat maps of differential metabolites of
  organic acids, and their derivatives were generated
