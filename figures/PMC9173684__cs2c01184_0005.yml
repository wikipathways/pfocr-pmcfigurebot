figure_title: Fluorometabolite Biosynthesis Pathways and Reactions Catalyzed by Fluorinase/Chlorinase
caption: 'Reactions catalyzed by fluorinase/chlorinase are indicated in gray: (I)
  forward fluorination reaction, (II) forward chlorination reaction, and (III) reverse
  chlorination reaction. The common step in fluorometabolite biosynthetic pathways
  is shaded in orange. The canonical fluoroacetate and 4-fluoro-l-threonine biosynthetic
  pathway are show in purple. The 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxy-d-ribose biosynthetic route is
  indicated in light blue. Compound abbreviations (blue): 5′-ClDA, 5′-chloro-5′-deoxyadenosine;
  SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; 5′-FDA, 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxyadenosine; 5-FDRP, 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxy-d-ribose
  1-phosphate; 5-FDRulP, 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-d-ribulose 1-phosphate; FAld, fluoroacetaldehyde;
  FAc, fluoroacetate; 4-FT, 4-fluoro-l-threonine; 5-FDR, 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxy-d-ribose;
  5-FHPA, 5-fluoro-2,3,4-trihydroxypentanoic acid. Enzyme abbreviations (black bold):
  FlA, fluorinase; FlB, 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxyadenosine phosphorylase; FlIso, 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-d-ribose
  1-phosphate isomerase; FlFT, 4-fluoro-l-threonine transaldolase; FdrA, 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-d-ribose
  1-phosphate phosphoesterase; and FdrC, 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-d-ribose dehydrogenase.'
