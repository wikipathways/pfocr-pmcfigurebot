figure_title: Eicosanoid levels at baseline (BL) and reaction (Rxn) were correlated
  with symptoms (Sx) during aspirin desensitization.
caption: Eicosanoid levels at baseline (BL) and reaction (Rxn) were correlated with
  symptoms (Sx) during aspirin desensitization. Spearman correlations between lipid
  mediators and clinical scores were calculated at BL and Rxn. A-D, Heatmaps of these
  correlations separated based on metabolic pathway. E-G, Linear regressions of significant
  correlations. ACT, Asthma Control Test; Max, maximum; ND, not detected; oxoETE,
  oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid; SNOT-22, 22-Item Sino-nasal Outcome Test; 9-oxoODE, 9-oxo-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic
