caption: The PPIase activity of CypB affects lipid metabolism via the XBP1s pathway.
  After initiating adipogenesis and waiting for seven days, 3T3-L1 cells that had
  reached full confluence were analyzed using Western blot to assess the levels of
  GRP78, IRE1α-XBP1s, and key lipogenic indicators such as XBP1s, SREBP-1, ACC, and
  FAS. The protein band intensities were measured with ImageJ software and normalized
  against β-actin expression. The results are shown as the average ± standard deviation
  from six individual experiments
