caption: Manner of post-translational modifications in modulating TGF-β/Smad signaling
  during chronic kidney disease. The figure depicts the key enzymes involved in these
  modification processes and their respective substrates, which are crucial proteins
  in the TGF-β/Smad pathway. TGF, transforming growth factor; TGF-βR, TGF-β receptor;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; TCPTP, T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase; PPM1A, protein
  phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A; Smurf, Smad ubiquitin regulatory factors; NEDD4-2,
  neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 4-2; USP, ubiquitin-specific
  protease; SENP2, SUMO specific peptidase 2; SIRT, sirtuin deacetylase; EGFR, epidermal
  growth factor receptor
