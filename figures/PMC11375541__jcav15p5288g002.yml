  in CC cells.
caption: 'Necroptosis up-regulates VEGFA via the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway in CC
  cells. (A) The result from GO enrichment analysis of NRGs. (B) The result from KEGG
  analysis of NRGs. C-E RT-qPCR results indicated the up-regulation of JAK2 (C), STAT3
  (D) and VEGFA (E) respectively with the induction of necroptosis. “SiHa-NC” means
  normal control, “SiHa-Necro” means treated with necroptosis inducer at a concentration
  of 20 μm (p-Value: **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, * p <0.05). (F) Results of the
  WB assay showed an elevated protein level of JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3 and VEGFA with
  the induction of necroptosis. “NC” means normal control, “Necro” means treated with
  necroptosis inducer at a concentration of 20 μm. (G) Results of the WB assay showed
  a decreased protein level of JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3, VEGFA and MLKL with the treatment
  of a necroptosis inhibitor NSA. “NC” means normal control, “NSA” means treated with
  NSA. (H) Results of the WB assay indicated the up-regulation of JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3
  and VEGFA was eliminated by the specific inhibitor of JAK2-STAT3 pathway FLLL32.
  I-K RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the induction of necroptosis led to an increase
  in the expression levels of JAK2 (I), STAT3 (J), and VEGFA (K), which were subsequently
  normalized upon the introduction of FLLL32. “SiHa-NC” means normal control, “SiHa-Necro”
  means treated with necroptosis inducer at a concentration of 20 μm, “SiHa-Necro-Flll32”
  means treated with necroptosis inducer (20 μm) and FLLL32 (10 μm) (p-Value: ****
  p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01)'
