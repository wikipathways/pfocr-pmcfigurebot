caption: Potential signaling pathways triggered in WCB cells by maternal OSA. Pathway
  analysis indicated that five pathways corresponded to upregulated transcripts. The
  most enriched network was “response to oxidative stress”, comprising four target
  genes. The intensity of the blue color corresponds to the fold change; the higher
  the intensity, the higher the value. The size of the circle depends on the number
  of genes associated with each network
