caption: Graphical summary of the mechanisms of action of microRNAs and lncRNAs in
  renal fibrosis. NcRNAs with beneficial effects are colored in green, while those
  related to disease progression that could serve as therapeutic targets are colored
  in red. (A) MiR-29b has been found to inhibit renal fibrosis through its effect
  on the PI3A/AKT pathway, thus interfering with EMT, as observed through its similar
  effects to PI3K inhibitor LY294002. (B) MiR-122a, found in bone MSC-Exos, reduces
  autophagy and ameliorates renal fibrosis through inhibition of the mTOR signaling
  pathway. (C) Bone marrow MSC-Exos contain miR-21-5p, which reduces the glycolysis
  rate and slows down TEC proliferation. (D) MiR-26a-5p inhibits TGF-β1, which reduces
  EMT as well. (E) lncRNA CRNDE is associated with EMT progression as it targets miR-29a-3p
