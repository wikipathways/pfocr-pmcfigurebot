caption: 'Effects of xanol on the AKT signaling pathway in human OSCC cells. (A,B)
  Human OSCC cells were treated with xanol for 24 h at 1–10 μM concentrations, and
  p-PI3K (Tyr458), PI3K, p-AKT (Ser473), and AKT (A) and p-mTOR (Ser2481), mTOR, p-p70S6K
  (Thr421/Ser424), and p70S6K (B) were analyzed by western blotting. (C,D) p-AKT (red
  color) levels were observed using an immunofluorescence assay. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
  (DAPI, blue color) was used to detect the nuclei of human OSCC cells (C). pAKT intensity
  is shown as a bar graph. Red symbol: n number. Dotted line: mean value (D). Data
  are representative of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was
  set at p < 0.05 * and data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5'
