figure_title: Schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism and intervention strategies
  of the IL-27/Blimp-1 axis in regulating Tim-3 expression on Tregs
caption: (A) Blimp-1 is expressed highest in the first trimester of pregnancy and
  is closely associated with Tim-3 expression. (B) IL-27 increases the expression
  of Tim-3 and Blimp-1 via the STAT1 signaling pathway. (Câ€“F) Blimp-1 overexpression
  promotes the coexpression of Tim-3, Tigit, and PD-1 on Tregs; increases IL-10 secretion;
  inhibits effector T cell proliferation; and promotes macrophage polarization toward
  M2 type. (G) Transfer of TregsBlimp-1 improves pregnancy outcomes in an abortion-prone
  mouse model
