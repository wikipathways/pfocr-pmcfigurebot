caption: The antioxidant mechanism of estrodiol. (1) Estradiol binds to G-protein-coupled
  receptor 30 on the cell membrane. (2) GPR30 activation by estradiol elicited the
  SRC/EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (3) The activation of the GPR30/SRC/EGFR/PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway leads to Nrf2 dissociation from Keap1. (4) Nrf2 translocates into
  the nucleus. Then the heterodimerization of NRF2 with small Maf proteins in AREs
  occurs and activates transcription of SOD, CAT, HO-1, GPxs, and so on. (5) Insufficient
  estrogen during perimenopause results in KEAP1-recruited CUL3, RBX, and NRF2 to
  degrade NRF2 through ubiquitination and ultimately leads to the decrease in antioxidant
  substances, while the increase in ROS leads to increased levels of oxidative stress
  and nerve damage in perimenopausal women
