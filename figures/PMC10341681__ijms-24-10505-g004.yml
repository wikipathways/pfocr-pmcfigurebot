caption: The signaling pathways and targets of saponins against neuroinflammation
  in AD. (1). Theasaponin E1, CK, PGS, and AS-IV, regulate targets of NF-κB signaling
  pathway; (2). Dioscin, regulates targets of RAGE/NOX4 signaling pathway; (3). Platycodigenin,
  regulates targets of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways; (4). Ginsenoside Rg5, regulates
  targets of MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways; (5). PLD, regulates targets of
  TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway; (6). NTR2, regulates targets of miR-27a/SOX8/β-catenin
  signaling pathways; (7). BF, AS-IV, Ginsenoside Rg1, Timosaponin BII, ginsenoside
  Rb1, and PF11, regulate various inflammatory factors, such as IL-16, IL-1β, etc.;
  (8). Ginsenosides Rd and hyo, enhance the expression of many anti-inflammatory factors,
  such as IL-10 and Hsp70, in addition to reducing inflammatory factors. The above
  saponins suppress neuroinflammation in AD through regulating targets of these signaling
  pathways
