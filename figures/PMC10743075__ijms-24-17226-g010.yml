caption: n-3-PUFA administration decreased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  as documented in the TNF signaling pathway. KEGG pathway map of the TNF-α signaling
  pathway. n-3-PUFA supplementation decreased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1β), as well as genes responsible for leukocyte recruitment, surface
  receptors, intercellular signaling (Bcl3), and transcription factors (Jun); MP vs.
