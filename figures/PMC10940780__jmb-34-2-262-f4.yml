figure_title: Effects of GSD on the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways in LPS-induced
  RAW264.7 cells
caption: Cells were pretreated with GSD and induced with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 1 h. The
  protein expression levels of p50 (A), p-p65 (B), and p65 were measured by western
  blotting from total cell lysates. Significance was determined versus samples untreated
  (#p < 0.01) or sample only-treated cells (*p < 0.01)
