caption: MetaCore pathway analysis of Schlafen 5 (SLFN5) co-expressed genes in COAD
  patients from TCGA. (A) The MetaCore pathway enrichment analysis was conducted for
  genes co-expressed with SLFN5 in COAD patients, revealing potential pathways involving
  these genes ranked by their log p values. (B) The "Immune response_IFN-alpha/beta
  signaling via JAK/STAT" is highlighted, with symbols representing proteins and arrows
  indicating protein interactions (green for activation and red for inhibition). Thermometer-like
  histograms visually represent microarray gene expressions, with blue indicating
  downregulation and red indicating upregulation
