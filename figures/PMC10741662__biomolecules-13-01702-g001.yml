caption: WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. In the absence of WNT signaling, β-catenin
  forms complexes with several other proteins in the cytoplasm, including APC, Axin,
  CK, and GSK-3β, leading to the compound phosphorylation and degradation of free
  β-catenin in the cytoplasm. In the presence of WNT signaling, WNT can bind to the
  FZ/LRP5/6 complex and recruit Axin to phosphorylated Dsh. This behavior can inhibit
  GSK3 activity and prevent the degradation of β-catenin by the APC/Axin/GSK-3β complex,
  thereby increasing free β-catenin in the cytoplasm. B-catenin translocates to the
  nucleus through nuclear pores and forms complexes with TCF/LEF to activate downstream
  target gene transcription, thereby promoting cell proliferation. The primary regulators
  of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway are DKK, SFRP, and APCDD1. DKK belongs to
  a family of secreted WNT inhibitors that attenuate WNT/β-catenin signaling by binding
  to and internalizing LRP5/6 coreceptors on the cell surface. The SFRP family can
  combine with the FZ receptor or WNT ligands, enable antagonism or excitement, and
  adjust the WNT signaling pathway. APCDD1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein in HFs.
  APCDD1 decreases WNT signaling by binding to both LRP5 and WNT3a
