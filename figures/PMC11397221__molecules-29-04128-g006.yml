caption: Metabolic pathways and metabolic pathway schematic diagram were significantly
  altered in skeletal muscles of mice based on the KEGG database. (A) Ex + TMAO vs.
  Ex; (B) Ex vs. Con; (C) Ex + TMAO vs. TMAO; (D) metabolic pathway schematic diagram.
  (1) alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; (2) D-Glutamine and D-glutamate
  metabolism; (3) taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; (4) glutathione metabolism;
  (5) histidine metabolism; (6) nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; (7) glycine,
  serine and threonine metabolism; (8) phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis;
  (9) phenylalanine metabolism; (10) glycerolipid metabolism
