figure_title: Bubble map of KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment.
caption: 'Bubble map of KEGG metabolic pathway enrichment. The horizontal coordinate
  represents the enrichment significance (p-value), and the vertical coordinate represents
  the KEGG pathway. The size of the bubbles indicates the number of metabolites enriched
  in each pathway. The size of each bubble indicates the number of metabolites enriched
  in each pathway. (A) PL24 vs. Ck24, (B) PL48 vs. CK48, (C) PL72 vs. CK72. PL: pulsed
  light, CK: control'
