caption: Cellular and metabolic changes in adipocytes during infections. (A) Ad36
  regulates the activation of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by the recruitment
  of P13K to the membrane, PI3K-AKT leads to cellular glucose uptake by the glucose
  transporter Glut4 and could induce the de novo synthesis of fatty acids despite
  the down-regulation of the Insulin Receptor. Moreover, the inhibition of Leptin
  may increase lipid accumulation and the prevalence of obesity. (B) HIV proteins
  Vpr, Tat, and Nef participate as repressors of PPAR-γ and its target, such as GLUT4,
  besides Vpr expression, thus accelerating lipolysis and insulin resistance as well
  as preventing the maturation of adipocytes. (C) Mycobacterium tuberculosis can use
  adipose tissue as a reservoir and as macrophages, inducing lipogenic metabolism
  that can accumulate lipids (foam macrophages). Furthermore, adipocytes regulate
  inflammation by reducing oxidative stress in a decreased iron uptake manner, but
  augmenting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit cells similar
  to macrophages. Additionally, the synthesis of triacylglycerol and lipase is increased
  to dispose of free fatty acids. (D) Chlamydia ssp infection increases the unfolded
  protein response and the guides to ROS production and Ca++ release; this could lead
  to FABP4 activity in adipocytes. Moreover, the expression of adipogenic markers
  is accompanied by lipid droplet accumulation, suggesting their transformation into
  differentiated adipocytes. (E) Trypanosoma cruzi infection dysregulates some proteins
  in the adipocyte, reducing adiponectin and PPAR- γ, but also signal molecules that
  stimulate inflammation such as Toll-like receptors (TLR-2 and -9). Additionally,
  cultured adipocytes presented a higher activation of the MAPK pathway in cultured
  adipocytes. Cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ) and chemokines (CCL2-CCL8 and CCL12),
  as well as the levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10, were markedly elevated in the adipose
  tissue of acutely infected mice. (F) Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoites use the adipose
  tissue as reservoirs; the infection with T gondii can induce oxidative stress and
  the subsequent inflammatory response. In addition, several cytokines, such as IL-2,
  could affect the adipocyte tissue and alter their metabolism or promote cell proliferation
  and hypertrophy as well the presence of Interferon-gamma and adiponectin chemerin
  in the serum, thus encouraging the development of the metabolic syndrome.
