caption: Apocynin altered the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
  signaling pathways in HMC-3 cells following exposure to cigarette smoke extract
  conditioned media from BEAS-2B cells. (A) Representative image of protein expression
  of phosphorylated and total c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK1/2), and p38 in HMC3 cells. (B) Phospho-JNK; (C) Phospho-ERK1/2, (n
  = 6 per group). Data are expressed as mean + SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ****
  p < 0.0001
