  inflammation.
caption: Network pharmacological analysis of XYS in the treatment of depression inflammation.
  (a) Venn diagram of overlapping targets. (b) Intersection target PPI viewable. The
  higher the degree of the node, the darker the node will be. The thickness of the
  edges is related to the combined score. (c) Top 10 key targets in terms of degree.
  (d) The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the potential targets. (e) GO terms
  enrichment analysis. (f) The disease-ingredients-target network map, with disease
  names labeled in green, intersecting targets labeled in purple, drugs labeled in
  light blue, and chemical components labeled in pink
