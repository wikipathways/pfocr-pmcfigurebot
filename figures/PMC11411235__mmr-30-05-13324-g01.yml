figure_title: Functions of tetraspanins in GC.
caption: 'Functions of tetraspanins in GC. (A) Tetraspanins promoting GC progression:
  (a) Downregulation of TSPAN4 reduces GC cell proliferation. (b) In GC cells, TSPAN24/CD151
  expression is positively associated with GC invasiveness due to the formation of
  a complex with integrin α3. PVT-1 increases TSPAN24 expression and inhibits miR-152
  expression, promoting gastric carcinogenesis. (c) TSPAN1 enhances cell growth and
  infiltration in GC. miR-573 binds to the 3′UTR of TSPAN1, leading to cell cycle
  arrest in the G1/G0 phase and suppression of GC growth and infiltration. (d) TSPAN8
  enhances GC cell growth and migration by activating the EGFR pathway. (e) Co-expression
  of TSPAN29/CD9 and proHB-EGF may be involved in gastric carcinogenesis. LSD1 upregulates
  TSPAN29/CD9 by decreasing miR-142-5p levels, promoting GC migration. (f) TSPAN31
  enhances the growth and movement of GC cells by suppressing cell death when METTL1
  and CCT2 are co-expressed. (B) Tetraspanins suppressing GC progression: (a) Aberrant
  CpG hypermethylation of the TSPAN28/CD81 promoter reduces mRNA expression and impairs
  the ability of GC cells to form colonies. (b) TSPAN27/CD82 suppresses GC invasion
  by suppressing the activation of ERK1/2, EGFR and MMP7. (c) TSPAN5 inhibits GC cell
  proliferation, migration and colony formation by regulating the G1 to S phase transition.
  (d) TSPAN9 inhibits the ERK1/2 pathway, leading to downregulation of MMP-9 and uPA.
  The extracellular secretory protein, EMILIN1, inhibits the FAK-RAS-ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway, resulting in increased TSPAN9 expression and inhibition of GC cell migration
  and invasion. TSPAN9 also interacts with PI3K to block PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling,
  enhancing autophagy. (e) TSPAN21 inhibits MMP7, controlling cell metastasis, invasion
  and survival. GC, gastric cancer; TSPAN, tetraspanin; PVT-1, plasmacytoma variant
