  IL-2: (A) Activation of the IL-15 receptor signaling pathway in NK-92/hu14.'
caption: 'Proliferation of RD-IL15-expressing CAR-NK cells in the absence of IL-2:
  (A) Activation of the IL-15 receptor signaling pathway in NK-92/hu14.18.28.z_RD-IL15
  cells. Lysates of NK-92/hu14.18.28.z_RD-IL15 or parental NK-92 cells cultured for
  24 h in medium with or without IL-2 were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions
  and subsequent immunoblotting with antibodies specific for total and phosphorylated
  STAT5. γ-Tubulin served as a loading control. Original blots can be found in Figure
  S6. (B) Self-enrichment of RD-IL15-expressing CAR-NK cells over time was assessed
  by flow cytometric analysis of the proportion of EGFP-positive cells in cultures
  of NK-92 cells transduced with lentiviral vector S-hu14.18.28.z_RD-IL15 and then
  kept in medium lacking IL-2. (C) Proliferation and viability of NK-92/hu14.18.28.z
  and NK-92/hu14.18.28.z_RD-IL15 cells grown for 7 days in the presence (filled symbols)
  or absence of IL-2 (open symbols). Cell density and proportion of viable cells were
  determined on days 0, 1, 4, and 7. Mean values ± SD are shown; n = 3; **, p < 0.01;
  *, p < 0.05'
