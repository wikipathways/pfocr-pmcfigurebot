caption: BAP1 suppresses the ERK signaling pathway. (A, B) MSCs transfected with 20
  nM siNon or siBAP1 were harvested for immunoblot analysis. (C) The levels of mRNA
  were determined using qRT-PCR. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from three independent
  experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test (ns = non-significant,
  *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01)
