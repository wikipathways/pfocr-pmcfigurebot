caption: Mechanisms of itch and KOR itch-neuromodulation. A, Pruritogenic signals
  originate from various cell types, such as macrophages, keratinocytes, mast cells,
  and T cells. Various receptors participate in itch neurotransmission, including
  TNFR, RTK, 5-HTR, PAR2, H1 receptor, TRPV1, OSMR, and IL-31RA. The KOR is located
  downstream of these receptors and can block itch neurotransmission signals. B, Itch
  signals originating within the skin travel to spinal interneurons through sensory
  afferent neurons. Projection neurons receive signals from spinal interneurons and
  transmit pain and itch-relevant information to the brain. C, Activation of the KOR
  attenuates GRPR-mediated itch signaling through the KOR-PLC-PKCd-GRPR signaling
  pathway. Figure made using BioRender. GRPR indicates gastrin-releasing peptide receptor;
  H1, histamine 1; 5-HTR, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor; IL-31RA, interleukin-31 receptor
  alpha; KOR, kappa opioid receptor; OSMR, oncostatin M receptor; PAR2, protease-activated
  receptor 2; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor;
  TRPV1, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1
