figure_title: Expression levels of insulin signaling pathway and mTOR pathway indicators
  after silencing of DDIT4 in C2C12 cells with PA-induced insulin resistance.
caption: 'Expression levels of insulin signaling pathway and mTOR pathway indicators
  after silencing of DDIT4 in C2C12 cells with PA-induced insulin resistance. (A)
  Protein expression levels of DDIT4 were decreased after transfection with three
  DDIT4-siRNAs. (B) Glucose concentration in the culture medium of C2C12 cells was
  increased after silencing DDIT4. (C) Number of red lipid droplets in C2C12 cells
  was increased after silencing DDIT4, as determined by Oil red O staining; magnification,
  ×400, scale bar, 100 µm. (D) TG levels in C2C12 cells were increased after silencing
  DDIT4. (E) mRNA expression levels of DDIT4 were decreased after silencing DDIT4.
  (F) Protein expression levels of DDIT4 and mTOR pathway indicators after silencing
  DDIT4. (G) Semi-quantification of p-protein/t-protein ratios for mTOR pathway indicators
  and protein expression levels of DDIT4 after silencing DDIT4. (H) Protein expression
  levels of insulin signaling pathway indicators after silencing of DDIT4. (I) Semi-quantification
  of p-protein/t-protein ratios for insulin signaling pathway indicators and protein
  expression levels of GLUT4 after silencing of DDIT4. All cells were treated with
  100 nM insulin for 30 min before (B) detection of glucose contents and (A, F and
  H) western blotting. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05 vs. CON,
  #P<0.05 vs. PA, &P<0.05 vs. PA + RSV. CON, control; RSV, resveratrol; PA, palmitic
  acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NC, negative control; DDIT4, DNA damage-inducible
  transcript 4; p70S6K, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1;
  GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; p-, phosphorylated; t-t, total; TG, triglyceride'
