figure_title: ascr#10 promotes germline proliferation in hermaphrodites via LAG-2/GLP-1
  signaling
caption: (A) Schematic depiction of the distal germline. The distal tip cell (DTC)
  is shown in red, germline cells are blue, and pH3+ cells are magenta. The dashed
  line denotes the boundary of the transition zone. A simplified LAG-2/GLP-1 signaling
  pathway is shown below. (B) GPC counts with or without exposure to ascr#10. Wild
  type, hop-1, lst-1, and sygl-1 were scored on Day 2 of adulthood. lag-2 and glp-1
  strains were shifted to non-permissive temperature as young adults and counted at
  the time equivalent to Day 2 of adulthood. Each dot represents a single gonad arm.
  Black bars are means. (C) Counts of pH3+ cells with or without exposure to ascr#10.
  Worms were treated and scored as in panel B. Error bars are standard deviation.
  (D) A representative image of DTC expression of plag-2::mCherry; quantification
  shown below. Each triangle is the measurement of one DTC; black bars denote means.
  Scale bar = 20μm. * p<0.05, *** p<0.001, **** p<0.0001. Additional data in Figure
  S1. See Table S1 for sample sizes and statistical analyses
