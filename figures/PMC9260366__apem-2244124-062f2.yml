caption: Backdoor pathway of androgen biosynthesis. The backdoor route is similar
  to the classic route presented in , except for the sequential 5α- and 3α-reduction
  of 17OH-progesterone, first by 5αRed1 to 17OH-dihydroprogesterone, and then 3α-reduction
  by AKR1C2 or AKR1C4 to produce 17OH-allopregnanolone. P450c17 can catalyze 17, 20
  lyase activity using 17OH-allopregnanolone as the substrate; this reaction produces
  androsterone, which can be catalyzed by testicular 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  type 3 (17βHSD3) or adrenal 17βHSD5 (AKR1C3) to produce androstanediol. Androstanediol
  may then undergo 3α-oxidization, probably mediated by 17βHSD6 (also called retinol
  dehydrogenase, RoDH), to produce the most active androgen, DHT. StAR, steroidogenic
  acute regulatory protein; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; DHT, dihydrotestosterone;
  AKR, aldo-ketoreductase.
