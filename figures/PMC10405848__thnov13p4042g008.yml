figure_title: Combined administration of TLR4 and PTK2 inhibitors suppresses KLF7-mediated
  HCC development and metastasis.
caption: Combined administration of TLR4 and PTK2 inhibitors suppresses KLF7-mediated
  HCC development and metastasis. (A) PLC/PRF/5-KLF7 cells were incubated with vehicle,
  TAK-242, defactinib, or a combination of both, then the protein levels of HMGB1,
  KLF7, TLR4, p-p65, p65, p-PTK2 and PTK2 were detected. (B) Transwell analysis of
  the mobility of PLC/PRF/5-KLF7 cells treated with TAK-242 alone, defactinib alone,
  or a combination of both. (C) The diagram of drug treatment. Nude mice were transplanted
  with HCC cells and randomly divided into four groups. Then, vehicle, TAK-242, defactinib,
  or combined administration were applied to different groups, respectively. (D-H)
  Combined blockade of TLR4 and PTK2 alleviated KLF7-mediated HCC metastasis. (D)
  Representative bioluminescent pictures of liver tumors in nude mice. (E) Intensity
  of bioluminescent signals of liver tumors. (F) Overall survival of mice. (G)The
  amount of pulmonary metastatic nodules. (H) Representative pictures of H&E staining
  of lung tissues. (I) Schematic diagram of DEN/CCl4 treatment and drug regimens.
  Mice were randomly divided into four groups at 18 weeks. Then, vehicle, TAK-242,
  defactinib, or combined application was applied to each group, respectively. (J)
  Typical images of whole-liver morphology and H&E of liver sections from different
  groups at 34 weeks. (K) 10 mice in each group were sacrificed at 34 weeks for statistical
  analysis. The analysis of liver weight/body weight ratio, tumor number, and largest
  tumor size in each group were shown (n = 10 per group). (L) 20 mice in each group
  were raised until natural death for survival analysis. The survival rates of mice
  in different groups were shown (n = 20 per group). (M) A schematic diagram depicting
  the function of the HMGB1-KLF7-TLR4/PTK2 pathway in inflammation-mediated HCC development
  and metastasis. Inflammation-provoked HMGB1 release upregulates KLF7 expression
  via the TLR4/RAGE-PI3K-AKT-NF-κB pathway within HCC cells. Furthermore, KLF7 promotes
  HCC development and metastasis by transcriptionally upregulating TLR4 and PTK2 expression,
  forming an HMGB1-KLF7-TLR4 positive feedback loop. Hepatocyte-specific knockout
  of Klf7 via AAV8 gene therapy, or combined administration of TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242
  and PTK2 inhibitor defactinib significantly impedes HCC development and metastasis
  mediated by the HMGB1-KLF7 axis. *P < 0.05
