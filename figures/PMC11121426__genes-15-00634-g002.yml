caption: Involvement of TLR4 in atrial fibrillation. KEGG Toll-like receptor signalling
  pathway with genes colour-coded based on their modulation in AF (A). UpSet plot
  showing the overlap between the AF gene signature and the TLR4 consensus signature
  (B). Venn diagram showing the overlap between the AF gene signature and the consensus
  signatures for MYD88 (C). Venn diagram showing the overlap between the AF gene signature
  and the consensus signatures for TICA; M1 (D)
