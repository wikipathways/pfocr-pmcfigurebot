figure_title: Knockdown of ETS1 attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in BEAS-2B
  cells.
caption: 'Knockdown of ETS1 attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in BEAS-2B
  cells. ETS1 levels measured by (A) RT-PCR and (B) western blot assay in BEAS-2B
  cells following transfection with siRNAs (NC, si-ETS1 #1, #2, #3). (C) Expression
  levels of key genes of ERK signalling pathway were detected by western blot and
  (D) semi-quantified. (E) IL-6 and (F) VEGF levels were measured through ELISA. *P<0.05,
  **P<0.01. ETS1, E26 transformation specific-1; NC, negative control; si, small interfering;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; p, phosphorylated'
