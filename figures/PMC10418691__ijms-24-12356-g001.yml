  substrates.
caption: Biosynthetic pathway of isoflavonoids and chemical structures of selected
  substrates. (A) Chalcone synthase (CHS) converts p-coumaroyl Co-A into naringenin
  chalcone, which is isomerized by chalcone isomerase (CHI) to produce the flavonoid
  structure (C6-C3-C6 backbone). Isoflavonoid synthase (IFS) and cytochrome P450 reductase
  (CPR) perform an aryl ring migration reaction (B-ring) to produce an isoflavonoid
  backbone from flavonoids. (B) Chemical structures of naringenin (NGN), genistein
  (GEN), biochanin-A (BCN), liquiritigenin (LQN), daidzein (DZN), and formononetin
  (FMN) are given. Glycosylation sites have been shown with the letter ‘G’ inside
  a blue (most common glycosylation sites) or a black circle (less common glycosylation
  sites)
