caption: 'The dual roles of microRNAs in MM. microRNAs have the capacity to influence
  both the expressions of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. The upregulation
  of miR-21, miR-221/222, and miR-17-92 causes the deactivation of the BIM, SOCS1,
  and IL6-JAK-STAT3 pathways, which results in the activation of the Mcl-1, Bcl-XL,
  and c-Myc oncogenes and the suppression of the activity of the p53 gene through
  the LncRNAs PTV1, MALAT1, and MEG. In other pathways, the activation of miIR145-3p
  led to increased rates of the pro-apoptotic protein BCL2L11, and the inactivation
  of mTORC1 led to activation of the autophagic flux, which in turn led to increased
  autophagy and cell death. Both effects were caused by an increase in the rate of
  autophagy. miRNA-338-3p served as a substrate for circ_000784, which in turn activated
  the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, as well as chemokines and cytokines, ultimately
  leading to the activation of hsa_circRNA_101237. Circ_0007841 revealed its oncogene
  activity via the miRNA-338-3p/BRD4 complex to boost cell proliferation and the processes
  of the cell cycle, hence bypassing the cell apoptosis and senescence pathway. Patients
  with multiple myeloma had significantly decreased levels of circ-MYBL2 expression
  in both bone marrow and serum, which is indicative of a poor prognosis owing to
  the advanced clinical stage of their disease and other variables. However, treatment
  with exogenous circ-MYBL2 resulted in a significant increase in the rate at which
  MM cells succumbed, as well as improved DNA synthesis and machinery for proliferation.
  Overexpression of miR-155 led to a dose- and time-dependent increase in drug-resistant
  multiple myeloma cells’ sensitivity to the anticancer drug bortezomib. In addition,
  the levels of miR-125a, miR-21, miR-221/222, miR-451, and miR-155 are increased
  in MM cells, which boosts the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and survival rate,
  as well as the likelihood of developing resistance to anti-myeloma therapy. miR:
