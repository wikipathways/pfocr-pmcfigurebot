caption: Analysis of SEC2/ST-4-induced apoptotic pathway in blebbistatin-treated stiffer
  ovarian cancer cells. (A–H) SEC2/ST-4 treatment of blebbistatin-treated stiffer
  SKOV3 and ES-2 cells activate apoptosis-related protein caspase 3, 8 and 9. After
  being co-cultured in transwell for 72 h. Blebbistatin-treated stiffer SKOV3 and
  ES-2 cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer at 4 °C for 10 min to extract
  cellular protein. Cleaved caspase 3, 8, and 9 protein levels were detected by Western
  blot analysis. Each value indicates the mean ± SD of results obtained from three
  independent experiments. * p < 0.05
