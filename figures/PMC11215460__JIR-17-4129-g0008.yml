caption: 'Rosiglitazone upregulates PKP2 and affects endothelial cell leakage. (A)
  Western blot analysis revealed that rosiglitazone markedly increased the expression
  levels of PKP2, p-p38/p38, and claudin1 proteins in HUVECs stimulated with LPS (data
  represent the results of three independent experiments). (B) Rosiglitazone significantly
  enhanced the mRNA expression of AQP3 and occludin in HUVECs stimulated with LPS
  (data represent the results of three independent experiments). (C) Following LPS
  stimulation, rosiglitazone significantly increased the protein expression of β-catenin
  and claudin1 in HUVECs with PKP2 knockdown (representative of three independent
  experiments). (D) Following LPS stimulation, the degree of porosity of the cytoskeleton
  in HUVECs with PKP2 knockdown was significantly improved by rosiglitazone (data
  represent the results of three independent experiments). (E) Rosiglitazone significantly
  decreased the permeability of HUVECs stimulated with LPS (data represent the results
  of three independent experiments). (F) Rosiglitazone significantly reduced the permeability
  of HUVECs with PKP2 knockdown upon LPS stimulation (data represent the results of
  three independent experiments). Rosiglitazone: agonist of PPARγ. *p < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p <0.0001.'
