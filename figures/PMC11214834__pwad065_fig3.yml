caption: 'Glutamine inhibits GC apoptosis via ASK1 apoptotic signaling pathway. (A)
  Glutamine starvation specifically induces apoptosis of mice granulosa cells. Primary
  mouse TCs and GCs were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium and then changed to a glutamine-free
  1640 medium. Cell apoptotic ratios were measured at the indicated time points using
  flow cytometry (n = 3). (B) Glutamine starvation induces apoptosis in granulosa
  cells. Flow cytometry analysis (n = 3) of the apoptotic ratio of granulosa cells
  at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after glutamine deprivation in COV434 cells. (C–H)
  Glutamine deprivation induces GC apoptosis by activating ASK1 signaling. ASK1 and
  its downstream molecular pathways, JNK and P38, were activated during glutamine
  deprivation in a time-dependent manner (C), and inhibited by glutamine supplementation
  (D), as well as in the FF floating cells of PCOS patients (E). ASK1 knockdown reversed
  apoptotic signaling induced by glutamine deficiency (F), whereas overexpression
  of ASK1 promoted apoptotic signaling in COV434 cells (G and H). (I) JNK activation
  in mice follicles. Immunofluorescence staining of p-JNK (red) and cleaved Caspase-3
  (green) with DAPI (blue) in mouse ovaries. Scale bar: 50 μm. (J–M) Fas-signaling
  rather than TNFR signaling mediates granulosa cell apoptosis. Inhibition of Fas
  signaling by KR33493, but not TNF-α signaling by R7050, attenuates JNK and P38 phosphorylation
  (J) and apoptosis (K) induced by glutamine deprivation. Consistent with this, Fas-knockdown,
  but not TNFR-knockdown, COV434 cells inhibited JNK and P38 phosphorylation (L) and
  resistance to apoptosis (M) induced by glutamine deprivation (n = 3).'
