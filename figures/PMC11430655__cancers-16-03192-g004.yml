figure_title: Graph representing the interaction network of Diaph1 with proteins involved
  in cytoskeletal dynamics.
caption: 'Graph representing the interaction network of Diaph1 with proteins involved
  in cytoskeletal dynamics. Formin, Diaph1, is responsible for the polymerization
  and depolymerization of actin. It interacts with PFN1 and CFL1. Interactions between
  these molecules engage RhoA to interact with RAGE. Moreover, the cross-talk between
  RAGE and Diaph1 may play a crucial role in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton
  during the progression of EC. AGER (the gene encoding RAGE), Diaph1, PFN1, CFL1,
  and RhoA are connected in one network. The network consists of 25 genes (official
  symbol). STAT6 belongs to the STAT family. The STAT pathway may be dependent on
  the proper function of the actin cytoskeleton. The server additionally adds genes
  based on known interactions. Additional genes are represented by gray, unstriped
  circles (https://genemania.org/) [24]. The colors of the line suggest the type of
  interaction, that is, red—physical interactions; purple—co-expression; orange—predicted;
  blue—co-localization; light blue—pathway; green—genetic interactions; olive—shared
  protein domains. Limited to Homo sapiens. Abbreviations: S100A12—S100 calcium-binding
  protein A12; AGER—the gene encoding RAGE; S100B—S100 calcium-binding protein B;
  Diaph1—diaphanous-related formin 1; Diaph2—diaphanous-related formin 2; PFN1—profilin
  1; PFN3—profilin 3; PFN2—profilin 2; HMGB1—high-mobility group box 1; ERBB4—Erb-b2
  receptor tyrosine kinase 4; RELA—RELA proto-oncogene, NFKB subunit; STAT6—signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 6; RTKN—rhotekin; RHOA—ras homolog family
  member A; PKD2—polycystin 2; SSH2—slingshot protein phosphatase 2; CFL1—cofilin
  1; ACTB—actin beta; SSH1—slingshot protein phosphatase 1; RHOC—ras homolog family
  member C; SSH3—slingshot protein phosphatase 3; VASP—vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein;
  LIMK1—LIM domain kinase 1; ACTA1—actin alpha 1; DAAM1—dishevelled associated activator
  of morphogenesis 1. N/A—not applicable. See File S3. The interaction network using
  GeneMANIA was created in the publication by Zglejc-Waszak et al. [8]. These are
  not the same interaction networks as in the previous publication [8]. The similarity
  may result from the databases used by the GeneMANIA server'
