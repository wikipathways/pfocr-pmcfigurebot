caption: The inhibition of apoptosis signaling pathways by selenomethionine. (A) Selenomethionine
  inhibits HAdV-7-induced apoptosis through the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway mediated
  by ROS. The concentrations of selenomethionine were 32 Î¼M. (B) A diagram of the
  mechanism by which selenomethionine exhibits anti-HAdV-7 activity by modulating
  apoptotic signaling pathways
