figure_title: CircRILPL1 inhibits the LATS1-YAP kinase cascade by binding to ROCK1
caption: 'A The proteins pulled-down by circRILPL1 were separated by the SDS-PAGE,
  followed by silver staining and identification by LC-MS/MS. Biotin: biotinylated
  probe targeting the circRILPL1 back-spliced site; Un-biotin: unbiotinylated probe,
  as control. Bands corresponding to ROCK1 (158 kDa) and IPO7 (119 kDa) were marked.
  B The interaction between circRILPL1 and ROCK1 protein was detected in NPC cells
  using RNA pull-down assay with a biotin-labeled circRILPL1 probe. GAPDH was used
  as a negative control. C The interaction between circRILPL1 and ROCK1 protein was
  detected in NPC cells by RIP assay using anti-ROCK1 antibody. The fold enrichment
  of circRILPL1 was relative to that of the control IgG. Data were presented as the
  means ± SD. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. D The co-localization between
  circRILPL1 and ROCK1 protein was detected by IF-FISH. DAPI: blue; ROCK1: green;
  CircRILPL1: red; Scale bar = 20 μm. E The effects of circRILPL1 on MYPT1 (Thr696)
  phosphorylation and ROCK1 protein were measured by western blotting in NPC cells
  after overexpression or knockdown of circRILPL1. F. The expressions of p-MYPT1 (Thr696),
  ROCK1, p-YAP (Ser127 and Ser397), YAP, p-LATS1, and LATS1 were measured in the circRILPL1
  overexpressed NPC cells treated with the ROCK1 inhibitor Y27632 (10 uM) for 2 h
  by western blotting. G The expressions of p-MYPT1 (Thr696), ROCK1, p-YAP (Ser127
  and Ser397), YAP, p-LATS1, and LATS1 were measured in NPC cells after co-transfection
  of the circRILPL1 overexpression plasmid and ROCK1 siRNA by western blotting.'
