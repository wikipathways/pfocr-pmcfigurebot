caption: Gut microbiome composition and functional analyses. (A) Cladogram indicating
  the phylogenetic distribution of the microbiota in the AONFH and NC groups. (B)
  Linear discriminant analysis integrated with effect size demonstrated differences
  in abundance between the AONFH and NC groups. (C) Predicted functions of the gut
  microbiota based on KEGG pathway analysis. The extended error bar plot demonstrated
  the significantly different KEGG pathways between the AONFH and NC groups. AONFH,
  alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head; NC, negative control; KEGG, Kyoto
