figure_title: Consistent GPR19 energy-DNA management molecular signatures also occur
  in divergent protein extraction compartments.
caption: 'Consistent GPR19 energy-DNA management molecular signatures also occur in
  divergent protein extraction compartments. Separating GPR19 perturbagen datasets
  into cytoplasmic (solid line, (A−C), plasma membrane (dotted line, (D–F) or nuclear/organelle
  (dashed line, G–I), a commonly found core of proteins was identified (found at all
  levels of GPR19 perturbation) that when subjected to either KEGG (B,E,H) or Reactome
  (C,F,I) pathway analysis was again able to represent a pathway-based impression
  of energy and DNA integrity management. The associated heatmap key indicates the
  range of log2 transformed GPR19: mock expression ratios'
