figure_title: Depiction of NADPH’s Roles in Cellular Metabolism.
caption: Depiction of NADPH’s Roles in Cellular Metabolism. NADPH is shown as a key
  coenzyme in cellular processes, primarily in ROS scavenging by transforming and
  detoxifying O2− and H2O2 and in ROS production via NADPH oxidases. It also plays
  a crucial role in biosynthesis, aiding in fatty acid elongation and cholesterol
  synthesis. (A) depicts the ROS scavenging mechanisms where NADPH is utilized in
  the enzymatic reaction that regenerates GSH from its GSSG via GR. This reduced GSH
  then aids GPX in detoxifying H2O2 into water, a vital process for controlling oxidative
  stress within the cell. (B) contrasts with the antioxidative role by illustrating
  NADPH as a substrate for the NADPH oxidase complex, which catalyzes the production
  of O2−. These radicals are key signaling molecules that activate various kinases
  such as JNK, P38, IKK, and PKCδ, thereby implicating NADPH in the modulation of
  cellular stress responses. (C) transitions into the realm of lipid metabolism, detailing
  NADPH’s essential function in the synthesis of fatty acids. It traces the metabolic
  flow from glucose to pyruvate, then to acetyl-CoA, and its subsequent carboxylation
  to malonyl-CoA, followed by elongation to palmitoyl-CoA via fatty acid synthase
  (Fas), a process reliant on NADPH. The series of reactions leading to the formation
  of triacylglycerol accentuates the role of NADPH as a reducing agent in the biosynthesis
  of complex lipids. P represents a phosphate group. (D) outlines the cholesterol
  synthesis pathway, where NADPH again plays a crucial role as a reducing agent, particularly
  in the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase. The pathway is
  further detailed through subsequent conversions to intermediate compounds like isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate, culminating in the production of cholesterol,
  underscoring the significance of NADPH in the synthesis of this vital lipid molecule.
