  through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
caption: 'C2CD4B promotes endothelial dysfunction of mice mesenteric arteries through
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (A,B) Representative western blot and densitometric
  analyses of three independent experiments evaluating protein levels of (A) phospho–PI3K
  and (B) phospho–Akt protein expression in HUVECs treated with vehicle (ctrl), or
  recombinant C2CD4B. (C) NADPH–induced lucigenin chemiluminescence (data are expressed
  as increase in chemiluminescence per minute in arbitrary units) in HUVECs treated
  with 100 ng/mL of C2CD4B in the presence or absence of wortmannin, or AKT inhibitor
  X; (n = 4–5). (D) Acetylcholine (ACh)–evoked vasorelaxation in mice mesenteric arteries
  exposed to vehicle or recombinant C2CD4B in the presence or absence of wortmannin
  (n = 3). (E) NO detection by DAF-FM in mice mesenteric arteries treated with vehicle,
  C2CD4B alone, or pre-treated with wortmannin. Box plot shows relative fluorescence
  intensity; (n = 3). (F) ACh–evoked vasorelaxation in mice mesenteric arteries exposed
  to vehicle or recombinant C2CD4B in the presence or absence of AKT inhibitor X;
  (n = 3). Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-test, one-way or
  two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001; #
  p < 0.05; § p < 0.05; ### p < 0.001'
