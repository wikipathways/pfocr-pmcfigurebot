caption: Chemical inhibition of the Hippo pathway promotes growth of ATM-knockout
  hESCs and of their derived NPCs more than growth of WT cells. (A) Relative survival
  of ATM-knockout hESC clone and WT cells 6 d after treatment with increasing concentrations
  of the small molecule CGP3466B. Asterisks represent significance of t-tests between
  each data point in knockout and WT cells. The graph represents the average of 6
  biological repeats in 2 independent experiments. (** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). (B)
  Relative survival of ATM-knockout hESC clone and WT cells 24 h following treatment
  with increasing concentrations of LATSi. Asterisks represent significance of t-test
  between each data point in knockout and WT cells. X-axis is represented in a log
  scale. The graph represents the average of 9 biological repeats in 3 independent
  experiments. (*** p < 0.001). (C) Bar plot showing the relative survival of ATM-knockout
  neural progenitor cells 24 h following treatment with the indicated concentrations
  of LATSi. Each bar represents the average of 3–6 biological repeats in 1–2 independent
  experiments (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01)
