caption: ZNL-0056 selectively inhibits EGFR and its downstream signaling in H3255
  cells. (A) Dose–response curves for ZNL-0056 and osimertinib in H3255 cells following
  72 h of treatment. Cell viability was assessed with CellTiter-Glo. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM (n = 4). Representative data from three independent experiments
  are shown. (B) Immunoblot assessment of the effect of ZNL-0056 on EGFR signaling
  pathway in H3255 cells after 6 h treatment. Representative blots from two independent
  experiments are shown. (C) KiNativ profiling in H3255 cell lysates treated with
  2.5 μM of ZNL-0056 for 2 h.
