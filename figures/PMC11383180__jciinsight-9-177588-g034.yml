figure_title: ADAM17 variant inhibits hair follicle development through the Notch
  signaling pathway
caption: (A) Log2 fold-change in the normalized counts of Proteomics-Seq reads of
  differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in wild-type and Adam17D647N/D647N mice.
  (B) Heatmap of DEPs in the indicated mice, annotated for selected proteins. (C)
  DEP analysis revealed a substantial decrease of hair shaft and IRS markers in Adam17D647N/D647N
  mice. (n = 3 biological replicates.) (D) Pathway enrichment analysis of DEPs revealed
  marked upregulation of ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis pathways
  and downregulation of Notch signaling pathways. Results were expressed as mean ±
  SD; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; unpaired 2-tailed t test (C)
