figure_title: The biological functions of SUMOylation cascade in tumors.
caption: 'The biological functions of SUMOylation cascade in tumors. SUMOylation participates
  in the acquisition or maintenance of cancer hallmarks, such as tumor invasion, metastasis,
  cancer stem cell self-renewal, epigenetic reprogramming, immune evasion, metabolic
  reprogramming, and programmed cell death escape. SUMOylation is involved in tumor
  invasion and metastasis via administrating tumor angiogenesis, EMT, etc. SUMOylation
  induces cancer stem cell maintenance and self-renewal via governing cancer stemness-related
  genes and pathways. SUMOylation manages epigenetic reprogramming via perturbing
  transcriptional activation, protein interaction, protein localization, protein stability,
  and RNA metabolism. SUMOylation facilitates tumor immune evasion via altering the
  tumor microenvironment and abolishing immune surveillance. SUMOylation promotes
  metabolic reprogramming via stimulating the Warburg effect. SUMOylation enhances
  the escape of programmed cell death via blocking apoptosis and autophagy. EMT: epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition'
