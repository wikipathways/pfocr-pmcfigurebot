caption: PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70 S6K signalling is upregulated in activated myofibroblasts
  (aVICs). (A) Representative confocal images of α‐SMA (red) staining in canine aVICs
  and qVICs (two biological replicates), scale bar 20 μm. (B, D) Representative western
  blot of ECM and VIC phenotype protein expression and quantification of the relative
  protein expression (two biological replicates shown in blots, n = 6). (C, E, F)
  Representative western blot of PI3K 110α, total AKT, phosphorylated AKT (p‐AKT),
  total mTOR, phosphorylated mTOR (p‐mTOR), p70 S6K, phosphorylated p70 S6K (p‐p70
  S6K), PRSA40, phosphorylated PRSA40 (p‐PRSA40), IRS1 and phosphorylated IRS1 (p‐IRS1)
  protein expression and quantification of the relative protein expression (two biological
  replicates shown in blots, n = 6). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA followed
  by Tukey's range test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to control.
  ANOVA, analysis of variance; ECM, extracellular matrix; VIC, valve interstitial
  cell.

  and secretory phenotype of valvular interstitial cells through the modulation of
  cellular senescence in a naturally occurring in vitro canine model of myxomatous
  mitral valve disease.
