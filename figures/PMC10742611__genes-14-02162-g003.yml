figure_title: Targeting Aberrant BMP Signaling in FOP.
caption: 'Targeting Aberrant BMP Signaling in FOP. This figure illustrates the aberrant
  BMP signaling pathway in FOP, identifying specific points where therapeutic drugs
  and strategies intervene to modulate the pathway. Activin A blocking antibodies,
  e.g., garetosmab, inhibit activin A-mediated signaling. ACVR1 inhibitors, including
  fidrisertib and zilurgisertib, inhibit the activity of mutant ACVR1 receptors. Exon
  skipping, allele-specific RNAi, and preferential inducers of ACVR1mutant alleles
  target the genetic level to reduce the expression of mutant ACVR1 receptors. ACVR1
  kinase inhibitors, e.g., saracatinib, inhibit the kinase activity of the ACVR1 receptor.
  SMAD kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of SMAD disrupt the downstream signaling of
  the BMP pathway. RARÎ³-agonists, e.g., palovarotene, enhance the proteasome degradation
  of SMAD1/5/9(8) proteins. Inhibitors of mTOR, e.g., rapamycin, and inhibitors of
  osteogenic gene products affect the cellular responses to BMP signaling. Additionally,
  gene therapy and gene editing are identified as novel strategies that can be employed
  to directly target and correct the genetic mutations associated with FOP. Anti-inflammatory
  medications can reduce the risk of HO in FOP patients by inhibiting inflammatory
  factors. (Created with BioRender: UO26177N1O)'
