figure_title: The effect of Crp/cAMP on Persister Cell Metabolism during Stationary
  Phase
caption: '(a) MS analysis of E. coli K-12 MG1655 WT, Δcrp, and ΔcyaA at early (t=5h)
  and late (t=24h) stationary phases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied
  to standardized metabolic data. Each column represents a biological replicate. n=4.
  (b) Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using MetaboAnalyst. Upregulated and
  downregulated pathways of the Δcrp strain compared to WT in the late-stationary
  growth phase were provided in this figure (refer to Supplementary Fig. 5, 6, and
  7 for the other pairwise comparisons). (c, d) Pathway enrichment maps comparing
  metabolites of the TCA cycle, pentose phosphate metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis,
  and pyruvate metabolism in Δcrp versus WT for ESP and LSP conditions, respectively.
  Circle size corresponds to the ratio of normalized metabolite intensities between
  mutant and control cells. Blue (P ≤ 0.05 for dark blue; 0.05 < P < 0.10 for light
  blue) and red (P ≤ 0.05 for dark red; 0.05 < P < 0.10 for light red) indicate significantly
  downregulated or upregulated metabolites in the mutant compared to the control.
  White signifies no significant difference. n=4 for all panels. ESP: Early stationary
  phase, LSP: Late stationary phase.'
