caption: The fecal metabolites altered in mice. Differential metabolites in fecal
  identification in different groups in (A,C,E) positive and (B,D,F) negative ion
  modes, and expression of differential metabolites in the two groups was represented
  by (Aâ€“D) volcano plot and (E,F) heat maps. (G) The number of differential metabolites
  was annotated and classified based on the HMDB changed by HFHF and the treatment
  of PCH. (H) The enrichment metabolic pathway of fecal altered metabolites by Kyoto
