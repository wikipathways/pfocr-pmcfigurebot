caption: 'NF-κB binds to the ANG promoter and regulates its transcription in response
  to LPS stimulation (A) Schematic representation of the putative NF-κB binding motif
  identified in the ANG gene promoter region (Chr 14: 20,682,781‒20,684,780) by bioinformatics
  sequence analysis. (B) ChIP-qPCR assay showing enrichment of NF-κB at the predicted
  NF-κB binding site (P1) in the ANG promoter region in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells
  (n=3). (C) Luciferase reporter assay of ANG promoter activity (n=3). (D) Effect
  of TAK242 and BAY pretreatment on ANG promoter-driven luciferase activity (n=3).
  ns: no significant, *P<0.05, ***P<0.001, compared to the untreated group in (B),
  the promoter group in (C) and the DMSO group in (D).'
