figure_title: Regulation of respiratory complications by metformin.
caption: 'Regulation of respiratory complications by metformin. By preventing the
  mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1, metformin increases AMPK levels. Metformin
  prevents activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome pathway
  in an AMPK-dependent and -independent manner. Thus, by preventing immune and inflammatory
  responses, metformin prevents airway inflammation, airway remodeling, and hyperresponsiveness
  during respiratory complications. AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; IL-1b: interleukin
  -1b; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa binding protein; NLRP3: NLR family pyrin domain
  containing 3; and ROS: reactive oxygen species'
