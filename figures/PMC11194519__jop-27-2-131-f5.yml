caption: Western blot analysis of JNK, MKK7, and c-Jun signaling pathways and brief
  chart model of underlying mechanisms of the CBD on cell death and oxidative stress
  of hMSC. (A) Western blot analysis of p-JNK, JNK, p-MKK7, MKK7, p-c-Jun and c-Jun
  were performed using hMSC protein lysates. Actinin was used as inner control of
  the Western blot analysis. (B) Brief chart of pharmacological actions of the CBD
  via regulation of JNK/MKK7/c-Jun signaling pathway.
