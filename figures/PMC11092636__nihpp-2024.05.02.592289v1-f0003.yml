figure_title: Exercise activates the EGFR/insulin signaling
caption: (a) Heat map of reversed DEGs within the insulin signaling in different cell
  clusters. (b-c) RNAscope analysis of Stxbp1, a gene of the insulin/EGFR pathway
  with known function in neurotransmission and a robust reversed expression pattern
  in EN. Scale bar, 200 μm. n = 3 mice. Bar graphs show the mean with S.E.M. Asterisks
  indicate significant differences by t-test. ns, non-significant. (d) Some of the
  DEGs in the EGFR pathway. (e) Some of the DEGs in the insulin pathway. Images were
  generated from the KEGG pathway database
