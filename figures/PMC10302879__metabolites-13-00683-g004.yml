figure_title: WGCNA and pathway analysis of the polyamine metabolic pathway.
caption: 'WGCNA and pathway analysis of the polyamine metabolic pathway. (a) Heatmap
  of the correlation between module genes and metabolites: each row represents a module,
  each column represents a metabolite, and the color and value of each cell at the
  intersection of the row and column represent the correlation coefficient between
  the module and the sample and p-value. (b) Expression profiles of “MEpink” modules
  in different coconut cultivars. (c) The heatmap represents the change in the expression
  levels of the genes and the accumulation levels of the metabolites. From red to
  blue or to green, the heatmap indicates the expression levels of genes or the accumulation
  levels of metabolites ranging from high to low'
