figure_title: Metabolic pathway analysis of differential lipids.
caption: Metabolic pathway analysis of differential lipids. Analysis of metabolic
  pathways (A), molecular correlation network (B), and biomarker levels (C) of common
  differentiators in human milk and goat milk comparison groups, analysis of metabolic
  pathways (D), molecular correlation network (E), and biomarker levels (F) of common
  differentiators in a comparison group of goat milk during different lactations.
  Abundance distribution of fatty acids (FAs) in the GL, GP, and SP lipid molecules
  of HM (G–I) and Goat-E (J–L). * is p < 0.05, ** is p < 0.01, **** is p < 0.0001,
  “ns” is no significant
