caption: The MYD88/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway is associated with Gem resistance in PDAC
  cells. (A) A schematic illustrates the differentially expressed genes in the BxPC-3-R
  vs. BxPC-3-Parental cell line (GSE 140077) and MIA-PaCa-2-R vs. MIA-PaCa-2-Parental
  cell line (GSE 148200). The Venn diagram represents the upregulated and downregulated
  expression of genes selected using Log2FC > 0.5 and p < 0.05. (B) Scatter plots
  of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up- and downregulated genes in Gem-R PDAC
  cell lines. The top 15 significantly enriched KEGG pathways were prioritized. The
  circle represents the number of differentially expressed genes, while the circle
  color represents the range of p-values. (C) The expression level of the selected
  genes, MYD88, was analyzed using PDAC cases from the TCGA dataset. (D) qRT-PCR assays
  were undertaken to measure the mRNA expression levels of selected genes in Gem-R
  and parental PDAC cell lines, with Î²-actin expression as the internal control. *
  p indicates p < 0.05 vs. control group; *** p indicates p < 0.001
