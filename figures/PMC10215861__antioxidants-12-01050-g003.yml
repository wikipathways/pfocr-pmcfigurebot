figure_title: The roles of RONSs during skeletal muscle pathologies.
caption: 'The roles of RONSs during skeletal muscle pathologies. Redox pathways in
  COPD, DMD and sarcopenia, mitochondria dysfunction and sarcomere NO leakage produce
  OS, which causes muscle damage leading to muscle atrophy. Protein balance pathways:
  the IGF1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR protein synthesis pathway is impacted by OS. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction due to the RONS active, AMPK, inhibiting mTOR and leading to rapid atrophy.
  Inflammatory pathways: inflammation is increased by OS via (+) NF-κB and TNF-α,
  activating UPS and resulting in muscle atrophy. In addition, OS triggers the release
  of antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2; however, SOD, CAT and GPx are insufficient to compensate
  for the overproduction of OH− and ONOO−. According to the roles played by RONSs
  and their consequences, the described pathologies support OS-induced muscle atrophy
  and damage. Created using Biorender.com (accessed on 28 April 2023)'
