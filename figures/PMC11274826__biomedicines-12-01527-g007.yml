caption: OPN-targeted novel therapeutic strategies. OPN-specific siRNA, miRNA, shRNA,
  Small molecule inhibitors (Andrographolide, Curcumin, etc.), OPN neutralizing antibodies,
  OPN aptamers, synthetic RGD peptides, and CD44 and integrin blocking antibodies
  have been used recently as therapeutic approaches to target the OPN-integrin/CD44
  axis, which leads to downregulation of various oncogenic molecules and suppression
  of tumor progression by disrupting the OPN-regulated signaling pathways in cancers
