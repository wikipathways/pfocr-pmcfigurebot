caption: Schematic overview of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced podocyte
  damage mediated by miR-143 and miR-145. TGF-β1 independently activates regulatory
  Smad and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, each of which leads to
  the increased expression of miR-143 and miR-145. miR-145 (and possibly miR-143)
  may form a positive feedback loop by activating the Smad pathway. Furthermore, miR-143
  and miR-145 each reduces the expression of Wilm’s tumor 1 (WT1) that is essential
  for normal cellular function and increases the expression of collagen type I associated
  with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
