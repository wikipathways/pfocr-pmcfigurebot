caption: The activation of the AMPK/mTOR or PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathways inhibits
  the viability and promotes the apoptosis of ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells treated
  with G-Rg1. (A) The viability of ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells co-treated with G-Rg1
  and AICAR or CCT020312 was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. (B) LDH levels
  were measured in ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells co-treated with G-Rg1 and AICAR or
  CCT020312 using the corresponding LDH kit. (C and D) The apoptotic rate of ethanol-stimulated
  H9c2 cells co-treated with G-Rg1 and AICAR or CCT020312 was determined using flow
  cytometric analysis. (E) Caspase-3 activity in ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cells co-treated
  with G-Rg1 and AICAR or CCT020312 was detected using the corresponding kit. (F)
  The protein expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 were measured in ethanol-stimulated
  H9c2 cells co-treated with G-Rg1 and AICAR or CCT020312 using western blot analysis.
  The results are expressed as the mean ± SD. The experiments were repeated for three
  times. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. G-Rg1, ginsenoside Rg1; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
