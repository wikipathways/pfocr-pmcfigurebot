caption: CEP inhibits the phosphorylation of MAPKs and the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A–C) Western blot analysis of the impact of CEP on the phosphorylation of ERK (B),
  and JNK (C) signaling pathways in LPS-induced macrophages (n = 3). (D,E) Western
  blot analysis of the impact of CEP on the phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 signaling
  pathway in LPS-induced macrophages (n = 3). The results shown are means ± SEM, *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
