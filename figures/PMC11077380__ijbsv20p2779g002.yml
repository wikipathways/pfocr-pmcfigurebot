caption: The mechanism diagram illustrates the crosstalk between Se-AA metabolism
  and various cell types in the TME. A) The multiple action of Se-AAs on tumor cell-related
  pathways. B) The functions of Se-AAs in programming macrophage immune responses.
  C) Se-AAs promote T-cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytotoxicity. D) Se-AAs
  boost the antitumor activities of NK cells
