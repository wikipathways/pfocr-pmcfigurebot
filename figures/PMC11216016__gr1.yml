caption: RNA-Seq analysis results of Nano-Se, Nano-S and Nano-Se@S in mice. (A) Schematic
  illustration RNA-Seq of Nano-Se, Nano-S and Nano-Se@S. (B) Volcano maps of Nano-Se,
  Nano-S and Nano-Se@S significantly upregulated and downregulated genes (fold change
  ≥2 and P < 0.05). (C) GSEA analysis of Nano-Se, Nano-S and Nano-Se@S in FGFR and
  Hippo pathway. (D) Heat maps of significantly upregulated genes related to FGFR
  and Hippo pathway. (E) Diagram of the wound healing accelerated by Nano-Se through
  FGFR pathway and Nano-S through Hippo pathway.
