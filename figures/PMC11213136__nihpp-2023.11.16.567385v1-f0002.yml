figure_title: Knockdown of FgfA1 induces loss of the apical tuft.
caption: 'Knockdown of FgfA1 induces loss of the apical tuft. (A) Live images of 48
  hpf larvae injected with scrambled control shRNA (ctrl shRNA) or FgfA1 shRNA. (B)
  Images of fixed, 48 hpf larvae treated with 20μM SU5402 or vehicle control (DMSO)
  and stained with DAPI (nuclei), phalloidin (F-actin), and anti-acetylated tubulin
  antibody (cilia). Arrows in A,B point to apical tuft cilia and dotted circles indicate
  loss of apical tuft. The oral pole is to the left in A,B; scale bars = 20μm. (C)
  Quantitative analysis of apical tuft cilia length in the shRNA experiment (grey
  boxes) and pharmacological experiment (cyan boxes). Box plots are presented as:
  median – middle line, 25th and 75th percentiles – box, 5th and 95th percentiles
  – whiskers. Sample sizes for each treatment: wild type N=10, ctrl shRNA N=8, FgfA1
  shRNA N=10, DMSO N=10, SU5402 N=12. P-values from ANOVA with TukeyHSD posthoc: wild
  type vs. ctrl shRNA: p=0.5839021, wild type vs FgfA1 shRNA: p=0.0000064, ctrl shRNA
  vs FgfA1 shRNA: p= 0.0000001, wild type vs DMSO: p= 0.0154365, DMSO vs SU5402: p=
  0.0004114, FgfA1 shRNA vs SU5402: p= 0.3147784. Letters indicate groups that are
  significantly different. (D) Cladogram of hard corals and sea anemones plotting
  the distribution of taxa with a larval apical tuft (cartoons, right). The apical
  tuft was likely lost in the ancestor of Scleractinia (black circle) and regained
  in the ancestor of the clade containing Astrangia and Oculina and at least one species
  of Caryophyllia (magenta circles). An Fgf signaling pathway controls apical tuft
  development in Astrangia poculata (this study) and Nematostella vectensis (Rentzsch
  et al., 2008). The cladogram was inferred from two studies of overlapping taxa (Kitahara
  et al., 2010; McFadden et al., 2021). References indicating presence/absence of
  apical tuft by taxon: Pocillopora (Tran and Hadfield, 2013), Stylophora (Atoda,
  1951), Caryophyllia (Tranter et al., 1982), Lophelia (Larsson et al., 2014), Astrangia
  (Szmant-Froelich et al., 1980), Oculina (Brooke and Young, 2003), Acropora (Hayward
  et al., 2015), Galaxea (Atoda, 1951), Porites (Santiago-Valentín et al., 2022),
  Nematostella (Hand and Uhlinger, 1992), other sea anemones: Anthopleura (Chia and
  Koss, 1979), Exaiptasia (Bucher et al., 2016), Gonactinia (Chia et al., 1989)'
