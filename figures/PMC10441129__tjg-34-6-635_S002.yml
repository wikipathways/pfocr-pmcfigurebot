caption: The expression of Ras-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in HCC was affected with the FBLN2
  overexpression or downregulation. Graphs of densitometric quantification of the
  expression of p-ERK1/2, p-MEK and Ras in (A) HCCLM3 cells in the presence of FBLN2
  overexpress or in (B) SNU398 cells that stably transduced with shRNAs (shFBLN2-1
  or shFBLN2-2) or control shRNA (sh-NC). β-actin, GAPDH, and β-tubulin were used
  as loading control depending on circumstances. The results were shown as means ±
  SD. *P < .05; **P < .01; ***P < .001; ****P < .0001
