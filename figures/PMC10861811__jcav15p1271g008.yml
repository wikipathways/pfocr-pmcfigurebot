caption: NFIL3 involves in regulating p53 signaling pathway. (A) KEGG enrichment analysis
  of the intersection of NFIL3 targets and the differential gene expression between
  normal ovary and ovarian cancer tissue. (B-C) qRT-PCR analysis of P53, P21 and Bax
  expression in SKOV3 and MR182 cells. GAPDH serves as an internal control. (D-E)
  The protein levels of NFIL3, p53, p21 and BAX were monitored by western blot after
  overexpression of NFIL3 in A2780 and MR182 cells. (F-G) The protein levels of NFIL3,
  p53, P21 and BAX were examined by WB after knockdown of NFIL3 in A2780 and MR182
  cells. GAPDH serves as an internal control. (H) P53 was colocalized with NFIL3 in
  confocal analysis in A2780 and 293FT, as indicated by white arrow. Scale bar is
  25 Î¼m. (I) The interaction of p53 and NFIL3 by Co-IP in SKOV3. *p<0.05, **p<0.01,
  ***p<0.001. Experiment was repeated 3 times (n = 3)
