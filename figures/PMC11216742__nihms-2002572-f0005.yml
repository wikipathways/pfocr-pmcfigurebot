figure_title: Comparison of enriched KEGG pathways among EDC study clusters
caption: (A-C) Upset plot of significant KEGG pathways (FDR<0.05) enriched for total
  DEGs (A), up-regulated DEGs (B) and down-regulated DEGs (C). Horizontal bars (set
  size) indicate total number of pathways for each cluster in each plot. In the upset
  plots, dots point to the specific EDC clusters for which the vertical bars for pathway
  counts are shown, and vertical lines between dots represent the intersections between
  two or more clusters. Terms labeled in red indicate metabolic pathways of interest.
