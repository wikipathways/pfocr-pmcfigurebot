caption: SCD1 and GPX4 are differentially expressed in specimens from patients with
  liver cancer. (A) Representative images showing protein expression of SCD1 in human
  liver cancer tissues and normal liver tissues. (B) The relative mRNA expression
  levels of SCD1 in liver cancer tissues were obtained from TCGA database. (C) Correlation
  between SCD1 and GPX4 based on TCGA data. (D) Representative protein expression
  of GPX4 in human liver cancer tissues and normal liver tissues. (E) The relative
  mRNA expression levels of GPX4 in liver cancer tissues were obtained from TCGA database.
  (F) A diagram showing the mechanism by which aurantio-obtusin induces ferroptosis
  by suppressing the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and enhances RSL3-induced ferroptosis by inhibiting
  the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1/SCD1 axis. FASN, fatty acid synthase; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase
  4; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; LIHC, liver hepatocellular carcinoma; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; MUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1; SREBP1, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1
