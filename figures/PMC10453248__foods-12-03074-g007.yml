figure_title: Effects of TPE on intestinal barrier function and the TLR4/NF-ΚB signal
  pathway in colon tissue of HFD-fed mice.
caption: 'Effects of TPE on intestinal barrier function and the TLR4/NF-ΚB signal
  pathway in colon tissue of HFD-fed mice. (A) Representative images of immunofluorescence
  of ZO-1 and Occludin. Right: Relative fluorescence intensity of ZO-1 and Occludin.
  (B) Representative images of immunofluorescence of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-ΚB in the
  colon. Right: Relative fluorescence intensity of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-ΚB. The data
  are expressed as the means ± SEM (n = 3). * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01, indicating
  significant differences between these groups'
