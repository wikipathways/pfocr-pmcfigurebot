figure_title: (A) The difference of amino acid metabolism pathway between P0 and CK.
caption: (A) The difference of amino acid metabolism pathway between P0 and CK. (B)
  The difference of amino acid metabolism pathway between PT and CK. (C) Difference
  of amino acid metabolism pathway between PR and CK. (D) The difference of amino
  acid metabolism pathway between PS and CK. The abscissa represents the corresponding
  Rich factor for each pathway. The Rich factor is the ratio of the number of differential
  metabolites in the corresponding pathway to the total number of metabolites annotated
  by the pathway. The higher the value, the greater the enrichment degree is. The
  ordinate is the path name, and the color of the point is the p-value. The redder
  the point, the more significant the enrichment is. The size of the dot represents
  the number of enriched differential metabolites. The red dotted line represents
  the metabolic pathway with p < 0.05
