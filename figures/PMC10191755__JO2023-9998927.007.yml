caption: Enrichment analysis of gene signaling pathways between the SRSF1high group
  and the SRSF1low groups. GSEA showed that spliceosome (a), metabolism of RNA (b),
  protein ubiquitination (c), P53 signaling pathway (d), MYC targets (e), signaling
  by NOTCH (f), interleukin 12 signaling (g), downstream signaling events of B cell
  receptor BCR (h), and MARK6/4 signaling (i) were enriched in the SRSF1high group.
