caption: The activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in mice with AIH and in LPS-stimulated
  AML12 cells is suppressed by SOP treatment. (A) The enrichment analysis in Transcription
  Factor Targets of common targets between predicted SOP and AIH-related genes targets.
  (B) Western blot analysis of NF-κB protein expression in mouse liver. (C) Representative
  images of immunostaining for p-p65 NF-κB in the liver. (D) The cell viability of
  AML12 cells treated with SOP at 0, 50, 100 and 200 µM for 48 h. (E) AML12 cells
  were pre-treated with SOP at 50 and 100 µM with or without LPS (1,000 ng/ml) for
  24 h. Cell lysates were collected for the determination of NF-κB protein expression
  using western blot analysis. (F) Cells were stained with anti-p65 NF-κB (red) and
  DAPI (blue) and immunofluorescence images were obtained by confocal microscopy.
