figure_title: GLP-1 signaling pathways in pancreatic beta cells.
caption: GLP-1 signaling pathways in pancreatic beta cells. Secreted GLP-1 from enteroendocrine
  L cells in the small intestine epithelium acts on several target cells, such as
  pancreatic beta cells. GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with cAMP-dependent
  pathways, which amplify regulated exocytosis and increase cell survival and proliferation.
  Amplification and survival pathways controlled by cAMP as a second messenger activate
  PKA and EPAC sensors. Once activated, these sensors maintain endocrine function
  by modulating CREB transcriptional activity
