caption: 'Schematic representation of interactions between glucose, galactose, and
  amino acid metabolism oriented toward the production of cytosolic NADPH in Trypanosoma
  cruzi epimastigotes. Black, orange, and blue arrows represent the main steps of
  glucose, amino acids, and galactose metabolism, respectively. Arrows with different
  thicknesses tentatively represent the metabolic flux of each enzymatic step. The
  glycosome, cytosol, and mitochondrion compartments are indicated. Cytosolic NADPH
  is highlighted enclosed in a rhombus. Abbreviations: 1,3 dPG, 1,3 biphosphoglycerate;
