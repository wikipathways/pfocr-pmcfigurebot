figure_title: Down-regulation of type I IFN signaling is associated with poor prognosis
  in HER2+ BC patients.
caption: 'Down-regulation of type I IFN signaling is associated with poor prognosis
  in HER2+ BC patients. WGCNA analysis was performed using RNA expression data of
  BC treated with one dose of Herceptin in the GSE76360 cohort. (A) Schematic depiction
  of the GSE76360 cohort we used. (B) Gene dendrogram and modules before merging.
  (C) Pearson correlation analysis of merged modules and clinical characteristics.
  (D) Scatterplot of blue module and clinical response. (E) The bubble plot showed
  the enriched GO pathways of genes in blue module. (F-G) The ridge plot showed the
  gene set enrichment of DEGs before and after Herceptin treatment in BC patients
  with pCR (F) or no response (G). (H) The boxplots showed the tumor microenvironmental
  components estimated by xCell algorithm in BC patients with no response. *p < 0.05.
