caption: The SCFTIR1/AFB-dependant auxin response pathway is shaded in pink. The TIR1/AFB
  auxin co-receptors belong to a family of F-box proteins and mediate responses after
  perceiving auxin. Binding IAA triggers recruitment of the SCFTIR1 E3 ubiquitin protein
  ligase complex to the Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic acid (Aux/IAA) repressor proteins causing
  their degradation. This allows Auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors
  to dimerize at the promoters of auxin-inducible genes thus activating gene expression
  []. ARFs can interact with transcription factors from other pathways such as PIF4
  (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4) and BZR1. Auxin modulates the brassinosteroid
  pathway via BRI1 which has an auxin-response element targeted by ARFs []. Auxins
  increase expression of brassinosteroid receptor, BRI1, and brassinosteroid -responsive
  genes due to the presence of auxin-response elements targeted by ARFs in their promoters
  []. The RXLR effector PSE1from Phytophthora parasitica reduces auxin accumulation
  by altering distribution of the PIN4 and PIN7 auxin efflux carriers making the plant
  more susceptible []. The Brassinosteroid pathway is shaded green and the described
  brassinosteroid pathway components are same as in . Brassinosteroid responses can
  promote gibberellin biosynthesis to increase DELLA degradation []. PIN-LIKES (PILS)
  protein family of auxin transport facilitators can control the intracellular auxin
  accumulation at the ER regulating auxin homeostasis []. Brassinosteroid signalling
  restricts PILS transcription and protein levels and, thereby, increases nuclear
  abundance and signalling of auxin []. BIN2 is crucial to potentiate auxin signalling
  by phosphorylating ARF7 and ARF19 []. However, de-phosphorylation of BIN2 during
  immune responses reduces auxins signalling. The Gibberellin pathway is shaded in
  blue. Gibberellins (GA) activates receptor GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1)
  which induces interaction with DELLA proteins []. The GA-GID1-DELLA complex interacts
  with SCFSLY1/GID2, a E3 ubiquitin ligase, and is targeted for proteasomal degradation
  [,] resulting in a lower abundance of DELLAs. DELLAs are negative regulators of
  many transcription factors that can heterodimerise to induce integrated responses
  e.g. from light, brassinosteroid and auxin response pathways [,]. The Xanthomonas
  campestris effector protein, XopDXcc8004, targets and delays the degradation of
  a GA repressor DELLA protein to trigger plant disease []. When leaves are shaded
  from light, then a low Red:FarRed causes accumulation of the inactive form of the
  red light receptor Phytochrome B (PhyB) which suppresses the activity of PIFs [].
  UV-B and Cold stress activate the positive bZIP transcriptional regulator, HY5 (ELONGATED
  HYPOCOTYL 5). HY5 promotes the accumulation of DELLA proteins under UV-B radiation
  [] while cold stress, can activate or suppress DELLAs, which control a multitude
  of other responses relevant in plant immunity [] as described in . The Arabidopsis
  downy mildew effector HaRxLL470 suppresses plant immunity by decreasing the DNA‐binding
  activity of HY5 []. The HOMOLOG OF BEE2 INTERACTING WITH IBH1 (HBI1), functions
  with other transcription factorsto mediate positive and negative transcriptional
  changes of many growth and defence responses [,]. The authors acknowledge that they
  couldn’t include all known and emerging interaction events in this figure. Created
