caption: Diagram of the mechanism by which Pin1 regulates NAFLD. On the one hand,
  Pin1 promotes liver lipid aggregation, inflammation, and fibrosis by inhibiting
  AMPK mediated phosphorylation of ACC1 and downstream signaling pathway proteins,
  exacerbating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; On the other hand, Pin1 regulates
  the activation of SREBP1, promotes the expression of fat synthase, aggravates liver
  lipid deposition, and promotes the process of NAFLD. During this process, Pin1 can
  enhance the activity of ACC1 by directly binding to block its phosphorylation, thereby
  accelerating the synthesis of fatty acids and promoting liver steatosis by acting
  on the AMPK/ACC1 pathway
