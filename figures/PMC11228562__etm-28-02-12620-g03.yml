figure_title: Changes in central carbon metabolism of cancer and the TNF signaling
  pathway map.
caption: Changes in central carbon metabolism of cancer and the TNF signaling pathway
  map. (A) Changes in the central carbon metabolism of cancer cells in the cisplatin
  and NC groups. (B) Changes in the TNF signaling pathway in the cisplatin and NC
  groups. (C) Changes in the central carbon metabolism of cancer cells in the cisplatin
  + YSJZD vs. the cisplatin group. (D) Changes in the TNF signaling pathway in the
  cisplatin + YSJZD vs. the cisplatin group. Green represents background genes while
  red and yellow indicate DEGs with considerably elevated and decreased expression,
  respectively. NC, normal control; YSJZD, Yishen Jiangzhuo decoction; DEGs, differentially
  expressed genes
