caption: CBD dysregulates the expression of effectors of the IL−1β/IL-IR/β-catenin
  signaling pathway in tumors. (A) Representative western blot of the proteins BIRC3,
  ∆NP63α isoform, pAKT (Ser473), AKT and CB1 isolated from 60-day tumor cells that
  were treated with CBD (TS) or from mice that were pretreated with CBD (PS). (B)
  Densitometric analysis of protein expression; the values were normalized to actin
  and reported relative to those in cells of CBD-untreated tumors. Data represent
  the average of three different tumors. Asterisks indicate p < 0.05
