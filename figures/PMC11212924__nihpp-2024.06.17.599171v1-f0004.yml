figure_title: Local auxin uncaging globally rescues defects in pavement cell interdigitation
  resulting from disruption of the TIR1/AFB signaling pathway
caption: (A) Exogenous auxin treatments restore defects in PC interdigitation observed
  in iaa18D. The gain-of-function mutant iaa18D results from a point mutation in domain
  II of AUX/IAA protein causing their stabilization and inhibition of auxin transcriptional
  responses. Seedlings were grown in the absence or presence of 20 nM NAA for 4 days.
  Scale bars = 50 μm. (B) Quantitative analysis of the PC interdigitation phenotype
  in iaa18D mutant as shown in panel B. Statistical analysis showed that the mean
  lobe number per cell in wild-type cotyledon PCs was significantly greater than in
  iaa18D PCs (purple opaque) but not different from iaa18D PCs treated with NAA (purple
  translucid). n=250–388 cells from 8 different cotyledons, each from different seedlings.
  Results representative from 4 experimental replicates. (C) Schematics of the local
  auxin uncaging protocol. 3.5-days-old seedlings were soaked in either caged-mock
  (100 μM DMPNB-AcOH) or caged auxin (100 μM DMPNB-NAA) for 5 h. Then, seedlings were
  UV-treated for 30 sec (25% laser, 60 mW) and placed back in semi-solid medium to
  grow for 2 days. Cotyledons were then excised and stained to analyze cell shape
  outside of the UV-treated area. (D) Local auxin uncaging globally induced lobing
  in tir1Qt but not in tmkQ mutants. Representative images from seedlings treated
  as shown in C. Scale bar = 50 μm. (E) Quantitative analysis of PC interdigitation
  as shown in D. Lobe number per cell is shown. For each genotype, split violins show
  the mock (opaque) and NAA treatment (translucent) values. Box plot inside each violin
  plot depicts four quartiles and the median. Red dot depicts the average. n = 305–335
  cells from 8 different cotyledons, each from different seedlings. Similar results
  were obtained in 5 independent experiments. t-test, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.001
