caption: Network analysis of oxaliplatin revealed that oxaliplatin as a master regulator
  was predicted to be inhibited and the SPINK1 pancreatic cancer pathway was inactivated
  in ischemic cardiomyopathy. (a) The network of oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin was predicted
  to be inhibited as a master regulator in ischemic cardiomyopathy. (b) The SPINK1
  pancreatic cancer pathway was inactivated in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Gene identifiers
  marked with an asterisk (*) indicate that multiple identifiers in the dataset file
  map to a single gene in the Global Molecular Network
