caption: (A) A schematic diagram of the glycolysis and TCA cycle pathways. (B) The
  HK activity in P. kluyveri Y-11519 in the presence and absence of D-limonene at
  different concentrations (*** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001). (C) The effect of D-limonene
  on the glycolysis and TCA cycle gene transcription in P. kluyveri Y-11519. (D) The
  IDH activity in P. kluyveri Y-11519 in the presence and absence of D-limonene at
  different concentrations (**** p < 0.0001). (E) The hk gene expression was verified
  via RT-qPCR analysis. (F) The differentially expressed genes during the TCA cycle
  were verified via RT-qPCR analysis
