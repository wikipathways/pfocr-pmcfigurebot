caption: Changes in the gene expression profile of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS)
  rats after exosomes from retinal organoids (Exo-ROs) treatment. Total RNA is analyzed
  in the eyes of RCS rats before and after Exo-RO treatment using RNA-seq. (A) Transcriptional
  profiling of retinal cell markers. Exo-RO treatment significantly upregulates the
  expression of photoreceptors, rod cells, cone cells, and retinal pigment epithelium
  cells (* FDR q < 0.05). (B,C) Gene ontology analysis of upregulated genes in Exo-RO-treated
  retinas. (B) The genes are mainly enriched in ‘endocrine system development’, ‘response
  to retinoic acid’, and ‘visual perception’ for biological processes. (C) The genes
  are mainly enriched in ‘extracellular matrix’, ‘photoreceptor outer segment’, and
  ‘melanosome membrane’ for cellular components. (D) The expression of inflammation-related
  pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt,
  and RAS signaling, is significantly downregulated in Exo-RO-treated retinas (logFC
  < −1, false discovery rate [q-value] < 0.05)
