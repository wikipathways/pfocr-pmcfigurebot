figure_title: The IFN-γ pathway was activated in the MICA+ tumor cells and MMP9+ macrophages.
caption: The IFN-γ pathway was activated in the MICA+ tumor cells and MMP9+ macrophages.
  (a) Feature plots depicting single-cell tumor cell expression of MICA. (b) Volcano
  plots showing the single-cell transcriptional profile difference between MICA+ and
  MICA− tumor cells. (c) Feature plots depicting single-cell macrophage expression
  of MMP9. (d) Volcano plots showing the single-cell transcriptional profile difference
  between MMP9+ and MMP9- macrophage. (e,f) GSEA analysis revealed single-cell MICA
  and MMP9 expression involved in the IFN-γ signaling pathway. Red indicated that
  gene was highly expressed in the MICA+ tumor cells/ MMP9+ macrophage, and blue indicated
  that gene was highly expressed in the MICA− tumor cells/ MMP9− macrophage
