  western blot was used to identify the protein expression levels of c-Met, p-c-Met,
  AKT, p-AKT, p-mTOR and mTOR in HCCLM3 cells after miR-206 mimics transfection. (C
  and D) western blot was used to identify the protein expression levels of c-Met,
  p-c-Met, AKT, p-AKT, p-mTOR and mTOR in MHCC97-H cells after miR-206 mimics transfection.
  Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. **P<0.01 vs.
