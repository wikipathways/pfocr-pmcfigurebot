figure_title: Reversal of IPF-associated changes in biopsy Type 2 alveolar epithelial
  cells by EGCG
caption: (A) Dimensional Reduction Plot of nonciliated epithelial subtypes from Control
  (10,127 cells, n = 14), Control Biopsy (10,336 cells, n = 4) and EGCG Biopsy samples
  (11,585 cells, n = 4). (B) AEC2s as percent of nonciliated epithelium. (C) Heatmap
  of selected top up- and down-regulated Upstream IPA pathways from Control Biopsy
  vs Donor and EGCG Biopsy vs Control Biopsy comparisons in AEC2s. (D,E) NicheNet
  prediction of differential receptor-ligand signaling from fibroblasts to AEC2s as
  a result of EGCG. Blue stars highlight AEC2 trophic factors increased in EGCG biopsy
  samples, and red stars highlight pro-fibrotic pathways decreased in EGCG biopsy
  samples. (F,G) Precision-cut lung slices from IPF lung donors cultured for 7 days
  with EGCG (1mM) and analyzed by Western Blot. n=6; additional samples are shown
  in Fig. S3. Statistical significance was determined by 2-tailed t-test (B,G)
