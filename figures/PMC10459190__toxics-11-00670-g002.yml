caption: Molecular mechanisms involved in atherogenic effects of Cd exposure. Cd-induced
  ROS overproduction promotes LDL oxidation and oxLDL internalization by macrophages,
  resulting in foam cell formation. LDL oxidation is also aggravated by Cd-induced
  PON1 inhibition. Up-regulated expression of adhesion molecules including ICAM1 and
  VCAM1 following Cd exposure increases monocyte adhesion and infiltration, with their
  subsequent transformation to foam cells. Proinflammatory effect of Cd also contributes
  to atherogenesis through promotion of TMAO-induced NF-κB and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation, as well as JAK2/STAT3-dependent M1 macrophage (Mφ) polarization. Finally,
  Cd-induced alterations of gut microbiota composition along with increased gut wall
  permeability results in an increase in circulating LPS levels, also promoting proinflammatory
  signaling. Different colors (pink, grey, blue, yellow) are indicative of distinct
  pathways for better visualization. Red and blue arrows show the increase and decrease
  effects
