caption: 'Mechanisms of FGF5 promoting secondary hair follicle growth. FGF5 editing
  promotes fine wool growth by reducing cortisol concentration, increasing the antioxidant
  enzyme activity, and activating the Wnt pathway. Abbreviations: HGF, hepatocyte
  growth factor; FGF5, fibroblast growth factor 5; FGFR1, FGF receptor 1; GR, glucocorticoid
  receptor; LGR, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor; RSPO,
  Rspondin; Wnt, Wingless-type; LRP, LD-related protein'
