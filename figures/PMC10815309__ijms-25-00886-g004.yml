figure_title: Cell cycle in TP53 ± RAD51D-KD organoids.
caption: Cell cycle in TP53 ± RAD51D-KD organoids. (A) The cell cycle distribution
  in TP53 ± RAD51D-KD organoids (n = 3) was analyzed using flow cytometry. (B) GSEA
  demonstrated the enrichment of the DNA replication pathway in TP53 + RAD51D-KD organoids.
  NES—normalized enrichment score, FDR—false discovery rate. (C,D) Western blotting
  analyses (C) and associated statistical evaluation of the band intensity values
  (n = 3) (D) were conducted to assess the protein expression related to cell cycle
  checkpoint regulation. ns—not significant, p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01;
  ***, p < 0.001; and ****, p < 0.0001
