caption: Expression profiling of critical DEGs involved in the plant immunity signal
  transduction pathway in Figure 5. (a) CDPKs, CNGCs and Rbohs; (b) CaMCMLs; (c) genes
  involved in the ETI pathway; (d) genes involved in the PTI pathway. Expression values
  of each gene were the log2-transformed expression values. Colors represented the
  expression levels
