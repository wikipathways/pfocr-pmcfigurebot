figure_title: Effects of PRR14 knockdown on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
caption: Effects of PRR14 knockdown on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. (A) The representative
  blots of p‑PI3K, PI3K, p‑AKT, AKT, p‑mTOR and mTOR proteins in siPRR14 treated A431
  and HSC-1 cells. (B) The relative protein levels of p‑PI3K, PI3K, p‑AKT, AKT, p‑mTOR
  and mTOR in siPRR14 treated A431 cells. (C) The relative protein levels of p‑PI3K,
  PI3K, p‑AKT, AKT, p‑mTOR and mTOR in siPRR14 treated HSC-1 cells. *P<0.05, compared
  with siNC treated cells
