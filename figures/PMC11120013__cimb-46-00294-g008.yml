caption: Conceptual hormesis response curves for cancer (red) and normal (green) cells,
  underpinned by the different responses in cell signalling pathway regulation between
  redox stress and eustress. The red and green text boxes represent cancer and normal
  cells, respectively. Arrows indicate the direction of activation, being (↑) upregulation,
  (↓) downregulation, and (↑↑) prolonged upregulation
