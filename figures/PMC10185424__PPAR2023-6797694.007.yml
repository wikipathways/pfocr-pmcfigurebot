  Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).
caption: Nuclear protein 1 is associated with PPAR signaling pathway by Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis (GSEA). Results from the GSEA revealed that the signaling pathways in cancer
  (a) were associated with the expression of Nuclear protein 1, especially for BTCC
  (b). The PPAR (c) signaling pathway and RNA degradation (d) were correlated with
  a high expression of Nuclear protein 1
