figure_title: Spatial transcriptome sequencing reveals the localization of GRN and
  IL-13RA1 in skin biopsy
caption: A) H&E staining image of the acne biopsy used for Seq-Scope sequencing (left)
  alongside a spatial plot that identifies eight cell clusters in acne lesion (right).
  B) Spatial feature plot showing overlay of GRN in red, APOE in green, and KRT5 in
  blue with 2-μm intervals between grids; boxed region showing the magnified spatial
  plot. C) UMAP plot showing the co-expression of GRN in red and APOE in green in
  scRNA-seq dataset. D) Analysis of the relative contribution of the GRN-SORT1 ligand-receptor
  (L-R) pair within the GRN signaling communication network. E)Violin plot showing
  the SORT1 expression in subsets of myeloid cells. F) Spatial feature plot showing
  the overlay of GRN in red, SORT1 in green, and APOEin blue with 2-μm intervals between
  grids; boxed region shows the magnified spatial plot. G) Spatial feature plot showing
  the overlay of IL-13RA1 in green, KRT14 in red, and KRT5 in blue with 2-μm intervals
  between grids; boxed region showing the magnified spatial plot. H) UMAP plot showing
  the co-expression of IL-13RA1 in red and KRT14 in green in the scRNA-seq dataset.
  I) Relative contribution of each L-R pair to the overall communication network of
  IL-4 signaling pathway
