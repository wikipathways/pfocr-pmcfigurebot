figure_title: Characteristics of NLRs
caption: 'A Structure of NLRs. Based on their N-terminal domains, NLRs can be subdivided
  into four different subfamilies: NLRAs, NLRBs (also known as NAIPs), NLRCs and NLRPs.
  B Function of NLRs. Multiple NLRs serve as antigen presentation, pathogen/damage
  sensing, inflammasome activators, inflammatory signalling inhibitors. C The effects
  of NODs and NLRP3. NOD1 and NOD2 can both interact with the receptor-interacting
  protein 2 (Rip2) kinase and recruit the Rip2s through the CARD-CARD binding which
  will lead to the activation of NF-κB or MAPK pathway, resulting in the secretion
  of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α. Additionally, NOD1
  and NOD2 interact with ATG16L to mediate autophagy. NLRP3 can work in a canonical
  (inflammasome dependent) or a noncanonical manner (inflammasome independent). Canonical
  inflammasomes convert procaspase-1 into its mature form caspase-1, whereas noncanonical
  inflammasome activate procaspase-11.'
