caption: Effect of CDK14 on cell proliferation. (A-C) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
  (GSEA) of CDK14 associated with several cell proliferation-related signaling pathways,
  including DNA replication (p-value=0.008) in A, mismatch repair (p-value=0.033)
  in B, and P53 signaling pathway in C (p-value=0.008), in ovarian cancer cell lines
  from CCLE. (D) Detection of SK3R-PTX cell viability after si-CDK14 transfection
  by the CCK-8 assay. (E) Cell cycle detection in SK3R-PTX cells after CDK14-siRNA
  (si-CDK14) transfection by flow cytometry. The histogram shows the percentage of
  cell population in each phase. (F) Detection of OV3R- PTX cell viability after si-CDK14
  transfection by the CCK-8 assay. (G) Cell cycle detection in OV3R-PTX cells after
  si-CDK14 transfection by flow cytometry. The histogram shows the percentage of cell
  population in each phase. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01
