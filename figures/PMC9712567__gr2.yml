caption: Effects of CNSE and RESV on cell viability and morphological phenotypes in
  BV-2 cells. For cytotoxicity assay, (A) cells were treated with CNSE at the concentration
  (0–100 μg/mL) or RESV at doses of 5 and 10 μM for 24 h. (B) Cells were incubated
  with indicated doses of CNSE or RESV for 24 h, followed by LPS 1 μg/mL for another
  24 h. Cell viability was examined using MTT assay. For morphological analysis, after
  treatment cells with CNSE or RESV for 24 h, followed by LPS induction, (C) morphological
  changes were imaged by phase-contrast microscopy at 10× magnification. The red arrow
  shows the spindle cells. (D) The percentage of the number of cells was represented
  by a histogram graph. Data represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.
  The significant difference was represented by p-value less than 0.05 (####p < 0.0001
  vs. non-treated control, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001
  vs. LPS-treated control).
