caption: 'The biosynthetic LAMP1Δ-RUSH reporter system. (A) Schematic representation
  of the RUSH system. By co-expressing the ER hook streptavidin-KDEL with a reporter
  fused to SBP-GFP, the reporter can accumulate in the ER through the interaction
  between streptavidin and SBP. Addition of biotin allows for release of the reporter,
  which then traffics en masse through the secretory pathway. (B) Kinetic analysis
  of current RUSH cell line based on previous work. The type-1 membrane spanning RUSH
  reporter LAMP1Δ-GFP is used to monitor transport through the secretory system. Upon
  the addition of biotin, LAMP1Δ-RUSH traffics from the ER (0′), to the Golgi apparatus
  (15′), and then directly to the plasma membrane (30′–65′). From . Scale bar: 10
  μm. (C) Lattice-SIM imaging allows the observation of LAMP1Δ-RUSH leaving the Golgi
  apparatus in tubular carriers (indicated by blue arrowheads) 35 min after biotin
  addition. In the example image (single micrograph from the time series), the cytosol
  can be seen full of these tubular structures. From . Scale bar: 10 μm; insert: 2
  μm. (D) Time color-coded max projection of LAMP1Δ-RUSH carriers (represented by
  the RGB color bar 0–6s) shows their trajectory over time along the microtubular
  network (shown as a max projection). The insert shows a close-up example. From .
  Scale bar: 10 μm; insert: 2 μm. (E) Plasma membrane TIRF plane showing LAMP1Δ-RUSH
  post-Golgi tubule fusion. Tubules can be seen as bright spots as they approach and
  fuse, after which the cargo laterally diffuses on the plasma membrane. From . Scale
  bar: 10 μm; insert: 2 μm. (F) Schematic representation of the RUSH plus cell-surface
  staining protocol developed for flow cytometry analysis. (G) Quantitative cell-surface
  assay showing time course arrival of LAMP1Δ-RUSH to the plasma membrane after biotin
  addition. LAMP1Δ-RUSH cell line with a lumenal/extracellular GFP fusion was incubated
  with biotin for indicated times. Cells were subsequently labeled with a GFP binding
  nanobody fused to mCherry and underwent single-cell flow cytometry analysis. A minimum
  of 30,000 cells were analyzed for each biological repeat. The mean of the individual
  mCherry/GFP cell ratios were calculated for each experiment and are plotted on the
  graph (blue dots). Error bar = SD of at least three independent experimental repeats.'
