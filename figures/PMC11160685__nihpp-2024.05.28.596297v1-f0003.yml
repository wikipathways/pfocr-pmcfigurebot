figure_title: Astrocyte circadian translatomes and reprogramming in WT and APP/PS1
  mice
caption: A. Heatmaps showing transcripts that were rhythmic in WT astrocytes (upper)
  and rhythmic in astrocytes from APP/PS1 mice (lower). In both rows of heatmaps,
  the genes plotted are in the same order to compare differences in rhythmic expression
  between mice. B-D. KEGG pathway analysis of astrocyte transcripts identified as
  rhythmic (by RAIN analysis) in (B) both WT and APP/PS1 mice, (C) WT mice, or (D)
  APP/PS1 mice. E. Heatmap showing temporally-coordinated expression of KEGG insulin
  signaling pathway genes in astrocytes from WT mice. F. Radar plot showing acrophase
  distributions of rhythmic astrocyte transcripts from WT (green) or APP/PS1 (purple)
  mice. G. Pie chart depicting the number of transcripts that gained or lost rhythms
  in different datasets, based on compareRhythms analysis of rhythmic transcripts
  in microglia. Total of 2323 were identified as rhythmic by RAIN analysis across
  all datasets. H-K. Graphs showing circadian expression patterns of transcripts from
  microglia from WT (green) or APP/PS1 (purple) mice. H. Core clock genes Per2 and
  Arntl (Bmal1) remained rhythmic. I. Cholesterol response gene Srebf1 lost rhythmicity
  in APP/PS1. J & K. AD-related transcripts Clu, Picalm, and Chi3l1, as well as chemokine
  Ccl3 (K), gained rhythmicity in APP/PS1. Adjusted P values from RAIN are shown.
  Each datapoint is the average of two mice, each from separate experiments
