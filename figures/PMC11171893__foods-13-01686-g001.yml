figure_title: Impact of RSV on the Nrf2 signalling pathway in zearalenone-induced
  gut oxidative stress in mice.
caption: 'Impact of RSV on the Nrf2 signalling pathway in zearalenone-induced gut
  oxidative stress in mice. Indicators of oxidative stress (a) MDA, (b) T-SOD, and
  (c) CAT (n = 6). (d) Immunohistochemical analyses of Nrf2 (magnification: 100× and
  scale bar: 50 μm). Representative western blot images (e) and quantification of
  (f) HO-1 and (g) Nrf2 (n = 3). Relative expression of mRNA in the jejunum (h) NQO1,
  (i) GSH-PX, and (j) γ-GCS (n = 6). Values are presented as the mean ± SD of each
  treatment. “##” p < 0.01 compared to control group; “*” p < 0.05 and “**” p < 0.01
  compared ZEA group'
