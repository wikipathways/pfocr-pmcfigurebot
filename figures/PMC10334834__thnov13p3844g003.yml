  in vitro.
caption: HBBplus@CA nanoparticles suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway in vitro.
  Volcano plots of genes differentially expressed in B16F10 cells after exposure to
  60μM HBBplus@CA for 24 h compared with mock-incubated cells (n = 3). (B) Heatmaps
  depict supervised clustering of the significantly modified genes between HBBplus@CA
  and control subgroups. (C) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of MAPK signaling
  in HBBplus@CA and control subgroups, involving activation of MAPK ability, ERK1/ERK2
  cascade, and regulation of MAPK cascade pathway (n = 3 samples per group). NES,
  normalized enrichment score. (D) GSEA showing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  and β-catenin nuc pathway differentially expressed in response to HBBplus@CA (n
  = 3). NES, normalized enrichment score. (E) A heatmap representing regulated genes
  by HBBplus@CA compared to control. (F) Western blot analysis for the expression
  of β-catenin, np-β-catenin, and C-myc proteins in B16F10 cells after different treatments.
  GAPDH was used as the loading control
