  by regulating the Rap1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
caption: 'ZYX restrains osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by
  regulating the Rap1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. (A,B) Western blot and quantitative
  analysis confirmed the shRNA efficiency in 143B and U2OS cells. GAPDH is used as
  an internal reference. (C,D) CCK-8 assay suggested that silencing Rap1 attenuated
  the inhibition of ZYX overexpression on the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells.
  (E–G) Wound-healing assay and its quantitative analysis revealed that knockdown
  of Rap1 can significantly attenuate the inhibitory effect of ZYX overexpression
  on the migration ability of osteosarcoma cells. Scale bar: 200 μm. (H,I) Transwell
  invasion assay and its quantitative analysis showed that silencing Rap1 impaired
  the inhibitory effect of ZYX overexpression on the invasion ability of osteosarcoma
  cells. Scale bar: 400 μm. All data are from three independent experiments and are
  shown as mean ± SD. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001'
