caption: Analysis of co-expression patterns of genes related to the phytohormone signaling
  pathway in Moso bamboo shoots at different stages of development. Different shapes
  represent different phytohormones, with darker colors representing more co-expressed
  genes and higher Cytoscape software (V3.8.2) scores
