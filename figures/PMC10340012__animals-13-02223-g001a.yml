figure_title: Effect of interference with DGAT gene on differentiation of bovine proadipocytes.
caption: 'Effect of interference with DGAT gene on differentiation of bovine proadipocytes.
  (A) mRNA expression of DGAT post siRNA infection. (B) Oil red O staining (Scale
  bars: 200 µm). (C) Concentration of triglycerides and adiponectin. (D) Expression
  of genes associated with triglyceride synthesis pathway. (E) Expression of genes
  associated with lipid metabolism. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3).
  The different letters (a–d) represent significant differences (p < 0.05) in gene
  expression'
