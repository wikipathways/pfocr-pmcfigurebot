figure_title: KMT2D mutations inhibited FBXW7 and activated NOTCH/MYC cascade.
caption: KMT2D mutations inhibited FBXW7 and activated NOTCH/MYC cascade. (A). Pathway
  enrichment analysis of DLBCL patients with or without KMT2D mutations according
  to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. (B). Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis (GSEA) enriched differentially expressed genes in NOTCH signaling pathway
  with or without KMT2D mutations. Enrichment scores were listed with p-value. NES,
  normalized enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate. (C). Immunohistochemistry
  study of intracellular portions of NOTCH1 (NICD) in tumor samples of DLBCL patients
  with or without KMT2D mutations. (D). Normalized mRNA expression of MYC in tumor
  samples of DLBCL patients with or without KMT2D mutations as revealed by RNA sequencing.
  (E). Normalized mRNA expression of NOTCH1 in tumor samples of DLBCL patients with
  or without KMT2D mutations as revealed by RNA sequencing. (F). Genes associated
  with NOTCH signaling pathway calculated based on rank metric score from GSEA in
  KMT2Dmut DLBCL patients, as compared to KMT2Dwt DLBCL patients. (G). Occupancies
  of H3K4me3 in the proximal promoter areas of FBXW7 in KMT2Dwt, KMT2DR5432Q, KMT2Dkd
  and Scramble SU-DHL-4 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. (H).
  Protein expression of FBXW7, NICD and MYC in KMT2DC5092R, KMT2DG5182fs, KMT2DW5395X,
  KMT2DR5432Q, KMT2Dkd1 and KMT2Dkd2 SU-DHL-4 cells, as compared to KMT2Dwt or Scramble
  cells by western blot. β-actin was used as a loading control. (I). Protein expression
  of NICD and MYC in KMT2DR5432Q and KMT2Dkd SU-DHL-4 cells by western blot with and
  without NOTCH inhibitor (γ-secretase inhibitor, GSI-I, 50μm) treatment for 48h.
  β-actin was used as a loading control
