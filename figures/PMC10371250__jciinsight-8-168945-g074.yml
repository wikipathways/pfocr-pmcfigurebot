figure_title: A schematic illustration of the role of STING in diabetic retinopathy
  (DR)
caption: STING-mediated induction of the retinal type I IFNs secretion through TBK1/IRF3
  and inflammatory molecules via the TBK1/NF-ÎºB pathway in diabetes results in increased
  endothelial cell senescence and production of superoxide. These factors combine
  to cause retinal microvascular injuries in DR. Hyperglycemia evokes various other
  pathological mechanisms such as retinal neurodegeneration, accumulation of AGEs,
  and induction of PKC, the polyol, and the hexosamine pathways also critical in DR,
  independently of STING. STING may serve as a hub that stimulates multiple pathways
  (also promoted by these other factors) that collectively promote this multifaceted
  disease. All processes are interconnected to the development and progression of
  DR. AGEs, advanced glycation end products; PKC, protein kinase C; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species
