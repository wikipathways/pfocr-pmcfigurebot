caption: 'Overview of MDM2 and CDK4 pathway regulation. One of the main roles of MDM2
  is through its direct binding and inhibition of TP53-mediated activation of cell
  cycle arrest and apoptosis. Nutlins inhibit MDM2-TP53. Active CDK4 in complex with
  D-type cyclins (CCNDs) hyper-phosphorylates Rb causing release of E2F to promote
  cell proliferation. MDM2: Mouse double minute 2 homolog; CDK4: Cyclin Dependent
  Kinase 4; TP53: tumor protein 53; CCNDs: D-type cyclins; Rb: Retinoblastoma protein;
  E2F: family of transcription factors; CDKN2A gen: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  2A p16INKAa: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A protein; p14ARF: ARF tumor suppressor
  (alternate reading frame protein product of the CDKN2A locus)'
