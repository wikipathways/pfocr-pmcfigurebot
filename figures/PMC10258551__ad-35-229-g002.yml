figure_title: 'N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) expression is critical for
  adipocyte differentiation in HemEC. (A) Heat map of the RNA-seq data for the top
  20 upregulated pathways in HemECs compared with HDMEC. Shown are heat maps for hypoxia
  genes including NDRG1. (B) To examine whether NDRG1 regulates IH involution to adipocyte
  differentiation, HemECs were transfected with NDRG1 and control siRNA (p=0.0029).
  (C) The knockdown of NDRG1 reduced the level of iPSC factor, c-Myc, but it did not
  affect the expression of SOX2. Protein levels and mRNA expression of c-Myc were
  downregulated in siNDRG1-transfected HemEC. mRNA expression measured by RT-PCR was
  graphed as the relative expression of siNDRG1-transfected HemEC, compared with those
  transfected with control siRNA. Heat map (right) of MYC genes for siNDRG1 transfected
  HemECs and siControl transfected HemECs. (D) Neutral lipid staining (Oil Red O)
  of siControl transfected HemECs and siNDRG1 transfected HemECs. Oil Red O stain
  in siRNA NDRG1-expressing cells compared to control cells. Scale bar=100 µm and
  20 µm. (E) Relative mRNA levels for indicated genes in differentiated control and
  siRNA NDRG1-expressing cells. Induction of C/Ebpα, FABP4, and leptin transcriptional
  factors are required for proper adipocyte differentiation. TGF-β signaling pathway
  functions as a key suppressor of the commitment phase of adipocyte differentiation.
  The knockdown of NDRG1 in HemECs has increased the mRNA expression of TGF-β. (F)
  Heat map of adipogenesis genes for siNDRG1 transfected HemECs and siControl transfected
  HemECs. One representative of 3 experiments is shown. The data represent the mean±standard
  error of mean. HemECs: hemangioma-derived endothelial cells, HDMEC: human dermal
  microvascular endothelial cell, siControl: small interfering control, siNDRG1: small
  interfering N-myc downstream regulated gene 1. Statistical analysis by a student
  t-test (*p<0.05, **p<0.001)'
