caption: GO, KEGG pathway, and PPI analysis results of differentially expressed N-glycoproteins
  in KBD vs. N. (A) GO analysis of the differentially expressed N-glycoproteins of
  cartilage in KBD vs. N. (B) Bubble diagram of KEGG pathways in KBD vs. N. The blue
  to red gradient of bubbles of KEGG pathways represents the significance from low
  to high, respectively. Bubble size represents the number of differentially expressed
  N-glycoproteins in the KEGG pathway. (C) PPI network between KBD and N. Rectangles
  represent KEGG pathways, and circles represent N-glycoproteins. Solid lines mean
  the relationship has been verified by research, dashed lines mean the relationship
  has not been verified. The yellow and blue colors of the N-glycoproteins represent
  up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively.
