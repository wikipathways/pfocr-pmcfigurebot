figure_title: Genes involved in gene regulation and development are enriched in accelerated
  PREs
caption: (A) The 5% of genes with the most acceleration events are enriched for GO
  terms related to gene regulation and development. Examples of highly enriched GO
  terms among the 5% genes with most acceleration events. For a full list see Tab.
  S6. Bottom, histogram showing the distribution of total acceleration events per
  gene, with the top 5% highlighted in dark blue. (B) TF genes are connected to more
  PREs than non-TF genes. Blue box, inter-quartile range with median indicated; whiskers,
  90% data interval. (C) TF genes have more acceleration events in their total collection
  of PREs than non-TF genes. (D) PREs of TF genes are more frequently accelerated
  than non-TF genes, although only slightly so. (E) Signaling pathways tend to be
  connected to large numbers of PREs. Histogram showing a resampling distribution
  for the numbers of PREs per gene for 50 random genes (Methods). Black bars show
  the average number of PREs per gene for selected signaling pathways. Dotted line,
  significance cutoff (PBH < 0.05) for resampling test. (F) Among those signaling
  pathways, Notch signaling stood out as showing a high number of total acceleration
  events per gene (PBH = 0.0090; statistics for other pathways are reported in Tab.
