figure_title: Antiviral effectors and cell metabolism interactions.
caption: Antiviral effectors and cell metabolism interactions. The binding of type
  I and III interferons (IFNs) to their respective receptors results, through the
  JAK/STAT pathway, in the nuclear translocation of ISGF3 and GAF factors. These factors
  interact with their respective promoters, ISRE and GAS, leading to the expression
  of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which act as effectors in the antiviral response.
  During viral infection, several of these ISGs have exhibited antiviral activity,
  whether during virus entry, replication, or assembly. Other ISGs, such as ISG15,
  play a role in promoting the antiviral response by enhancing the activity of certain
  factors involved in this response. Metabolism and the antiviral response are intricately
  linked, particularly in the expression of antiviral effectors. Oxidative phosphorylation,
  for instance, tends to enhance the expression of certain interferon-stimulated genes
  (ISGs) like ISG15, ISG54, or ISG56. However, a duality in this response appears
  to exist, as some genes encoding antiviral effectors are more expressed during aerobic
  glycolysis, suggesting they might serve as a backup mechanism in the event of metabolic
  reprogramming during infection
