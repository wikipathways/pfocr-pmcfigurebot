caption: Activation of AMPK by FA. (A) Western blot analysis of phosphorylation of
  the AMPK signaling pathway by FA (30 μM). The HepG2 cells were incubated with FA
  (30 μM) for 10 min to 6 h. Relative band intensity of AMPK. (B) Huh-7 cells were
  treated with FA (30 μM) for 10 min to 6 h. (C) Western blot analysis of LKB1 phosphorylation
  by FA (30 μM). HepG2 and Huh-7 cells were treated with FA (30 μM) for 10 min to
  6 h. (D) MTT assay of AA + iron-induced apoptosis of the HepG2 and LKB1-deficeint
  HeLa cells by FA (30 μM). The data represent the means ± S.D. of replicate experiments
  at least three times. The significance of the statistical differences between each
  treatment group and the vehicle-treated control group (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01)
  or AA + iron-induced group (## p < 0.01) was verified
