  complex.
caption: 'The signaling pathway, crystal structure and binding site of the CD47/CD172a
  complex. (A) The schematic diagram for CD47-CD172a axis. Interaction of CD47 and
  CD172a induces the phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) of SIRPα’s cytoplasmic domain. This event
  subsequently initiates the recruitment and activation of SHP1 and SHP2, leading
  to a signaling cascade that culminates in the dephosphorylation of myosin IIA and
  resulting in the inhibition of phagocytosis. Upregulation of CD47 expression is
  one of the mechanisms underlying the increased activity of the CD47-CD172a axis,
  while the post-translational modification of CD47 is involved in this aforementioned
  process, too. (B) The crystal structure of the complex of CD47 with CD172a. The
  crystal structure of the complex (PDB ID: 2JJT) is shown using a new cartoon representation.
  The CD47 extracellular IgV-like domain (in cyan) (the 1st–115th residue) is responsible
  for binding with CD172a. It contains three short β-strands (A, B and E), two helices,
  and five long β-strands (C, C′, C″, F and G) [17]. The first extracellular Ig subdomain
  (the 2nd–115th) (in orange) of CD172a binds to CD47, is consisting of eight β-strands
  (A, B, C, C″, D, E, F, G1, G2 and F) and their linker loops. The Cα-atom of pyroglutamic
  acid (green) at position 1 in the residue sequence of the wild-type (WT) CD47 is
  represented in van der Waals mode. The crystal structure of CD47 (in cyan) bound
  to CD172a (in orange) is shown in a new cartoon representation. (C–E) The binding
  site of CD47/CD172a complex. The labeled residues in CD47 or in the CD loop (C),
  DE loop (D) and FG loop (E) of CD172a were involved in binding to CD47'
