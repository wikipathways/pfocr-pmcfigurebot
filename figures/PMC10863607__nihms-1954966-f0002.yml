figure_title: Metabolic pathway associated with second trimester (T2) chemicals.
caption: Metabolic pathway associated with second trimester (T2) chemicals. Pathway
  enrichment analysis with metabolites of three network communities in Fig. 1 was
  conducted using mummichog. A) A total of seven pathways were found altered with
  m/z 315.1957 (F1) in C1, B) Eight pathways were altered with m/z 334.2090 (F2) in
  C2, and C) Seven pathways were altered with environmental chemicals and drug metabolites
  (F3-F7) (p < 0.05). The ratio of selected metabolites mapped to the listed pathway
  over the number of total pathway metabolites detected is provided to the right of
  each bar
