figure_title: Distinct immune responses in liver samples of mice with induced ASH
  and NASH after 7 weeks.
caption: 'Distinct immune responses in liver samples of mice with induced ASH and
  NASH after 7 weeks. (A) Heatmap of the detectable metabolites of the tryptophan
  metabolism in liver tissues 7 weeks after induction of ASH or NASH. Data are shown
  as fold changes compared to healthy mice (n = 8). Student’s t-test vs. healthy mice,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001. (B) Schematic illustration
  showing the regulated metabolites of the tryptophan metabolic pathway in liver samples
  of mice with NASH. Metabolites shown in blue are significantly downregulated, whereas
  metabolites in red are significantly upregulated as compared to healthy animals.
  Metabolites indicated in black show no significant changes. (C) Immune cell counts
  were determined using high-content immunohistochemistry in liver tissues from healthy
  mice and 7 weeks after induction of ASH or NASH. Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n
  = 6). Two-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001
  vs. healthy mice, # p < 0.05, #### p < 0.0001 ASH vs. NASH. n.d., not detected.
  (D,E) Representative images (panel D) and quantification (panel E) of M-like macrophages
  (F4 80+/CD86−/CD206+) in liver tissue 7 weeks after induction of ASH or NASH. Data
  are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 6). Unpaired Student’s t-test, ** p < 0.01. The white
  bar represents 50 mm'
