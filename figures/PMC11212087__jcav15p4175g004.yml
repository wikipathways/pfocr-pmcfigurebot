caption: Deciphering metabolic landscape of colorectal cancer patients at single-cell
  resolution (A) UMAP visualization of 22963 cells (13 cell types) across six CRC
  patients. (B) Bar plot showed the 13 cell proportion among patients. (C, D) Heatmap
  and Violin plot showed the markers of each cell type. (E) Heatmap displaying the
  activity of metabolic pathways in 13 different cell types. (F) Differential analysis
  of metabolic pathways revealed that 20 metabolic pathways were up-regulated in C3.
  The top 5 pathways in the -log10 (adj.P.val) ranking are highlighted in red. (G)
  Violin plots indicated the metabolic pathway activity of top5 in these cell types.
