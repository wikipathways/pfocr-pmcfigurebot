figure_title: Gene expression of the Wnt signaling pathway.
caption: 'Gene expression of the Wnt signaling pathway. Note: Figure (a) shows the
  mRNA expression level of the target gene, while Figure (b,c) present the protein
  expression and statistical analysis of the gene, respectively. Each experiment consists
  of 3 independent replicates, “**” indicates a very significant difference compared
  to the ZEA and CON groups (p < 0.01), and “##”denotes a very significant difference
  between the A2 group or A2+ZEA group and the ZEA group (p < 0.01)'
