figure_title: Identification and annotation of DEPs based on DIA proteomic data in
  poll glands during estrus.
caption: 'Identification and annotation of DEPs based on DIA proteomic data in poll
  glands during estrus. (A) Number of recognized precursors, peptides, and proteins.
  (B) Peptide number distribution and proportion of proteins. (C) The number of significantly
  upregulated and downregulated proteins in poll glands during vigorous estrus. (D)
  GO annotation and pathways of the 1703 DEPs. BP: biological process. MF: molecular
  function. CC: cellular component. (E) The top 50 enriched biological processes in
  GO annotations of the DEPs. (F) Top 20 enriched signaling pathways of the DEPs.
  Con: Poll glands group during indistinct estrus. Exp: Poll glands group during vigorous
  estrus. Statistical analyses: Wilcoxon rank sum test, Î± = 0.05'
