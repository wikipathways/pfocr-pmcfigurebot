figure_title: PN enhances Smad2/3 phosphorylation in HC-a.
caption: 'PN enhances Smad2/3 phosphorylation in HC-a. (A) Protein expression levels
  of p-Smad2/3 and (B) quantitative analysis, along with (C) immunofluorescence staining,
  demonstrate the impact of PN treatment on IL−1β-induced p-Smad2/3 protein expression
  in HC-a chondrocytes in the presence of the Smad2/3 inhibitor LY-364947 (bars =
  100 μm; original magnification × 20). (D) Protein expression levels and (E–G) quantitative
  analysis of pathway mediators, including TGF-β, COL2A1, and ACAN, were assessed
  to investigate the downstream effects of Smad2/3 inhibition using the LY-364947
  inhibitor. Results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) from three
  independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined as follows: ###
  p < 0.001, #### p < 0.0001 compared to the control group, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001,
  and **** p < 0.0001 compared to the IL−1β-treated group and @ p < 0.05, @@ p < 0.01,
  @@@ p < 0.001, and @@@@ p < 0.0001 compared to the PN treated group'
