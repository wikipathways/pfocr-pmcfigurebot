  through the MIF signaling pathway in low-HDS samples.
caption: CCL17+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells may inhibit T-cell and NK-cell infiltration
  through the MIF signaling pathway in low-HDS samples. (A) The tSNE analysis revealed
  reclustering maps of myeloid cells. (B) The bubble plot shows the expression of
  the defined gene in each cell cluster. (C) The bubble plot shows the marker genes
  for each cell cluster. (D) The difference in cell interaction number and strength
  in high- and low-HDS samples was analyzed based on CellChat. (E) Bubble plot showing
  upregulated signaling pathways in low-HDS tumors. (F) Violin diagram showing the
  expression levels of MIF signaling pathway-associated ligands and receptors in CCL17+
  pDCs, T cells, and NK cells. (G) KEGG demonstrates the capabilities of CCL17+ pDCs.
  (H) Correlation between the enrichment score of CCL17+ pDCs and the HDS (ACRG cohort).
  (I) Effect of the enrichment score of CCL17+ pDCs on the prognosis of gastric cancer
  (ACRG cohort)
