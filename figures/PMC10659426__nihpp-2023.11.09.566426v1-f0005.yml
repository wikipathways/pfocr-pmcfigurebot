figure_title: Genome-wide characterization of A-to-I editing in mouse kidneys
caption: (A) Pathway enrichment analysis based on genes that exhibit differential
  editing rates between baseline and 28 hours (cytoplasmic compartment). (B) Heatmap
  displaying the top 500 differentially expressed A-to-I editing sites between 0-hour
  baseline and 28 hours after endotoxin in the kidney. The differentially expressed
  sites are categorized based on repeat classes. (C) List of genes exhibiting non-synonymous
  A-to-I coding sequence mutation in response to an endotoxin challenge in the kidney.
  (D) Cdk13 reads distribution and A-to-I editing under the indicated conditions.
  (E) Comparison of motif enrichment between non-hyper-editing (top) and hyper-editing
  sites (bottom) within ±50 nucleotides centered around A-to-I editing sites. Predicted
  RNA secondary structure around the 3′UTR hyper-editing site is shown at the bottom
  (arrow). (F) Ribo-seq and Nanopore read coverage graphs for Adar, clarifying Adar
  transcript isoform switches during endotoxemia
