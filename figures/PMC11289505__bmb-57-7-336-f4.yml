caption: CDK10 inhibits cell growth and radioresistance through JNK/c-Jun signaling
  pathway. (A) H522 cells transfected with indicated siRNAs were collected for quantitative
  real-time PCR analysis. Mean ± SD, t test, ***P < 0.001. (B) Volcano plot shows
  the differentially downregulated and upregulated genes in different groups. Fold
  change ≥ 2, P < 0.05. (C) Bubble plot shows the statistics of pathway enrichment.
  (D) Cluster map shows the differentially expressed genes in the TNF signaling pathway.
  (E) H522 cells transfected with indicated siRNAs were collected to detect the indicated
  mRNA levels. Mean ± SD, t test, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (F) H522 cells transfected
  with the indicated siRNAs were collected for western blotting with the indicated
  antibodies. (G) H522 cells transfected with indicated siRNAs were analyzed by western
  blotting. (H) H522 cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs were cultured and
  counted. Mean ± SD, t test, ***P < 0.001. (I) The survival fraction showed the radiosensitivity
  in different groups. Mean ± SD, t test, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (J) Images and
  numbers of migrated H522 cells in different groups. Scale bar, 275 mm. Mean ± SD,
  t test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (K) A proposed model of how CDK10 regulates cell
  progression and radioresistance in lung cancer cells
