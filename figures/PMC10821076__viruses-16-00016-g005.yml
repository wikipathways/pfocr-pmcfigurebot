caption: Saucerneol induced the STING/TBK-1/IRF3 signaling pathway in Enterovirus
  71- and Coxsackievirus A16-infected cells. (A) Representative immunoblot results
  of STING, p-STING, TBK-1, p-TBK-1, IRF3, p-IRF3, and β-actin to evaluate activation
  of their expression in (A) EV71 and (B) CVA16 -infected Vero cells or uninfected
  cells after treatment with saucerneol (10 µg/mL). The samples were derived from
  the same experiment, and gels/blots were processed in parallel
