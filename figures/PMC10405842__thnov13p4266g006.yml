caption: Application of exosomes in peripheral nerve injury. (A) OGD-SC-Exos induced
  the mRNA expression of M1 macrophage markers (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in vivo and
  inhibited the neurites elongation of DRG neurons in vitro. Adapted with permission
  from 117, copyright 2023, Elsevier. (B) Exosomes derived from LPS-preconditioned
  MSCs promoted the shift of pro-inflammation macrophage into M2 macrophage phenotype
  through TSG-6 carried by exosomes inhibiting NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. Adapted
  with permission from 120, copyright 2022, Elsevier. (C) Exosomes derived from differentiated
  hADMSCs with the SCs phenotype attenuated the intracellular oxidative stress of
  primary SCs and enhanced the tube formation, migration of HUVECs. Adapted with permission
