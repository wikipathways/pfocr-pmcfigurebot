figure_title: Putative biosynthetic pathways of dendrobine in D.
caption: 'Putative biosynthetic pathways of dendrobine in D. nobile. A: the MVA (A)
  pathway. (B) the biosynthetic pathways of dendrobine and heat map of different genes.
  Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (AACT); 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- CoA synthase (HMGS);
  3-hydroxy- 3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR); mevalonic acid (MVA); mevalonate
  kinase (MK); mevalonate 5-phosphate (MVAP); phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK); mevalonate
  diphosphate (MVAPP); mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MVD); isopentenyl diphosphate
  (IPP); dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP); isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI);
  farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS); endoplasmic reticulum (ER); terpene synthase
  (TPS); cytochrome P450 oxidase (P450); NH2, amination reaction; and Me, methylation
  reaction. The expression levels of genes at the six time points are represented
  by heatmaps, in which the blocks shown from left to right represent CK, TC7, TC14,
  TF, TF7, and TF14'
