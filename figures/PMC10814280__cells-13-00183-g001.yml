figure_title: Mechanism of RABV-induced incomplete autophagy.
caption: 'Mechanism of RABV-induced incomplete autophagy. (1) RABV activates the initiation
  of autophagy. RABV activates the AMPK signaling pathway upon invasion. On the one
  hand, activated AMPK inhibits mTORC1, thus blocking the inhibition of mTORC1 on
  the ULK1 complex. On the other hand, AMPK can positively regulate two factors, AKT
  and MAPK, to activate the ULK1 complex and prompt the initiation of autophagy. In
  addition, the P protein of rabies virus binds to Beclin1 in the PI3KC3 complex and
  reduces the phosphorylation of CASP2, which not only positively regulates the AMPK
  signaling pathway but also negatively regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which
  activates the initiation of autophagy. (2) RABV prevents the fusion of autophagosome
  and lysosome: the P protein of RABV binds to Beclin1, wraps immature autophagosomes,
  inhibits the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome, and blocks the degradation of
  autophagosomes. (3) IFIM3 was able to directly inhibit the ULK1 complex and promote
  mTORC1 phosphorylation, indirectly inhibiting the ULK1 complex. Blocked the initiation
  of autophagy induced by RABV invasion'
