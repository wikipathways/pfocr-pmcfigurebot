caption: Lumbrokinase sensitized NSCLC cells to chemotherapeutics by targeting NF-κB/COX-2
  signaling. (A) The expression level of COX-2 in H460, H1299, and A549 cells treated
  with lumbrokinase for 48 h was analyzed by RT-PCR. (B) The expression level of COX-2
  in H460, H1299, and A549 cells treated with lumbrokinase for 48 h was analyzed by
  Western blot. (C) The level of PGE2 in the supernatants of H460 and H1299 cells
  treated with lumbrokinase for 48 h was measured by ELISA. (D) The chemotherapeutic
  sensitivity was tested by MTT assay in H1299 cells treated with/without lumbrokinase
  and/or CB. (E) The chemotherapeutic sensitivity was tested by MTT assay in H460
  cells treated with/without lumbrokinase and/or LPS. (F) The key proteins of the
  NF-κB pathway were detected in the cytoplasm or nucleus in NSCLC cells treated with
  different concentrations of lumbrokinase. (G) The distribution of p50 and p65 protein
  in NSCLC cells treated with different doses of lumbrokinase by immunofluorescence
  (magnification 200×). (H) Pull-down assay using a COX2 promoter probe was performed
  in H460 and H1299 cells under two doses of lumbrokinase treatment, and the p50 and
  p65 proteins were detected. (I) ChIP assay was performed using p50 and p65 antibodies
  or IgG in H460 and H1299 cells under two doses of lumbrokinase treatment. (J) The
  relative luciferase expression driven by the COX2 promoter in H460 and H1299 cells
  was detected upon lumbrokinase treatment. (K) The expression of COX2 in H460 cells
  treated with QNZ or PMA alone or its combination with lumbrokinase. The level of
  significance was indicated by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001, and ns
  means no statistical significance
