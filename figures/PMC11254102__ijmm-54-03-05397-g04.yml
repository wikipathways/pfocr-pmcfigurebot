figure_title: Validation of Salusin-α regulation of lipid metabolism via the LKB1/AMPK
  pathway by western blotting.
caption: 'Validation of Salusin-α regulation of lipid metabolism via the LKB1/AMPK
  pathway by western blotting. (A) After lentiviral transfection of HepG2 cells for
  24 h, western blotting was used to detect the expression of several proteins in
  the LKB1/AMPK downstream pathway. Expression of (B) p-LKB1/LKB1, (C) p-AMPK/AMPK,
  (D) SREBP-1c and (E) FASN in each group. (F) Lentiviruses were transfected for 24
  h and then cells were induced with FFA for 24 h. The bar graphs show the densitometric
  analysis of the western blots. (G-J) Expression of (G) p-LKB1/LKB1, (H) p-AMPK/AMPK,
  (I) SREBP-1c and (J) FASN in the different treatment groups. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SD. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. control; #P<0.05, ##P<0.01
  and ###P<0.001 vs. FFA group. LKB1, liver kinase B1; AMPK, adenosine 5′-monophosphate
  (AMP)-activated protein kinase; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c;
  FASN, fatty acid synthase; p-, phosphorylated; FFA, free fatty acid; sh-, short
  hairpin; ns, not significant'
