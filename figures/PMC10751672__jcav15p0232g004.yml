caption: GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of IGFBP5 and its 500 co-expressed genes
  in glioma patients. (A, B) The top 20 genes positively (A) and negatively (B) correlated
  with IGFBP5 were shown in heatmap in glioma. Data were normalized by Zscore standardization
  method. (C-E) Significant Gene Ontology terms of top 500 genes most positively associated
  with IGFBP5, including biological processes (C), cell component (D), and molecular
  function (E). (F) Top 15 KEGG enrichment pathways in glioma
