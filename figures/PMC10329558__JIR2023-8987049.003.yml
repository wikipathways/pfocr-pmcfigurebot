figure_title: iMSC-sEV ameliorated AMs inflammatory response and inhibited the NF-κB
  signaling pathway activation induced by LPS in vitro.
caption: iMSC-sEV ameliorated AMs inflammatory response and inhibited the NF-κB signaling
  pathway activation induced by LPS in vitro. (a) Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β,
  TNF-α, and IL-6 levels in the supernatant of AMs treated with iMSC-sEV. (b) Representative
  western blot and quantitative analysis of p-p65 and p65 in recipient AMs treated
  with iMSC-sEV. (c) Detection of the uptake effects of AMs on PKH-67-labelled iMSC-sEV
  by means of fluorescent microscopy. Data presented as mean ± SD.  ∗∗P < 0.01,  ∗∗∗P
  < 0.001 compared within two groups. n = 3 per group
