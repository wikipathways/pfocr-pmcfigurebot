  cancer cell lines.
caption: SHP2 is a potential therapeutic target for vemurafenib-resistant thyroid
  cancer cell lines. A Simplified diagram of the construction process of drug-resistant
  cell lines. B Vemurafenib IC50 detection by CCK-8 assay in BCPAP-R and K-1-R cells.
  C SHP2 was significantly activated in BCPAP-R and K-1-R cell lines were significantly
  activated. Analysis by western blotting within 48 h of two vemurafenib resistance
  models were treated with DMSO, SHP099 (10 μM), vemurafenib (5 μM) or combination
  (SHP099 + vemurafenib) for activation of MAPK signaling pathway. D Cell proliferation
  detection by colony-formation assay in BCPAP-R and K-1-R cell lines. E Cell viability
  detection by CCK-8 assay in BCPAP-R and K-1-R cell lines. F The cell cycle distribution
  detection by flow cytometric assay in BCPAP-R and K-1-R cell lines. BCPAP-R and
  K-1-R cell lines were treated with DMSO, SHP099 (10 μM), vemurafenib (5 μM) or combination
  (SHP099 + vemurafenib), respectively. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. All data
  are expressed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments
