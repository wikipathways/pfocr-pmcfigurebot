caption: (A) Bar graph of DEM multiplicity, presenting the top 20 metabolites with
  the highest difference in multiplicity. (B) The top 10 enriched KEGG pathways of
  DEMs displayed by p-value in the oridonin and control groups (p < 0.05, VIP > 1).
  (C) Correlation analysis among samples. The top 20 differential metabolites with
  the highest VIP values are included. (D) Violin plot showing the top 20 DEMs based
  on VIP values
