caption: NF-κB signaling pathway inhibition rescued TGF-β1-induced fibrosis and pyroptosis
  in vitro. (A) Protein expression levels of NLRP3, GSDMD, ASC, and IL1-β in cells
  after the addition of the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 were detected by Western blotting.
  (B) Expression levels of fibronectin and vimentin in cells after the addition of
  the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 were detected by Western blotting. (C) Western blot analysis
  of changes in the expression levels of P-P65/P65, fibronectin, and vimentin in cells
  treated with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082. (D) Protein expression levels of NLRP3,
  GSDMD, ASC, and IL1-β in cells treated with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 were
  detected by Western blotting. The data are presented as the mean ± SD; * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, ns, not significant
