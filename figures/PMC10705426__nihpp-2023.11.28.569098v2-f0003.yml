figure_title: Oxphos state exhibits substantial cell line-to-cell line heterogeneity
  independent of cancer type
caption: (A) Metabolic pathways enriched in genes with highest contribution (determined
  by PCA) to the metabolic heterogeneities among individual cell lines from different
  cancer types. Data are clustered based on −log10(FDR) values derived from gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA). Pairs of pathway/cancer type with significant cell line-to-cell
  line heterogeneity (FDR ≤ 0.05) are highlighted with an asterisk (*). (B) Metabolic
  pathways ranked according to the percent of cancer types showing significant cell
  line-to-cell line heterogeneity. (C) Distinct patterns of cell line-to-cell line
  variability in two representative metabolic pathways, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism
  (left) and oxidative phosphorylation (right), across indicated cancer types. Mean
  pathway transcript per million (TPM) levels, their median and interquartile ranges
  (IQR) across cell lines are highlighted. (D) Single-cell analysis of Oxphos state
  based on single-cell RNA sequencing data from representative pancreatic adenocarcinoma
  (left) and colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (right). Mean counts per million
  (CPM) scores for Oxphos genes were calculated for each single cell. The arbitrary
  threshold of 200 CPM (red dotted line) was used to separate OxphosHigh and OxphosLow
  cells
