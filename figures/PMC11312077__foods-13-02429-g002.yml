  DGAT, ACC, and FASN in MECs after (a) 5 or 24 h of exposure to 0.
caption: Gene expression levels of de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway genes, DGAT,
  ACC, and FASN in MECs after (a) 5 or 24 h of exposure to 0.2 or 1 μg of LPS or (b)
  24 h of exposure to 0.5 mM H2O2. Significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) are indicated
  with different letters or asterisks. Uppercase or lowercase letters are used for
  comparing results between treatments within the same time frame (5 or 24 h)
