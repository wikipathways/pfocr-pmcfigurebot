figure_title: KEGG classification (up) and enrichment scatterplot (down) of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in PFE_vs_NFE (a), PFG_vs_NFG (b), PFH_vs_NFH (c).
caption: KEGG classification (up) and enrichment scatterplot (down) of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in PFE_vs_NFE (a), PFG_vs_NFG (b), PFH_vs_NFH (c). The abscissa
  of the scatterplot is the enrichment factor, which represents the ratio of the number
  of target genes divided by the number of all the genes in each pathway. The larger
  the enrichment factor, the more significant the enrichment level of DEGs in this
  pathway. The color of the dot represents the q value, and the size of the dot represents
  the number of DEGs in the pathway. The same below
