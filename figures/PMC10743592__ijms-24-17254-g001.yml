caption: Presentation of the effects of ghrelin on pyroptosis. When ghrelin binds
  to its receptor, the hormone can inhibit pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is divided into
  two pathways—the canonical pathway and the non-canonical pathway. In the canonical
  pathway, ghrelin can decrease the levels of inflammasome consisting of caspase-1,
  sensor proteins and ACS, active caspase-1, cytokines IL-1β/IL-18, and N-GSDMD. In
  the non-canonical pathway, the level of N-GSDMD can be affected. These arrows all
  show that the levels of these molecules decrease. The figure is made using Biorender
