  SS
caption: 'Groups were divided into four groups: C57BL/6, NOD, NOD + 5 mg/kg SB202190,
  NOD + 5 mg/kg SB202190 + 50 mg/kg Shikonin. (A) Salivary flow (mg/10 min) was examined.
  ***p < 0.001 vs. the C57BL/6 group, ###p < 0.001 vs. the NOD group, ^^^p < 0.001
  vs. the NOD + 5 mg/kg SB202190 group. (B) The salivary gland index (mg/g) and spleen
  index (mg/g) were measured. (C) ELISA was used to verify the levels of TNF-α, IL-6,
  IL-17, and IL-4. (D) Flow cytometry was used to detect the percentages of CD4+,
  CD8+, and B220+CD19+ cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Values are presented
  as mean ± SD. SS, Sjögren syndrome; NOD, non-obese diabetic'
