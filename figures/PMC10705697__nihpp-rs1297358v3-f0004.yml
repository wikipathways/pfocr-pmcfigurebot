figure_title: AC004540.4 promotes cell survival pathways and can be targeted to induce
  apoptosis
caption: a) A volcano plot from RNAseq derived data highlights the differentially
  expressed (DE) genes from D04 cells treated with either AC004540.4 ASO, or Control
  ASO. Cut-off for significance was p < 0.05 and either < −1.5 (downregulated) or
  > 1.5 (upregulated) log2fold expression level change (n=3). DAVID functional annotation
  clustering unveiled that "PI3K-AKT signaling pathway" (downregulated), and "protein
  tyrosine kinase activity" and "Ras guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity" (upregulated)
  were Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathways found in the top enriched clusters. b)Peptide-associated
  phosphorylation profiles of melanoma cell lines treated with AC004540.4 ASO, or
  Control ASO. Unsupervised clustering was applied (using uncentered correlation and
  average linkage for both peptides/horizontal and samples/vertical). The profile
  of each sample is the average of two independent assay repeats. c) Unsupervised
  clustering of kinase activity signatures from results shown in previous panel. Kinases
  for which ≥3 biological peptides are available, are shown. AC004540.4 inhibition
  induced a conserved response across cell lines of either activity downregulation
  (Block A, mainly blue) and upregulation (Block B, mainly yellow). d)Kinase activity
  profiles of a subset of kinases known to promote cell survival by preventing apoptosis
  is specifically downregulated by AC004540.4 ASO treatment, as shown by a side-by-side
  comparison to the effects of inhibiting the distinct pro-oncogenic lncRNA MALAT1
  with MALAT1 ASO treatment. e) The specificity of the effects of AC004540.4 ASO treatment
  on the kinase activity signatures of melanoma cells is assessed in comparison to
  MALAT1 ASO treatment using Pearson correlation. f) As measured by activity levels
  of the apoptosis markers Caspase-3 & -7, AC004540.4 ASO treatment induces apoptosis
  to a significantly stronger extent than MALAT1 ASO treatment in the D04 (3-fold
  VS 1.6-fold, p < 0.002) and MM415 (3.5-fold VS 1.1-fold, p < 0.006) cell-line, when
  compared to Control ASO treatment (treatment with 50 nM ASO concentration for 1
  day, n=4). Significance is shown as p-values calculated by Student’s t-test. * =
  p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001. Error bars represent the standard deviation.
  g) Dot plot graph of flow cytometric analysis of PI and Annexin V staining after
  1 day of ASO-treatment shows increased apoptotic cell death in D04-cells treated
  with AC004540.4 ASO compared to Control ASO treatment. Numbers in quadrants (red)
  show the percentage of vital (bottom left), early apoptotic (bottom right), late
  apoptotic (top right) and dead (top left) cells relative to the overall population.

  inducing apoptosis and inhibiting pro-oncogenic kinases in melanoma
