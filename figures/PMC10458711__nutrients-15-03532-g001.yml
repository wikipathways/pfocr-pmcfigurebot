figure_title: The taurine biosynthetic enzyme Ado is potently upregulated in inguinal
  adipose tissue in response to β3 adrenergic activation of NST.
caption: The taurine biosynthetic enzyme Ado is potently upregulated in inguinal adipose
  tissue in response to β3 adrenergic activation of NST. (A) Schematic of thermogenesis
  activation experiment in wild-type (WT) male mice (n = 4). (B) Schematic representation
  of the taurine biosynthetic pathway. (C–F) Representative Western blot of IWAT,
  BAT, EWAT, and liver tissues from mice injected with CL or saline for 7 days (n
  = 4). β-Actin, Gapdh, and Hsc70 are the protein loading controls. Densitometry of
  Cdo, Csad, and Ado protein levels normalized to β-Actin, Gapdh, or Hsc70 are shown
  on the right. (G–J) Relative mRNA expression of Ucp1, Cdo, Csad, and Ado from WT
  mice injected with CL or saline for 7 days in different adipocytes and liver (n
  = 4). All figures and data are represented as mean ± SEM. Significance is expressed
  as * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 by Student’s t-test
