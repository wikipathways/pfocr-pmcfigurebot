caption: Schematic representation of the TLR4/MD2/AMPK pathway. Stimulation of TLR4/MD2
  by FFA and LPS or of TNFR1 by TNFα on hepatocytes inhibits the phosphorylation of
  AMPK through TBK‐1. AMPK inhibition promotes hepatic steatosis through increased
  de novo lipogenesis and suppressed fatty acid oxidation. In addition, liver‐specific
  AMPK can reduce adiposity and decrease levels of leptin and resistin, and thus,
  AMPK inhibition can further increase obesity, inflammation and NAFLD through a vicious
  cycle. AMPK, AMP‐activated protein kinase; FFA, free fatty acids; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  MD2, myeloid differentiation factor 2; Srebp1, sterol regulatory element binding
  protein 1; TBK‐1, TANK binding protein‐1; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TRIF, TIR‐domain‐containing
  adapter‐inducing IFN‐β; TLR4, toll‐like receptor 4
article_title: MD2 AMP(K)s up the link between lipid accumulation and inflammation
  in NAFLD.
