caption: Analysis of metabolic pathways represented in the metabolic profiles of methanol
  biomass extracts of aged cultures of six microalgae strains. (a) Metabolic pathway
  enrichment and topology analyses using MetaboAnalyst (v5.0) and KEGG (see Section
  2). Size is proportional to the impact value, and the key, âˆ’log10 (p value), indicates
  the threshold for statistically significant enrichment of a metabolic pathway. Only
  pathways with an impact value of 0.1 or higher in at least one species are shown.
  (b) Schematic representation of a portion of the isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis
  pathway based on the KEGG database and KEGG reference number for the intermediates.
  (c) Heatmap of the normalized peak areas of intermediaries in (b), detected in the
  metabolomic profiling of the methanol extracts from biomass of strains 1798, 124,
  162, 3054, 1230, and 1602
