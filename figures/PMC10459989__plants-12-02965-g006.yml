caption: 'The expression patterns of validated genes involved in four prominent pathways
  associated with plant immunity by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).
  (a) Genes involved in calcium signaling pathways; (b) genes involved in ETI signaling
  pathways; (c) genes involved in the PTI signaling pathway; (d) genes involved in
  the SA signaling pathway. The data were calculated by the method of 2−ΔΔCT. The
  error bars indicate the standard deviation (STDEV) of the mean expression values.
  All data represent the mean of 3 biological replicates. Significant differences
  were denoted as follows ‘*’: (p ≤ 0.05)'
