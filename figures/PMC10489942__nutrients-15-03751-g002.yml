figure_title: Modulation of PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/GSK-3β signaling pathways by Avn.
caption: 'Modulation of PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/GSK-3β signaling pathways by Avn. PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases
  (PI3Ks); AKT: Ak strain transforming-Phosphokinase B; GSK3β: Glycogen synthase kinase
  3β; Nrf2: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; ARE: Antioxidant response
  element; Keap1: Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; RTK: Receptor tyrosine kinase.
  Oxidative stress limits the action of PI3K/AKT, and thereby activates GSK3β, thus
  inhibiting Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus, leading to downregulation of expression
  of cytoprotective enzymes. Avn-C acts as an electrophile that interacts with Keap,
  resulting in loss of inhibitory control and translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus
  and activating ARE for transcription of the antioxidant enzyme. Avn-C can also activate
  Nrf2 indirectly by inhibiting GSK3β'
