figure_title: KEGG analysis of DEIRGs enrichments.
caption: KEGG analysis of DEIRGs enrichments. (A), Bubble chart shows KEGG enrichment
  significance items of DEIRGs. (B), Bubble plot com-bined with Sankey diagram demonstrating
  the enriched KEGG pathways. The KEGG analysis indicated that DEIRGs were mainly
  enriched in cytokineâ€“cytokine receptor interaction, TNF signaling pathway, and proteoglycans
  in cancer. Gene ratio and pathways are represented by the x-axis and y-axis, respectively;
  the size and color of the dots indicate the gene count and the level of p value,
  respectively
