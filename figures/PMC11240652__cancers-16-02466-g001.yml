caption: HER2 signaling pathway. Human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs),
  including HER1 (EGFR), HER2, HER3 and HER4, are receptors that are characterized
  by extracellular ligand-binding domains, transmembrane domains and intracellular
  tyrosine kinase domains. Upon binding of specific ligands, the receptors undergo
  activation via phosphorylation. Notably, HER2 does not require ligand binding for
  activation. Dimerization triggers subsequent phosphorylation events, initiating
  downstream signaling cascades, such as the PI3K/AKT and RAF/MEK/MAPK pathways. Activation
  of these pathways is linked with cell survival, proliferation and progression through
  the cell cycle. This network of molecular interactions regulates critical cellular
  processes, contributing to cancer development [6]. Image created with BioRender.com
