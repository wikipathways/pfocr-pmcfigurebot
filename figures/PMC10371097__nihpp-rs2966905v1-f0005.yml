figure_title: PRMT5 inhibition results in Pol II Ser2 hyperphosphorylation and intron
  retention of cell cycle regulating genes
caption: 'A) Venn diagram of Pol II pSer2 peaks identified by ChIP-seq in MCF-7_RBKO
  cells treated with 500 nM pemrametostat (Pem) or vehicle (Veh) for 72 hours (n =
  2). B) Heatmap displaying Pol II pSer2 binding intensity based on ChIP-seq in MCF-7_RBKO
  cells. TSS: transcription start sites; TES: transcription end sites. C) Differences
  in percentage spliced in index (ΔPSI) between Pem and Veh treated MCF-7_RBKO cells.
  Analysis was conducted using SUPPA2 with RNA-seq data from MCF-7_RBKO cells treated
  with 500 nM Pem or Veh for 72 hours (n = 3). AF: alternative first exon; AL: alternative
  last exon; A3SS: alternative 3’ splice-site; A5SS: alternative 5’ splice-site; MXE,
  mutually exclusive exon; IR, intron retention; SE: skipped exon. Vertical lines
  within boxes represent median, edges of boxes represent the first or fourth quartiles,
  and whiskers represent the minimum or maximum values, outliers (greater or less
  than 1.5× interquartile range) were excluded. D) IR events identified using IRFinder.
  The analysis was conducted with the same dataset as described in (C). Transcripts
  with significant changes in IR were stratified based on whether their corresponding
  genes gained (red) or not (green) Pol II pSer2 chromatin bindings upon treatment
  of pemrametostat. E-F) Reactome pathway analysis using the gene stratification as
  described in (D). Pathway enrichment of genes that gained or not Pol II pSer2 chromatin
  bindings was shown in (E) and (F), respectively. G) Visualization of genes enriched
  for cell cycle pathway as described in (E). Color code represents differential gene
  expression of Pem vs Veh. H) Schematic of representative genes with IR induced by
  Pem. Upper left numbers denote exon/intron coverage on the same scale for each gene.
  X axis denotes genomic coordinates. I) Immunoblot analysis of MCF-7_RBKO lysates.
  Cells were treated with different concentrations of Pem for 3 days. Lysates were
  collected and subjected to immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. J) Schematic
  of the proposed model'
