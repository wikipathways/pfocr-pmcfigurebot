caption: Changes of hepatocyte viability and the PTEN/AKT/NFκB signaling pathway.
  (A) Selection of the optimal concentration of THP for hepatocyte treatment. (B)
  Under the condition of 5 µmol/l THP treatment, the optimal concentration of Sc for
  hepatocyte treatment was selected. (C) Effects of THP, Sc and Lentivirus on the
  viability of hepatocytes. (D) The effect of THP, Sc and Lentivirus on the p65, AKT,
  PTEN and IκBα protein expression in hepatocytes. (E-H) Semi-quantitative analysis
  of (E) PTEN, (F) AKT, (G) p65 and (H) IκBα protein expression. (I) The effect of
  THP, Sc and Lentivirus on the nucleus p65 protein expression in hepatocytes. (J)
  Semi-quantitative analysis of nucleus p65 protein expression. Values are expressed
  as the mean ± SEM. *P<0.05. THP, pirarubicin; Sc, scutellarein; p-, phosphorylated
