figure_title: Effect of oxaliplatin on the RNA transcription of 75 metabolic DEGs
  the heart
caption: 'A: Top 20 processes from the GO pathway enrichment analysis of 75 differentially
  expressed energy-related genes in the heart. B: Protein-protein interaction network
  and extracted 4 MCODE components/clusters. Network of enriched terms: (a) colored
  by cluster ID, where nodes that share the same cluster ID are typically close to
  each other; (b) colored by p-value, where terms containing more genes tend to have
  a more significant p-value. Cluster 1: Acaa2, Acadm, Acads, Acadvl, Cpt2, Decr1,
  Eci1, Ech1, Hadh, Hadhb, Hadha, Ivd; Cluster 2: Adpat 1, Agpat 2, Bcat1,Cth, Eno1,
  Pgam1, Pfkp; Cluster 3: Ndufs2, Nd6, Nd4l, Nd4, Cox2; Cluster 4: Bcat2, Pfkm, Hk1'
