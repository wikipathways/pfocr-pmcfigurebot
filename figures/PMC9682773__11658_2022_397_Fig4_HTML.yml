caption: AhR regulates adipocyte differentiation by regulating the PPAR signaling
  pathway, which plays a vital role in modulating fatty acid oxidation and glucose
  metabolism. Dioxins, such as TCDD, bind to AhR, inducing receptor activation that
  evokes many biological and toxicological effects. These environmental toxins bioaccumulate
  within human and animal adipose tissues, leading to inflammation and subsequently
  impairing insulin resistance. Furthermore, the formation of AhR–ARNT complexes interferes
  with the signaling of several pathways. TCDD-induced activation of AhR further causes
  dysregulation of lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissue, regulating adipocyte
  differentiation and interfering in the PPAR-α signaling pathway critical in fatty
  acid oxidation and glucose metabolism. Additionally, a TCDD-induced increase in
  the expression of TNF-α has been shown to exacerbate the dysfunction of insulin
  signaling and insulin resistance. Created by bioRender.com
