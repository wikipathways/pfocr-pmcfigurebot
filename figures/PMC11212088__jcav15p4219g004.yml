caption: 'Monocyte signaling pathway activity and metabolic activity. (A) UMAP plot
  showing the difference in the distribution of monocyte subpopulations in HCC versus
  PC, except for Unknown and Macrophages, where monocytes were further categorized
  into Classical Monocytes, Non-Classical Monocytes, and Intermediate Monocytes. (B)
  Bar graph demonstrating the percentage of monocyte subpopulations in the combined
  HCC and PC samples. (C) Bar graph demonstrating the percentage of monocyte subpopulations
  of HCC and PC sample tissues. (D-E) UMAP plots presenting the developmental trajectory
  tree of monocyte subpopulations. (F) Differences in CD14, CD83, CDDKN1A, COD2 with
  cell development in HCC and PC. (G) The proposed temporal changes of the top 10
  genes ranked by the Moran index with cell development. (H) Heatmap format visualizing
  the ITGB2 signaling network with Classical Monocytes and Non-Classical Monocytes
  as the main emitters (I) Bubble diagram showing the signaling pathway between monocyte
  subpopulations, Non-Classical Monocytes were found to be active in the MIF pathway
  (J) Violin graph demonstrates the receptor expression of the ITGB2 signaling pathway,
  and only Intermediate Monocytes specifically express ICAM1.(K) Monocyte GSEA: Oxidative
  phosphorylation, Ribosome expression is upregulated; while Bile secretion, Autoimmune
  thyroid disease were downregulated.'
