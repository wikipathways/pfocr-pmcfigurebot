caption: KEGG pathway analysis of DEPs after treatment with different concentrations
  of boron. The enriched signaling pathway of DEPs is exhibited in the lower axis
  and the proportion of DEPs (âˆ’log10 (p-value)) is listed in the upper axis. (A) Pathway
  analysis of DEPs between NC and B10 groups. (B) Pathway analysis of DEPs between
  NC and B320 groups. (C) Pathway analysis of DEPs between B10 and B320 groups
