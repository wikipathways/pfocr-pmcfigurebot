figure_title: DLBCL-derived exosomal ENO2 regulated macrophages polarization via GSK3β/β-catenin/c-Myc
  signaling pathway.
caption: DLBCL-derived exosomal ENO2 regulated macrophages polarization via GSK3β/β-catenin/c-Myc
  signaling pathway. THP-1 macrophages were treated with ICG001 or SKL2001 for 1 h
  and then stimulated by exosomes from DLBCL cells for 24 h. Macrophages polarization
  markers were detected. A. mRNA levels of IL-10, TGF-β, IL-12p40, and TNF-α in THP-1
  macrophages. B. IL-10 and IL-12p40 levels in supernatant of THP-1 macrophages. C.
  Proportion of CD68+CD206+THP-1 macrophages and quantification analysis. Data were
  shown as the mean±SD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001
