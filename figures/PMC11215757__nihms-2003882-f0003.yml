figure_title: Production of hiPSC-ECs
caption: (A) Protocol for the differentiation timeline for making vascular hiPSC-ECs
  from hiPSCs. This small molecule-mediated differentiation approach involves modulation
  of the Wnt signaling pathway and MACS separation for the positive selection of CD144+
  hiPSC-ECs. Schematic made with BioRender. (B) Phase contrast image of hiPSC-ECs.
  (C) Immunofluorescence staining of hiPSC-ECs illustrates canonical vascular endothelial
  markers CD31 (PECAM-1) and CD144 (VE-cadherin), as well as the nucleus stained with
  DAPI.
