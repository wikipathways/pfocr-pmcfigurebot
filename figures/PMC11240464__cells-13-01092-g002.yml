figure_title: RA regulates spermatogenesis.
caption: 'RA regulates spermatogenesis. (A): at the differentiation stage. RA can
  stimulate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR kinase signaling pathway [53]. RA can also induce KL
  and BMP4 expression to promote differentiation [56]. RA binds to RARG and further
  induces the expression of Kit and Stra8 genes [51,57]. NANOS2 can silence Stra8,
  a gene involved in spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis, and RA can promote
  spermatogonial differentiation by inhibiting NANOS2 [58]. RA promoted spermatogonial
  differentiation by inhibiting Lin28-induced Mirlet7-miRNA expression [61,62]. RA
  can also down-regulate the members of miR-17-92 and miR-106b-25 clusters [63]. (B):
  at the meiosis stage. RA directly stimulates Kit phosphorylation to make it active,
  which regulates DNA synthesis in mitosis and spermatogonia into meiosis through
  MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways [65]. During meiosis, MEIOSIN is also a downstream
  target of RA, and RA can activate MEIOSIN expression [66]. RA activates key genes
  involved in meiosis through its receptors RARs and RXRs, such as Msh5, Prdm9 and
  Sycp3 [67,68]. RA can also rapidly activate protein kinase c and transmit the activation
  signal to CREB through the ras/erk/rsk pathway without the pathway of RA-related
  receptors [69]. (C): at the formation and release stage. RA can participate in the
  process of sperm release by regulating the protein E-MAP-115 [70]. Similar to the
  differentiation stage, RA can also stimulate the expression of Stra8 in spermatogonia
  and reduce the expression of Nanos2 [71,72]. In addition, TSPO expression was significantly
  reduced during RA-induced differentiation [73]'
