figure_title: EGCG inhibits IPF-associated changes in biopsy AEC2s
caption: (A) Dimensional reduction plot of nonciliated epithelial subtypes from donors
  (10,127 cells, n = 14), untreated biopsy (10,336 cells, n = 4), and EGCG biopsy
  samples (11,585 cells, n = 4). (B) AEC2s as percentages of nonciliated epithelium.
  (C) Heatmap of selected top up- and downregulated upstream IPA pathways from untreated
  biopsy versus donor and EGCG biopsy versus untreated biopsy comparisons in AEC2s.
  (D and E) NicheNet prediction of differential receptor-ligand signaling from fibroblasts
  to AEC2s as a result of EGCG. Blue stars highlight AEC2 trophic factors increased
  in EGCG biopsy samples, and red stars highlight profibrotic pathways decreased in
  EGCG biopsy samples. Statistical significance was determined by Šídák’s multiple-comparisons
  test (B)
