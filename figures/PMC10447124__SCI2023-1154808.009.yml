figure_title: (a) ALP staining showing the changes of the osteogenic effects induced
  by CGRP after adding p38 inhibitor SB203580 (7 days); (b) the changes of the expression
  of osteogenic-related genes in rBMMSCs treated with CGRP after adding p38 inhibitor
  SB203580 by PCR.
caption: (a) ALP staining showing the changes of the osteogenic effects induced by
  CGRP after adding p38 inhibitor SB203580 (7 days); (b) the changes of the expression
  of osteogenic-related genes in rBMMSCs treated with CGRP after adding p38 inhibitor
  SB203580 by PCR. The expression changes of ALP, RUNX2, OCN, and OPN in rBMMSCs after
  7 days' treatment (SB refers to SB203580 ( ∗p < 0.05); (c) expression levels of
  p38 pathway and osteogenic related proteins in rBMMSCs treated with CGRP after adding
  p38 inhibitor SB203580 by western blot. The phosphorylation levels of the p38 MAPK
  pathway and expression levels of RUNX2 protein with or without SB203580
