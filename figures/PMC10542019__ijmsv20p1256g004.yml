caption: High lactate is necessary for mtDNA damage and subsequent pathway activation.
  (A) Western blot analysis showed that cGAS-STING and subsequent pathway activation
  in A253 cells were attenuated after incubation with 15 mM DCA for 24 h. (B) Western
  blot analysis showed that cGAS-STING and subsequent pathway activation in A253 cells
  were attenuated after incubation with 1 μg/mL EtBr for 48 h. (C) Western blot showing
  that after incubation with 4 mM PF-09628215 for 1 h before lactate treatment, the
  activation of cGAS-STING and subsequent pathways in A253 cells were weakened after
  addition of lactate for another 24 h. (D) Western blot analysis showed that after
  exogenous mtDNA was transferred into cells, the activation of cGAS-STING and subsequent
  pathways changed over time
