figure_title: A schematic illustration of the activation process of TLR receptors
  and their downstream signaling molecules upon activation forming the TLR-MYD88-IRAK1/4-TRAF6-NF-κB/IRF
  or TLR3/TLR4-TRIF-IRF/NF-κB signaling pathways.
caption: A schematic illustration of the activation process of TLR receptors and their
  downstream signaling molecules upon activation forming the TLR-MYD88-IRAK1/4-TRAF6-NF-κB/IRF
  or TLR3/TLR4-TRIF-IRF/NF-κB signaling pathways. The illustration also includes the
  location of common mammalian TLRs, either on the cell membrane or within the cell
  compartments (Endosome), and their corresponding ligands or agonists. Created with
