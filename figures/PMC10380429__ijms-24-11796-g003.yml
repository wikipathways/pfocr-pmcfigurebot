caption: Analysis of the regulation mechanism of cell stiffness in SKOV3 and ES-2
  cells. (A) Heatmap of DEGs (SKOV3 vs. ES-2 cells) in the cytoskeletal signaling
  pathway. (B) Fluorescence images of F-actin in SKOV3 and ES-2 cells. SKOV3 and ES-2
  cells were labeled with FITC-conjugated phalloidin. Then, the images of SKOV3 and
  ES-2 cells were taken using a Leika fluorescence microscope. (C–F) Young′s modulus
  with Gaussian fit function for SKOV3, ES-2 and treated with blebbitatin cells. (G)
  Box chart of modulus values for SKOV3, ES-2 and treated with blebbitatin cells.
  Horizontal lines in every box representing the average values. Each value indicates
  the mean ± SD of results obtained from three independent experiments. * p < 0.05.
  (H) Force–distance curves in SKOV3, ES-2 and treated with blebbitatin cells. Force–distance
  curves directly from cell cultured in Petri dishes at 25 °C by AFM. The number of
  cells tested in each condition ranged from 6 to 8, with over 550 force–displacement
  curves generated per condition. (I) The regulation mechanism of cell stiffness in
  SKOV3 and ES-2 cells
