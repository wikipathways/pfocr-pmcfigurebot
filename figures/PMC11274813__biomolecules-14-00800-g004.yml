caption: 'The KEGG analysis of DEPs. Amongst the most significantly enriched KEGG
  signaling pathways, differential protein expression patterns emerged (upregulated:
  A; downregulated: B). Notably, the MAPK signaling pathway exhibited a pronounced
  association with downregulated proteins (C; indicated in blue)'
