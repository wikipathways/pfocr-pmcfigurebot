figure_title: Transmethylation pathway.
caption: 'Transmethylation pathway. S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) catalyzes
  the reversible reaction which converts S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to homocysteine
  and adenosine (Ado). Ado can be phosphorylated to AMP by adenosine kinase (ADK).
  Methionine synthase (MetS) converts homocysteine into methionine. Methionine adenosyl
  transferase (MetAT) catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is
  the donor of the methyl group in the transmethylation reactions catalyzed by methyltransferases
  (MethylT). X: acceptor of the methyl group. SAH is an inhibitor of MethylT (dashed
  line). THF: tetrahydrofolate; PPi: inorganic pyrophosphate; Pi: inorganic phosphate'
