figure_title: Generation and identification of multigene-transgenic plants.
caption: Generation and identification of multigene-transgenic plants. (A) Transgenic
  D. catenatum plantlets of SG-multigene (11-month-old) and EV control (13-month-old).
  (B) Analysis of the hptII transgene in SG-multigene and EV control transgenic D.
  catematum plantlets. DNA isolated from wild-type plants was used as the negative
  control “−”, while the hptII gene in the EV plasmid was used as the positive control
  “+”. DcActin was PCR amplified to demonstrate an equal amount of loading. nptII
  was amplified to avoid bacterial contamination. (C) FPPS expression was checked
  to demonstrate activation of the dendrobine synthesis pathway. EV transgenic D.
  catenatum served as the control (Ctrl). (D) SG-transgenic D. catenatum grown in
  pine-bark pots for 10 months. (E) Molecular characterization of the hptII transgene
  in SG-transgenic D. catenatum grown in pine-bark pots. (F) Molecular characterization
  of the hptII transgene in SG-transgenic Arabidopsis. (G) Expression analysis of
  individual genes in SG-transgenic Arabidopsis by qRT-PCR. Scale bar in (A) represents
  1 cm. **** p ≤ 0.0001 represents significance
