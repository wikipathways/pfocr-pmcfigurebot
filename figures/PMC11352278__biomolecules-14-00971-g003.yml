caption: 'The biosynthetic pathway of α-santalene and α-santalols in S. cerevisiae.
  The black arrows represent the steps catalyzed by native enzymes, and the red arrows
  represent the steps catalyzed by exogenous enzymes. Meanwhile, the dashed arrow
  represents a step that is depressed. (ERG10: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; ERG13: HMG-CoA
  synthase; HMG-CoA: 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-gluraryl-CoA; tHMG1 and tHMG2: a truncated
  HMG-CoA reductase; ERG12: mevalonate-5-kinase; ERG8: phosphomevalonate kinase; ERG19:
  mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase; ERG20: (E, E)- FPP synthase; ERG9: squalene
  synthase; SanSyn: α-santalene synthase; CYP: cytochrome P450 monooxygenase; CPR2:
  NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase'
