caption: 'Summarized metabolic pathways influenced by the experimental treatments.
  Glycolysis is represented in gray, glycogenolysis in purple, pentose phosphate pathway
  in pink, oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA in green, citrate
  cycle in yellow, cytoplasmic conversion of citrate into α-ketoglutarate in blue,
  glutamine synthesis in orange, and fatty acid degradation in red. Proteins inside
  orange squares were exclusively expressed in MR or were more abundant in MR compared
  to RM. Proteins inside blue squares were exclusively expressed in RM or were more
  abundant in RM compared to MR. α-KGDH: α- ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; ACAT1:
  acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; ACO1: aconitase 1; AGL: glycogen debranching enzyme; DLAT:
  dihydrolipoyl transacetylase; DLD: dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; DLST: dihydrolipoyllysine-residue
  succinyltransferase; ECHS1: enoyl CoA hydratase, short chain 1; ENO2: enolase 2;
  GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLUL: glutamine synthetase; IDH1:
  isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; IDH3A: isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 catalytic subunit
  alpha; OGDH: 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase; PDC: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex;
  PDHA1: pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit alpha 1; PFKM: phosphofructokinase; PGD:
  6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; PKM: pyruvate kinase; TPI1: triosephosphate isomerase.'
