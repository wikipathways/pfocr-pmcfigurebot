caption: Suggested anticancer molecular mechanisms of bromelain. It induces () cytotoxicity
  and reduces () cancer cell proliferation primarily by (I) modulating the expression
  of genes crucial for cell differentiation and proliferation via the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK),
  nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), serine/threonine
  protein kinase (Akt), microtubule-associated protein B-light chain 3 (LC3), and
  p38; (II) inducing cell death by apoptosis/autophagy via Bcl-2-associated X (BAX),
  B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), caspases-3 and -9, reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53,
  LC3, and BECLIN 1; (III) blocking () the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclins B and
  E through the activation of p21; (IV) having an immunomodulatory effect by reducing
  the production of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6 (interleukin), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) by stimulating T helper cells (LyTh), and via the
  proteolytic cleavage of clusters of differentiation 44 (CD44) and CD45RA; and (V)
  reducing inflammation by influencing cycloox-ygenase-2 (COX-2). Created with BioRender.com.
