caption: Annotation and distribution of macrophage subpopulations in PCA, preca-OLK
  and OSCC (A) UMAP plot showing the composition of macrophage colored by cluster.
  (B) Bar plot showing proportion of each macrophage subtype in each tissue. (C) Statistical
  analysis comparing the proportions of IDO1+CD68+cells (IDO1+macrophages) in tissues
  of OLK (n = 25), preca-OLK (n = 15) and OSCC (n = 11). (D) Representative IF staining
  of human tissues (40x). DAPI (blue), IDO1 (red), CD68 (green). Bar, 50 Î¼m. (E) Heatmap
  showing representative GO pathways enrichment of the gene set expressed in macrophage
  subsets predicted by GSVA. (F) Violin plot showing the immunosuppression scoring
  of macrophage subsets. (G) Heatmap showing the expression of immunosuppressive ligand
  and receptor molecules in macrophage subsets in PCA, preca-OLK and OSCC
