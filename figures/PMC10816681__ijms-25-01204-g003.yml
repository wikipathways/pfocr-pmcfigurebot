figure_title: Pseudotime patterns of myogenic cell differentiation.
caption: Pseudotime patterns of myogenic cell differentiation. (A) The pseudotime
  analysis result of satellite cells, myoblasts, myocytes and myotubes with monocle2.
  The 1 and 2 in the circle represent branch point 1 and branch point 2, respectively.
  Black arrows indicated two pseudo-direction of differentiation at branch point 1.
  (B) Distribution of each type of cell across pseudotime trajectory. (C) Scatter
  plot the expression levels of 9 marker genes across pseudotime. The x-axis represents
  pseudotime, the y-axis indicates the normalized gene expression levels, the colors
  refer to the four myogenic cell populations. (D) The differentially expressed genes
  (rows) of myogenic cells were clustered hierarchically into four groups, across
  the two pseudo-direction of differentiation at branch point 1. (E) The representative
  gene functions and pathways of each cluster were shown (Supplementary Table S5)
