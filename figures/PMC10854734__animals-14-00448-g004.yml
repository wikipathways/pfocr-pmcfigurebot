caption: 'Importation and potential transmission routes of SADS-CoV [12,27,33,34,35,36].
  Note: SADS-CoV is currently believed to have evolved from a virus carried by bats.
  It is speculated that SADS-CoV is transmitted from rodents to pigs, causing an epidemic.
  Humans may be potential hosts for this virus. The solid lines in the figure represent
  the currently identified and widely recognized importation or overflow pathways
  of the SADS-CoV virus; the dotted lines and “?” represent potential transmission
  pathways that may exist'
