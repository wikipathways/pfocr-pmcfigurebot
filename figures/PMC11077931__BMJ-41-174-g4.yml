caption: |-
  Activation of the JAK/SYK signaling pathway by TSLP in primary BMDCs in vitro. (a) Representative Western blot images of protein expressions in BMDCs treated with TSLP at various concentrations for TSLPR, phosphorylated JAK1, JAK1, phosphorylated SYK, SYK, phosphorylated NF-κB p65, NF-κB p65, TRAF6, and GAPDH. (b) Quantitative analysis of protein band intensities for TSLPR versus GAPDH, phosphorylated JAK1 versus JAK1, phosphorylated SYK versus SYK, phosphorylated NF-κB p65 versus NF-κB p65, and TRAF6 versus GAPDH.
  JAK, Janus kinase; SYK, spleen tyrosine kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; TSLPR, thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor; TSLP, thymic stromal lymphopoietin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BMDCs, bone marrow dendritic cells; TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated factor 6
