caption: 'SDC2 promotes proliferation and invasiveness of GC cells and its upregulation
  correlates with the activation of AKT pathway. A. Protein levels of SDC2 in five
  lines of GC cells and one line of normal gastric epithelial cells (GES-1) (Western
  blotting). B. Protein levels of SDC2 in three lines of GC cells after stable transfection
  with plasmids that promoted overexpression (OE-SDC2) or knockdown (shRNA) of SDC2
  (Western blotting). C & D. Migration, invasion, and proliferation of three lines
  of GC cells that were transfected with different plasmids (Transwell assay, CCK8
  assay. Scale bar: =100 Âµm). E & F. SDC2-associated signaling pathways in GC based
  on pathways and gene sets (KEGG Enrichment and Hallmark Analysis). G. Protein level
  of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin) and p-AKT, in three lines of GC cells
  that were transfected with different SDC2 plasmids (Western blotting)'
