caption: RNA-seq analysis revealed the MAPK signaling activation involved in the neuron
  damage in HT22. (A) Heat map displaying changes in differentially expressed mRNAs
  in OGD/R-induced HT22 compared with controls. (B) Top 20 enriched KEGG pathway of
  differentially expressed mRNAs. (C) GSEA overview of MAPK signaling in OGD/R-induced
  HT22 compared with controls. (D) Volcano plots of differentially expressed mRNAs
  of MAPK signaling pathway between OGD/R-induced HT22 and relative controls. The
  blue and red points in the plot represents the downregulated and upregulated expressed
  mRNAs with statistical significance, respectively
