caption: KEGG analyses of DEGs for the roots of wheat seedlings treated with 5 mM
  NO3− (CK), 0.1 mM NO3− (LN), and 0.1 mM NO3− + 60 mg/L TIBA (LNT) for 48 h. (A)
  The KEGG enrichment analysis of LN compared with CK. (B) The KEGG enrichment analysis
  of LNT compared with LN. The X-axis in the figure is the GeneRatio; the Y-axis is
  the KEGG pathway. The size of the dots represents the number of genes annotated
  for the KEGG pathway, and the color gradient from red to green represents the significance
  level of the enrichment. The key enriched pathways for DEGs that were involved in
  auxin biosynthesis and transport and nitrogen metabolism were highlighted using
  the red font
