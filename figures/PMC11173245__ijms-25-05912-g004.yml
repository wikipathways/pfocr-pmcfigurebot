figure_title: Expression levels of phytohormone biosynthesis genes and phytohormone
  contents in Syn-treated VR cells.
caption: Expression levels of phytohormone biosynthesis genes and phytohormone contents
  in Syn-treated VR cells. Relative expression level of NECD1 encoding ABA biosynthesis
  rate-limiting enzyme (a) and ABA content 24 h after treatment (b). Relative expression
  levels of ACS3 (c) and ACO2 (d), which encode the rate-limiting enzyme of the ET
  biosynthetic pathway and the enzyme that biosynthesizes ET, respectively. Relative
  expression level of LOX encoding JA biosynthesis rate-limiting enzyme (e) and JA
  content 24 h after treatment (f). VR cells were cultured for 24 h (27 °C, 54.2 μmol
  m−2 s−1/16 h/day) in a medium containing 5 mM Syn. Gene expression levels were estimated
  by real-time RT-PCR. Data are expression levels relative to actin. Phytohormone
  content was determined by ELISA. Data are shown as means ± S.E. of four biological
  replicates (n = 4). * indicates significant differences at p < 0.05 (t-test)
