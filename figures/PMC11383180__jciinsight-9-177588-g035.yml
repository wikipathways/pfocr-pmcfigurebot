figure_title: ADAM17 (p.D647N) variant affects Notch signaling, resulting in hair
  follicle malformation
caption: (A) Effects of ADAM17 mutation on protein levels of key molecules involved
  in Notch signaling observed in the skin biopsy of the patient. (B) Adam17 mutation
  inhibited Notch signaling in the skin tissues of mice. (C) Effects of Adam17 mutation
  on mRNA levels of key molecules involved in Notch signaling observed in the skin
  tissues of mice. (n = 6 biological replicates.) (D) Immunohistochemical staining
  showed that Adam17 mutation led to downregulation of ADAM17 and Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) expression but not full-length Notch1 in Adam17D647N/D647N mice. Scale
  bar, 250 μm. (E) Immunofluorescence showed that Adam17 mutation led to downregulation
  of ADAM17 and NICD expression in hair follicle of Adam17D647N/D647N mice. Scale
  bar, 80 μm. (F) Cellular component separation assay showed that NICD protein level
  was decreased in nucleus of ADAM17-mutant HaCaT cells. Lamin B2 and α-tubulin were
  used as the nuclear (Nue) and cytosolic (Cyto) protein makers, respectively. (G
  and H) Overexpressing NICD significantly rescued the proliferation activity of primary
  fibroblasts derived from Adam17D647N/D647N mice. (n = 3 biological replicates.)
  (I) Schematic diagram of Notch signaling pathway. Following sequentially cleaving
  by ADAM10 and γ-secretase, Notch released its NICD. NICD then translocated to nucleus,
  and, in collaboration with RBPJ and Mastermind, activated the transcription of target
  genes, including members of the Hes and Hey families. All experiments were repeated
  3 times. Results were expressed as mean ± SD; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001;
  1-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test (C); Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests (G)
