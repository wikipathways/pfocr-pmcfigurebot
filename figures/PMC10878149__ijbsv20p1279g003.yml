  ER stress signaling.
caption: CSN5 protects platinum-resistant EOC cells from platinum injury by regulating
  ER stress signaling. Proteomic analysis was applied to identify the O-GlcNAcylated
  proteins in platinum-resistant EOC cells with or without CSN5 knockdown, and functional
  characterization of the identified Oâ€‘GlcNAc proteins was analyzed. (A, B) Significantly
  enriched biochemical and signaling pathways of the identified O-GlcNAcylated proteins
  were revealed by integrated GO and KEGG pathways analysis (p < 0.05). (C, F) qRT-PCR
  analysis of the representative gene expression contained in the ER stress signaling
  pathway in DDP cells with or without CSN5 inhibition. (D, G) IB analysis of the
  representative ER stress signaling protein levels. (E, H) Densitometric analysis
  of protein expression contained in the ER stress signaling pathway. Experiments
  were performed in triplicate
