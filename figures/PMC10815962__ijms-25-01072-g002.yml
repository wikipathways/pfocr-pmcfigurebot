figure_title: Pathogen melanization pathway.
caption: Pathogen melanization pathway. Recognition of pathogen antigens by immune
  cell receptors switches on the melanin synthesis pathway. In this pathway, the activated
  serine proteases convert an inactive phenol oxidase enzyme (prePO) into an active
  phenol oxidase (PO). The PO catalyzes the oxidation of phenols to quinones, which
  polymerize into melanin that is deposited on the pathogenâ€™s surface. Eventually,
  a pathogen is encapsulated by the layer of melanin and killed by quinones, and reactive
  oxygen species are produced during the melanization process
