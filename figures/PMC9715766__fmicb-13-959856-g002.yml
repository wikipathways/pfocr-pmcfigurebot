caption: Pathogenic proteins activate signal transduction pathways in microglia leading
  to NDs. In AD, Aβ can bind to TLR4/6 on microglia and induce the release of inflammatory
  factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) through the downstream MyD88/NLRP3 and NF-κB signaling
  pathways. It also activates TREM2 on microglia, causing DAP12 to enhance Syk and
  induce a cascade of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which leads to apoptosis and
  myelin damage through immune pathways. For Tau protein, it can activate microglia
  through PQBP1/CGAS/STING pathway, and 40% NF-κB can amplify inflammatory response
  in this process, leading to a series of nerve damage. The rest is supplemented by
  TREM2/ERK/PIK3. In PD, α-syn can stimulate microglia to secrete proinflammatory
  cytokines, such as ROS, TNF-α, IL-1β, COX2, and iNOS through TLR/MyD88/NLRP3 pathway.
  It also binds to TLR2 to induce nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which triggers the
  production of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, and ultimately IL-1β secretion. TLR,
