figure_title: Metabolic pathways of Caco-2 and Hep-G2 cells positively affected by
  the presence of Aramé extract.
caption: Metabolic pathways of Caco-2 and Hep-G2 cells positively affected by the
  presence of Aramé extract. Obtained using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 pathway enrichment analysis
  of significantly different metabolites between groups (p < 0.05). The enrichment
  rate is calculated as the number of hits between a particular metabolic pathway
  divided by the expected number of hits
