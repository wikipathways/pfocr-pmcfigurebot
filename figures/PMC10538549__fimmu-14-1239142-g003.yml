caption: Role of cGAS-STING signaling activation in health and intestinal diseases.
  In the context of health (A), the intricate symbiotic interplay between the intestinal
  microbiota and the colonic mucosa relies on the intrinsic STING pathway present
  in both epithelial and immune cells. This dynamic interaction facilitates the defense
  against pathogenic infections by stimulating the secretion of type I interferons
  (IFN-I) and Interferon-stimulated gene (ISGs), reinforcing the integrity and regeneration
  of the epithelial barrier, promoting the production of antimicrobial peptides by
  Paneth cells, mucus synthesis by goblet cells, secretory IgA (SIgA) expression by
  plasma cells. This mutually beneficial relationship is crucial for maintaining immune
  cell homeostasis and establishing a harmonious and balanced gut environment. Colorectal
  cancer (B) is marked by an imbalanced state of the microbiota. Within this context,
  the release of DNA from dead tumor cells triggers the activation of the STING pathway
  in tumor cells and immune cells. This dual activation cascade promotes a pro-inflammatory
  immune response within the tumor microenvironment, effectively impeding tumorigenesis.
  Notably, STING activation facilitates the infiltration, activation, proliferation,
  and cross-priming of dendritic cells, macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells. Inflammatory
  bowel disease (IBD) (C) also manifests dysbiosis and the translocation of pathogenic
  microorganisms into the lamina propria (LP) due to a compromised epithelial barrier.
  Bacterial DNA or cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and self-DNA derived from damaged cells,
  including double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), induce the
  activation of STING in both epithelial and immune cells, thereby exacerbating intestinal
  mucosal inflammation. Furthermore, STING activation and its downstream effectors
  elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis, contributing to epithelial
  barrier damage. Consequently, macrophage infiltration and activation, along with
  T cell accumulation in the LP, are promoted by STING activation, perpetuating the
  imbalance of pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines in IBD. Similar to IBD, intestinal
  injury (D) is characterized by dysbiosis, epithelial damage, and the translocation
  of bacteria. Bacterial DNA or CDNs and self-DNA from damaged or dead cells play
  a significant role in activating the STING pathway, leading to cellular death, inflammation,
  and intestinal barrier disruption. Furthermore, activation of the STING pathway
  in immune cells elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, subsequently causing
  lipid peroxidation and triggering the production of IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  This collective response perpetuates a state of sustained inflammation within the
  intestinal environment. The solid line represents effects, the dotted line represents
  translocation. Created with BioRender.com.
