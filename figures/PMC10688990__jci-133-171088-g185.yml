figure_title: Metabolically active TREM2 macrophages express genes in association
  with giant cells
caption: '(A) UMAP plots for all skin scRNA-Seq data (5 healthy subjects and 3 patients)
  showing macrophage subsets. (B) An abundance of each macrophage subset in all skin
  scRNA-Seq data (5 healthy subjects and 3 patients). Šídák’s multiple-comparisons
  test was conducted between the healthy and sarcoidosis samples for each subset.
  *P < 0.05. (C) Dot plot of genes upregulated in M1and M2 macrophages in macrophage
  fractions of scRNA-Seq data (5 healthy subjects and 3 patients). (D) Heatmap showing
  marker genes for each subset in all skin scRNA-Seq data (5 healthy subjects and
  3 patients). Representative genes are labeled. (E) Heatmap showing metabolic pathway
  expression for each cell subset in all skin scRNA-Seq data (5 healthy subjects and
  3 patients) via Reactome pathway database. (F and G) Representative H&E and immunofluorescence
  (F) staining and bar graph (G) in sarcoidosis skin samples (n = 3) for expression
  of CD68 (gray), FBP1 (red), CHI3L1 (green), and DAPI (blue). Dotted lines indicate
  giant cells, and arrowheads point to FBP1+CHI3L1+ cells. Scale bars: 50 μm. Mann-Whitney
  U tests were conducted between nongiant and giant cells. *P < 0.05'
