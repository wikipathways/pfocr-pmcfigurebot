caption: CD47 related signaling pathway analysis in grade III meningioma. (A-C) Representative
  images of immumohistochemical staining of p-ERK (A), Î²-catenin (B) and EGFR (C)
  in CD47-high and CD47-low meningioma of grade III. (D-E) Western blot analysis showed
  that the expression of CD47 in IOMM-Lee cells transfected with si-CD47 was significantly
  reduced, also along with a significant decrease in p-ERK and EGFR expression compared
  with si-NC and control group. ***p < 0.001
