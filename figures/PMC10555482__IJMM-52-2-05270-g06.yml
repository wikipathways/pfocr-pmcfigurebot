  proteins increased in the NR8383 cells with exposed to hypoxia.
caption: The expression of F2/Rho, HMGB1/RAGE/p38MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway-related
  proteins increased in the NR8383 cells with exposed to hypoxia. (A) Western blot
  analysis was performed to examine the protein expression levels of F2, ROCK1, RhoA,
  HMGB1, RAGE, p38MAPK and (NF-κB) p65. (B-H) Relative protein expression was normalized
  to that of the respective control, β-actin. Protein expression exhibited variable
  changes; *P<0.05, vs. the control group. C, control; H, hypoxia; RAGE, receptor
  for advanced glycation end products; HMGB1, high mobility group protein-1
