figure_title: NPM1 silencing suppresses malignant characteristics by inhibiting the
  EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway.
caption: 'NPM1 silencing suppresses malignant characteristics by inhibiting the EGFR/MAPK
  signaling pathway. (A) The expression of p-EGFR/EGFR, p-MEK/MEK and p-ERK/ERK was
  detected using western blotting. (B) Cell viability was evaluated by Cell Counting
  Kit-8 assay. (C) Cell migration at 0 and 24 h was determined using wound healing
  assay. Scale bar, 50 µm. (D) Cell invasion was detected by Transwell assay. Scale
  bar, 50 µm. (E) The expression of p-EGFR/EGFR, p-MEK/MEK and p-ERK/ERK was evaluated
  using western blotting. sh-NPM1 transfected A549 cells were treated with EGF. #P<0.05
  and ##P<0.01 vs. sh-NC, &&P<0.01 vs. sh-NC + EGF, ^P<0.05 and ^^P<0.01 vs. sh-NPM1.
  NPM1, nucleophosmin; p-, phosphorylated; sh-, short hairpin; NC, negative control'
