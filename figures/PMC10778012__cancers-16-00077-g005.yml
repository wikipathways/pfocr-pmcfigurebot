caption: 'tRF-mediated translational regulation. (A) Global inhibition: Angiogenin
  induces the formation of a 5′ tRNA half with a terminal oligoguanine (TOG) motif.
  This molecule inhibits translation in a manner that is independent of phospho-eIF2α.
  The 5′-TOG motif folds into a tetramolecular RNA G-quadruplex (RG4) structure, which
  induces the assembly of stress granules (SG). This assembly ultimately leads to
  the inhibition of translation initiation. The involvement of Y-box binding protein
  1 (YB-1 or YBX1) is necessary for the assembly of stress granules. (B) Translational
  activation: The LeuCAG 3′ tsRNA binds to RPS28 mRNA, causing a change in its secondary
  structure. This alteration ultimately leads to the activation of translation. (C)
  Regulate protein translation by affecting mRNA stability: The tRF/miR-1280 molecule
  effectively inhibited colorectal cancer (CRC) cell growth and metastasis. This inhibition
  was achieved through direct interaction with the 3′ UTR region of its target gene,
  JAG2, and subsequent inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway'
