figure_title: Number distribution and pathway analysis of differentially expressed
  genes.
caption: 'Number distribution and pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes.
  (a) Number distribution of unigenes assigned to the COG database. X-axis: COG functional
  classification. Y-axis: numbers of unigenes assigned to different COG functional
  classifications. (b) DEGs KEGG taxonomy. DEGs related to photosynthesis pathway,
  plant auxin, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. (c) Percent and number distributions
  of unigenes assigned to the GO database in the UV-B-treated leaves. X-axis: GO categories.
  Y-axis: number of unigenes assigned to different GO categories'
