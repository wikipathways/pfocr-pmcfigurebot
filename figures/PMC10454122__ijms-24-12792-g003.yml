caption: 'Clinical outcome score (COS) at five-year follow-up for sarcoidosis patients
  stained for three inflammatory signaling pathways: (a) NLRP3, (b) mTORC1, and (c)
  JAK/STAT. In the group stained for the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, significantly
  more patients with IHC â‰¥ 5 were shown to have a high COS (p = 0.021). * p-value
  < 0.05'
