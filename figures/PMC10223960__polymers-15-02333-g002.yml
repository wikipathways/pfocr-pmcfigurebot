caption: The patterns of PHA production in vivo and in vitro. (a) Traditional in vivo
  PHA production involves strain construction, metabolic pathways engineering, fermentation
  optimization, and process scaling up. (b) PHA synthesis using a transcriptionâ€“translation
  system. In this system, the cell crude extract contains plasmid DNA and the enzymes
  required for PHA synthesis are first transcribed and translated in the cell crude
  extract to form the PHA synthesis pathway, which can synthesize PHA when the substrate
  is available. (c) Traditional cell-free PHA synthesis. The cell crude extracts were
  directly used as the reaction system (left), or mixing purified enzymes to form
  a cell-free system for PHA synthesis (right). In the figure, the blue circle indicates
  PhaA, the green star indicates PhaB, and the pink hexagon indicates PhaC
