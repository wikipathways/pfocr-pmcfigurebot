figure_title: Malat1 binds to β-catenin to positively regulate canonical Wnt/ β-catenin
  signaling pathway
caption: (a) ChIRP analysis of the specificity and efficiency of the Malat1 probe.
  Mouse Malat1 or the control GFP probes were used to pull down endogenous Malat1
  from MC3T3-E1 cells, followed by qPCR quantification of Malat1. (b) ChIRP analysis
  of the Malat1 binding to β-catenin. Mouse Malat1-specific probes were used to pull
  down the endogenous Malat1 in the MC3T3-E1 cells, followed by immunoblotting with
  anti-β-catenin antibody. (c) RIP assay of β-catenin binding to Malat1. Endogenous
  β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from MC3T3-E1 cells, and the β-catenin-bound Malat1
  was quantitated by qPCR. Rabbit IgG was used as a negative control IP antibody.
  (d) Immunoblot analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of β-catenin
  in calvarial osteoblasts that were serum starved for 16h, followed by treatment
  with 50% Wnt3a- or the control L- conditional medium for 1h. TBP1 and GAPDH were
  measured as loading controls for nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively.
  (e) Luciferase reporter assay of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity measured from
  the indicated calvarial osteoblasts transfected with the M50 Super 8x TOPFlash reporter
  plasmid and pRL-Tk control plasmid for 48 h, followed by treatment with or without
  20% Wnt3a conditional medium for 16h (n = 5). (f) qPCR analysis of mRNA expression
  of β-catenin target genes in calvarial osteoblasts in the osteogenic medium (α-MEM
  with 10% FBS supplemented with 10mM β-glycerophosphate and 100 ug/ml ascorbic acid)
  for seven days. Data are mean ± SD. c,e ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001 by two-way
  ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. f, **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 by
  Student’s t test
