caption: Molecular mechanisms of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis.
  (A) B cell activation during acute and chronic HCV infection, which then leads to
  polyclonal activation and expansion of B cells producing monoclonal IgM rheumatoid
  factor (RF). Monoclonal IgMs that are known to display RF activity, favoring the
  formation of cold-precipitable immune complexes formed by the monoclonal IgM itself,
  HCV, and anti-HCV polyclonal IgG antibodies, which are responsible for glomerulonephritis.
  (B) The classical complement pathway is activated when the cold-precipitable immune
  complexes are deposited in the mesangial and subendothelial space in the kidney.
  When complement component C4 is cleaved by cold-precipitable immune complexes, it
  forms two fragments, C4a and C4b. This then results in the downstream formation
  of C3 and C5 convertases. C3a and C5a activate the complement cascade via C3aR and
  C5aR, which amplifies the inflammatory response by activating neutrophils. The interaction
  of the membrane attack complex (MAC) with C3b and C5b enhances tissue factor (TF)
  expression in endothelial cells (ECs) of the kidney and can further promote proinflammatory
  EC activation.
