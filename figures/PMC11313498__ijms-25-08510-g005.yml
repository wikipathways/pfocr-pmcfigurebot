caption: A dual immunofluorescence assay on free-floating spinal cord sections confirmed
  that spinal Pdyn neurons contribute to burn injury-induced epigenetic reprogramming,
  particularly via the p-S10H3 pathway. (a–f) Representative images display immunostaining
  with antibodies against EGRP and histone H3 PTMs or total histone H3 in transverse
  spinal cord sections from Pdyn::EGFP mice, where all Pdyn neurons express EGFP.
  Individual channels are presented in greyscale, and pseudocolor is used in the composite
  images. Note that in this set of experiments, only the left hind paw (ipsilateral)
  was exposed to burn injury. Scale bars, 50 μm
