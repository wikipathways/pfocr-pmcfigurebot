figure_title: Genes network interaction construction.
caption: Genes network interaction construction. (A) Network interaction of hub genes
  in four modules (blue, brown, salmon, and red). (B) Network interaction of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) for peroxisome, catalase, plant hormone signal transduction,
  and MAPK cascade pathways. Nodes are the common DEGs involved in plant hormone signal
  transduction and MAPK cascade pathways
