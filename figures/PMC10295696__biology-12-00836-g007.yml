figure_title: Proposed pathways of the shell calcification and biomineralisation in
  Achatina fulica.
caption: Proposed pathways of the shell calcification and biomineralisation in Achatina
  fulica. The primary source was the release of CO2 from the carbohydrate metabolism
  (green arrow) and transport to the extrapallial fluid space (EFS) (grey dashed arrow).
  The CO2 was converted to HCO3− by several intracellular carbonic anhydrases (red
  arrow), and the bicarbonate ions were actively transported to the EFS through SLC26A
  transporters or HCO3−/Cl− exchangers (dark blue oval and dark brown arrows) and
  SLC4A transporters or HCO3−/Na+ exchangers (orange oval and dark brown arrow). Excess
  hydrogen ions produced by the formation of calcium carbonate and from carbonic anhydrase
  were eliminated through the Na+/H+ exchanger (dark red oval and dark red arrow)
  out of the EFS. Calcium intake from food could reach the extrapallial fluid space
  passively by diffusion through Ca2+ channels (purple oval and dark green arrow)
  and gap junctions (green dash arrow) or actively by the Ca2+-pumping ATPase (pink
  oval and dark green arrow). The CaCO3 then formed the structure of prismatic and
  nacreous layers making up the A. fulica shell with the assistance of a collagen
  protein network as the scaffold (red line)
