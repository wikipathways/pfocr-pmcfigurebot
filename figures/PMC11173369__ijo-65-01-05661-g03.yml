caption: Microbial metabolites promote the transformation of the TME from a 'cold'
  environment to a 'hot' environment, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. When
  used alone, UroA can reduce the number of M2 macrophages in the TME, increase the
  infiltration of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, and downregulate the expression of
  PD-1 on CD8+ T cells. SCFAs can directly reduce the accumulation of tumor-specific
  and memory T cells, increase the proportion of Tregs and inhibit the efficacy of
  immunotherapy. LPS promotes the secretion of IL-6 by tumor cells, activates the
  JAK/STAT signaling pathway and reduces efficacy of immunotherapy. LPS and butyric
  acid respectively promote and inhibit the secretion of IL-12 by M1 macrophages,
  affecting the differentiation of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells, and regulating the
  infiltration of Tregs. Adenosine, in the presence of exogenous IFN-Î³, binds to A2AR
  on CD4+ T cells, promoting the accumulation of memory T cells. The figure was created
  using BioRender.com. TME, tumor microenvironment; UroA, urolithin A; PD-1, programmed
  cell death protein 1; SCFAs, short-chain fatty acids; Treg, regulatory T cell; LPS,
