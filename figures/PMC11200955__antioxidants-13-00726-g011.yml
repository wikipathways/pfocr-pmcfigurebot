caption: Halodule uninervis ethanolic extract inhibits the STAT3 signaling pathway.
  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 24 h either with vehicle-containing control or
  HUE (100 or 200 μg/mL). The protein levels of the phosphorylated STAT3 were assessed
  via Western blotting, using β-actin as a loading control. Data represent the mean
  ± SEM of three independent experiments (n = 3). (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.005)
