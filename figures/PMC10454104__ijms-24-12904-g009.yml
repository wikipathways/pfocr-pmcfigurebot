caption: 'OLR1 acts as a repressor of cuproptosis in HNSCC cells: (A) Correlations
  of OLR1 and cuproptosis-related genes in the TCGA-HNSCC dataset; (B) cell viability
  of Cal27 and SCC4 cells following treatment with the indicated concentrations of
  elesclomol (* p < 0.05); (C) cuproptosis cells were stained with Annexin V and PI
  for flow cytometry in Cal27 treated with elesclomol (40 nM) and TTM (20 nM); (D)
  quantitative statistical analysis shows different percentages of cell death in siOLR1
  and the control group (*** p < 0.001, ns, no significant difference); (E) DLAT oligomerization
  was analyzed by Western blot in Cal27 cells that were treated with elesclomol (40
  nM); (F) schematic illustration of the role of OLR1 in HNSCC. In brief, the elevated
  expression of OLR1 activates the STAT3 signaling pathway to regulate metastasis,
  the EMT process, and stemness characteristics in HNSCC. In addition, OLR1 negatively
  modulates cuproptosis by inhibiting DLAT oligomerization. In summary, OLR1 is associated
  with poor prognosis and may serve as an emerging target for cancer therapy'
