figure_title: Relative mRNA expression levels in cells of BALF of (a) NLRP3 inflammasome,
  (b) JAK/STAT, and (c) mTORC1 signaling pathways.
caption: 'Relative mRNA expression levels in cells of BALF of (a) NLRP3 inflammasome,
  (b) JAK/STAT, and (c) mTORC1 signaling pathways. For every protein, the RNA expression
  levels were divided into 3 groups based on the IHC score. Abbreviations: NLRP3,
  NLR family pyrin domain-containing-3; JAK1, Janus kinase-1; JAK2, Janus kinase-2;
  STAT1, signal transducers and activators of transcription-1; STAT3, signal transducers
  and activators of transcription-3; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
  1; S6K1, target protein S6 kinase-1'
