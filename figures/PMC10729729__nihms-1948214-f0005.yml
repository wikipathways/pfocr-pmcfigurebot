figure_title: Human psoriasis is associated with NFκB-mediated chemokine signaling
caption: (A) The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection showed two different
  clusters, which are healthy samples (green, n = 21) and psoriasis samples (blue,
  n = 33).(B) The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from volcano plot with an
  adjusted p value cutoff of 0.05 (red dots are upregulated genes, blue dots are downregulated
  genes, gray dots are genes with no significance).(C–E) Relative expression of CXCL1
  (C), CXCL8 (D), and IL-36 γ (E) in skin samples from healthy individuals and lesional
  skin samples from patients with psoriasis. Data were analyzed by publicly accessing
  the GSE14905 database. This database contains 21 healthy individuals and 33 psoriasis
  patients.(F) The analysis of gene ontology biological process (version 2021) from
  top hits cytokines indicated the most important signaling pathways.(G) The most
  relevant transcription factors were predicted by the analysis of transcriptional
  regulatory relationships unraveled by sentence-based text mining (TRRUST).(H) Real-time
  PCR for cytokine expression in skin tissue on both IMQ-treated mice and control
  mice. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison
  test (n = 3/group). Data are shown as mean ± SD in (C–E and H) (****p < 0.0001 compared
  with control groups, unpaired Student’s t test). See also Figure S5
