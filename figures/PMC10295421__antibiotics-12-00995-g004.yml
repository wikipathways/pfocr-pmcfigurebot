caption: Statistical evaluation of the effects of single and combination groups on
  mTOR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in tumor tissues obtained from xenograft mice. Micrographs
  were taken using a light microscope at 40× magnification. All micrographs were analyzed
  with Image-J 2x.Ink software by scanning four nonoverlapping fields in each tissue
  and expressing the positive areas as a percentage of the total area. The percentage
  of cells expressing p-AKT, p-PI3K, and p-mTOR in each tissue was calculated with
  the Image-J software program. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 4). *, ** and
  *** indicate statistical differences of p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively,
  compared to control group cells
