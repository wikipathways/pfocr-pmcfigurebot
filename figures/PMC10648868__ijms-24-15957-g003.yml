  pathway.
caption: DnaJ-induced IL−1β expression is under the control of CD91/CD40 signaling
  pathway. Cells were transfected with either 10 or 20 nM of either CD91 siRNA or
  CD40 siRNA. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the transfected cells were treated
  with 1 μg/mL of DnaJ for 4 h (A–D) or for the indicated time (G). The effect of
  siRNA was verified by qPCR analysis (E,F). After treatment, the increase in mRNA
  levels was quantified by qPCR analysis, and the levels of protein were measured
  by either ELISA or immunoblot analysis. Data in (A–F) are expressed as means ± SD
  (n = 3). Data in (G) are representative of three separate experiments. **, p < 0.01;
  ***, p < 0.001 vs. DnaJ treatment alone (A–D) or no transfection (E–F)
