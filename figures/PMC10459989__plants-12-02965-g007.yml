caption: Expression profiling of differentially expressed major transcription factor
  families among the four groups (CKAC, AC, CKMT, MT) in leaves at 22 h (AC) and 24
  h (MT) post-inoculation with B. cinerea. (a) AUX/IAA transcription factors regulating
  auxin signaling pathways; (b) NACs; (c) WRKYs; (d) MYBs. Expression values of each
  gene are the log2-transformed expression values. Colors represent the expression
  levels
