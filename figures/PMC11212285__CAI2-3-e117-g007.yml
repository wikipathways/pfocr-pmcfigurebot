caption: Schematic diagram of mitogen‐activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) role in tumor
  angiogenesis and progression of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (a) MAPK4 facilitates
  tumor angiogenesis and progression in NSCLC by promoting the growth of endothelial
  cell (CD34+ EC), which is related to altered transduction of Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway. (b) Targeted intervention the expression of MAPK4 in CD34+ ECs can repress
  tumor angiogenesis and progression of NSCLC. ERK1/2, extracellular regulated protein
  kinases 1/2; MEK, mitogen‐activated extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; Raf,
  rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma.
