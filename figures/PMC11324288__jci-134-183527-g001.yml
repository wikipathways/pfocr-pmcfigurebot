figure_title: SLC44A2 mediates the VSMC phenotypic switch in aortic aneurysm
caption: (A) The switch from a contractile to a synthetic state is crucial for the
  development and progression of aortic aneurysm. SLC44A2 functions as a scaffolding
  protein that regulates the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway by forming a complex with
  NRP1 and ITGB3. This complex facilitates the release of activated TGF-β from latent
  TGF-β (latency-associated peptide [LAP]), which then binds to TGF-β receptors (TGFBRs)
  on the cell membrane, initiating the downstream phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. p-SMAD2/3
  then translocates into the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of contractile
  markers ACTA2 and TAGLN, or synthetic markers KLF4 and OPN, associated with the
  VSMC phenotypic switch. SLC44A2 deficiency induced by siSLC44A2 disrupts the association
  between NRP1 and ITGB3, reduces the levels of TGF-β and p-SMAD2, and promotes the
  expression of synthetic VSMC markers KLF4 and OPN, while suppressing contractile
  VSMC markers ACTA2 and TAGLN, further contributing to the pathogenesis of aortic
  aneurysm. (B) RUNX1 acts as a key regulator of SLC44A2 by binding to the SLC44A2
  promoter region and transcriptionally activating SLC44A2 gene expression. Lenalidomide
  (LEN), an activator of RUNX1, enhances SLC44A2 expression, boosting the SLC44A2/NRP1/ITGB3/TGF-β/SMAD
  signaling pathway. This promotes the expression of VSMC contractile markers ACTA2
  and TAGLN, and represses synthetic VSMC markers KLF4 and OPN, inhibiting the phenotypic
  switching of VSMCs from a contractile to a synthetic state, ultimately suppressing
  the development of aortic aneurysm
