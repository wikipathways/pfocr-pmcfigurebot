figure_title: PAI-1 alters TME and regulates tumor cell migration and invasion.
caption: PAI-1 alters TME and regulates tumor cell migration and invasion. PAI-1 modulates
  pericellular proteolysis by titrating the activity of uPA-dependent plasmin generation
  and subsequent upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to extensive
  ECM remodeling. In parallel, the binding of pericellular PAI-1 directly to the endocytic
  receptor, LRP1, results in activation of the Jak/Stat1 signaling pathway and de
  novo synthesis of PAI-1. Consequentially, this elevated stromal PAI-1 increasingly
  binds to tertiary cell surface uPA/uPAR/integrin complexes, leading to inactivation
  of those integrins and their detachment from the ECM, resulting in local cell detachment.
  Upon recruitment of LRP1, endocytic clearance of these inactive complexes leads
  to lysosomal degradation of the uPA/PAI-1, subcellular redistribution and recycling
  of the receptors to the leading edge of the tumor cells, promoting locally reattachment
  (integrins), transient pericellular proteolysis (uPAR) and further cycles of PAI-1-driven
  receptor internalization and recycling (LRP) in support of increased cell motility
  and invasion. PLG = plasminogen; MMP = matrix metalloproteinase. (Created with BioRender.com)
