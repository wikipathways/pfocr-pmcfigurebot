figure_title: zcrb1 is essential for Wnt signaling and development in zebrafisha.
caption: zcrb1 is essential for Wnt signaling and development in zebrafisha. Alignment
  of ZCRB1 amino acid sequence in human and zebrafish, respectively. Shaded regions
  represent exact homology.b. Phenotype analysis of CRISPR/Cas12a mediated editing
  of zcrb1 in zebrafish embryos. Schematic is representative of zcrb1 locus and location
  of CRISPR/Cas12a editing.c. Stacked barplot representing the percentage of phenotypes
  show in Cas12a and zcrb1 crispant embryos, WT embryos injected with ZCRB1 mRNA,
  and zcrb1 crispant embryos injected with ZCRB1 mRNA.d. Volcano plot representative
  of DE genes identified by RNA-seq between zcrb1 crispant embryonic cells and WT.
  The red and blue dots denote significantly upregulated and downregulated genes,
  respectively, while the grey dots denote genes with no measure significant change.
  The horizontal dashed lines represent the cut off for significant fold change (≥
  absolute log2 fold change of .58), while the horizontal line signifies the FDR significance
  cut-off (≤ 0.05).e. Barplot representative of the top FDR significant enriched biological
  processes (BP) identified in crispant zcrb1 embryonic cells vs WT. The length of
  bars is proportional to the FDR (adjusted p value) and the shading dictates the
  degree of linear fold change shown by the color bar. The iameter of the red dots
  on the end of the bars represents the number of genes present in each identified
  enriched pathway.f. Barplot representative of top DE Wnt signaling pathway genes
  (FDR ≤ 0.05 and absolute linear fold change ≥ 1.5) as identified by RNA-seq analysis.
  Red and blue bars, upregulated and downregulated linear foldchanges, respectively.
  The color intensity denotes the degree of expression change. The FDR values for
  each expression level are displayed next to their respective bars
