figure_title: Adapted anoikis resistant cancer cells evade killing by cytotoxic T
  cells
caption: '(A) Normalized Enrichment score (NES) for Hallmark inflammatory response
  pathway plotted against Hallmark apoptosis in OV90 cells derived from P0 (parental),
  P1, P3, P4, P6, and P7 (after 1 to 7 cycles of suspension culture for 24 hours respectively)
  n=3 replicates. (B) Semi qRT-PCR analysis of HLA-A, B, and C mRNA expression in
  indicated anoikis sensitive (P0, P1: after one round of 24 hr suspension stress)
  and isogenic anoikis resistant (P6, P7) OV90 cells. n=2-3 replicates. Data are mean
  ± SEM. ns p > 0.05 ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
  multiple comparison. (C) Representative western blot for TAP1 (lower) and MHC-I
  (upper) in indicated AnS and AnR derivative cells. Quantitation of TAP1 and MHC-I
  normalized to β-actin shown below. (n= 2). (D) Schematic of immune mediated tumor
  killing assay. CD8+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs and activated for 48 hours
  then co cultured with either OV90 or CAOV3 cells in the attached condition. (ii)
  Percent cell viability of indicated OV90 and CAOV3 cells measured by trypan blue
  staining after incubation with activated CD8+ T cells (24 and 48 hours for OV90
  and 24 hours for CAOV3). n=3, Data are mean ± SEM. ns p > 0.05, * p < 0.05, ** p
  < 0.01, *** p < 0.001. Two-way ANOVA for OV90 and One-way ANOVA for CAOV3 followed
  by Tukey’s multiple comparison. (iii, iv, v) Representative widefield immunofluorescence
  images of Cleaved Caspase 3 (red) and DAPI (blue) (left), and quantitation of percent
  apoptosis (right) from indicated OV90 and CAOV3 cells co-cultured with activated
  CD8+ T cells (48 hours for OV90 and 12 hours for CAOV3 cells). Data are mean ± SEM.
  ns p > 0.05, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p <0.0001, One-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison. Scale bar: 50 μm. (n= 3 biological trials,
  each trial includes quantitation of a minimum of four 60X fields)'
