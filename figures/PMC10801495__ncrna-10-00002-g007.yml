caption: RNA-seq enrichment analysis and ELISAs show impact of miR-4646-5p on cholesterol
  biosynthesis as well as cytokine signaling and secretion. Gene set enrichment analysis
  of RNA-seq data from miR-4646-5p mimic-transfected SUM159 showed enrichment of (A)
  upregulated genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (normalized enrichment
  score = 1.52; p = 0.0299) and (B) downregulated genes in the interleukin-10 signaling
  pathway (normalized enrichment score = −2.02; p < 0.001). (C) PANTHER overrepresentation
  test of genes downregulated by miR-4646-5p. Depicted are all gene ontology (GO)
  molecular functions with significant (false discovery rate p-value < 0.05, Fisher’s
  Exact test) overrepresentations of downregulated genes and the number of downregulated
  genes in each GO group. Expression of (D) granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
  (G-CSF) and (E) interleukin-6 (IL-6) after miR-4646-5p mimic transfection of SUM159
  and MDA-MB-231 cells, as measured by RT-qPCR (n = 3; mean ± SD; * p ≤ 0.05, ** p
  ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001; n.d. = not detected). (F) G-CSF and (G) IL-6 ELISAs of the
  supernatant of miR-4646-5p mimic- or control-transfected SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells
  (n = 4; mean ± SD; * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001; n.d. = not detected)
