caption: 'Neuronal pathways involved in thermosensation in different species. In humans
  (A) and rodents (B), temperature information from the skin is sensed by primary
  somatosensory neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia.
  Subsequently, these neurons relay this information to the DH of the spinal cord
  (red lines). The DH contains neurons projecting to the LPB in the brainstem (blue
  lines). Finally, third-order neurons located within the LPB project to the POA of
  the hypothalamus (green line). Both warm- and cold-activated LPB neurons send projections
  to the POA of the hypothalamus. (C) In flies, the external sensors, called hot or
  cool cells, are located at the base of the aristae and in the sacculus region of
  the third antennal segment. All cool and hot cells project to a central region called
  the PAP to form synapses and connect with downstream PNs to convey temperature information
  (red line). The thermal PNs (green line) further transfer the received information
  to higher brain centers, including the MB and PLP. DH: dorsal horn. LPB: lateral
  parabrachial nucleus. POA: preoptic area. TRPP: transient receptor potential polycystin.
  PAP: proximal antennal protocerebrum. MB: mushroom body. PLP: posterior lateral
  protocerebrum. PNs: projection neurons'
