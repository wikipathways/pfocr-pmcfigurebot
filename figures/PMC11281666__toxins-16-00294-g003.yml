caption: (A) Results of mRNA sequencing of L-02 cells; (B) plot of principal component
  analysis of sequencing results; (C) comparative volcano plot of differentially expressed
  genes by exposure group in L-02 cells (Each dot in the figure represents a gene.
  Blue dots indicate significantly downregulated genes, red dots indicate significantly
  upregulated genes, and grey dots indicate genes with no significant difference);
  (D) regulation of significantly differentially expressed genes in each group; and
  (E) Venn diagram of differential genes in various lipid metabolism-related pathways
