figure_title: Cancer cells evade cellular stress-induced cell death through activation
  of metabolic alteration and damage response pathway. Cancer cells manage to respond
  to and adapt to cellular stress by activating specific cellular pathways related
  to metabolic alterations and damage response. These pathways include DNA damage
  response, energy response, and oxidative stress response. Cancer cells adapt and
  survive stress-induced cell death by altering their metabolism in response to cellular
  stress that triggers regulated cell death. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial
  for developing effective strategies to target cancer cells and improve treatment
  outcomes
