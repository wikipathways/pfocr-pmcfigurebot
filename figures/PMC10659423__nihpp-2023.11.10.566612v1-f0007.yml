figure_title: Tick EVs impact keratinocyte proliferation
caption: (A) Ingenuity pathway analysis derived from siV33 compared to the bite of
  scV33 ticks on FVB-Jax or FVB-Tac mice. Canonical pathways predicted to be inhibited
  (blue, negative z-score) or activated (orange, positive z-score) based on differential
  expression profile. The solid line indicates the p-value significance threshold
  of 0.05 (−log=1.3). (B) The signaling cascade of EIF2 (highlighted in yellow, A),
  yielding (→) or inhibitory (┤) arrows. Orange indicates activation whereas blue
  shows inhibition according to the IPA prediction. Gene expression based on the scRNAseq
  experiment is indicated in red (increased) or green (decreased). Gray – no expression
  or prediction. (C) ScV33 (circle) or siV33 (square) injected I. scapularis nymphs
  were fed on FVB-Jax (white) or FVB-Tac (gray) mice for 3 days. Biopsies were taken
  from the skin at the bite site and assessed for EpCAM+ Ki67+ keratinocytes by flow
  cytometry. (D-I) ScV33 or siV33 ticks fed on C57BL/6 mice for 3 days. Biopsies were
  taken from the skin at the bite site and processed for flow cytometry analysis.
  (D) PI3K p85+, and (E) phospho-PI3K p85/p55+. (F) ELISA analysis of KGF normalized
  to total protein per 5 mm skin punch biopsy. (G) EpCAM+ Ki67+ keratinocytes assessed
  by flow cytometry. Graph displays proliferation changes within the scV33 or siV33
  treatments compared to the naïve skin. Data are presented as a mean with standard
  deviation. Statistical significance shown as *p<0.05, ns = not significant. (C-G)
  Significance was measured by One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. (H-I)
  Flow cytometry histogram plots of EpCAM+ Ki67+ keratinocytes. (H) scV33 or (I) siV33
  treatments displayed according to the number of ticks bitten per biopsy. X-axis
  shows fluorescence intensity, and the Y-axis indicates the count of events in the
  fluorescence channel
