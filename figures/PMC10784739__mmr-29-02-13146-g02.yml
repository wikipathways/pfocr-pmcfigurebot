figure_title: TIFA activates the NF-κB pathway and promotes the expression of inflammasomes.
caption: TIFA activates the NF-κB pathway and promotes the expression of inflammasomes.
  (A) The expression of NF-κB p65 in cytoplasm and in nucleus was examined by western
  blotting. (B) The location of NF-κB p65 was detected by immunofluorescence. Scale
  bar, 50 µm. (C) The protein expression of NLRP3 and ASC was examined by western
  blotting. Data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation, **P<0.01. TIFA,
  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-interacting protein with forkhead-associated
  domain; NLRP3, Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3; ASC,
  apoptosis-associated speck-like protein; NG, normal glucose; HG, high glucose; LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide from Porphvromonas ginaivalis; sh, short hairpin
