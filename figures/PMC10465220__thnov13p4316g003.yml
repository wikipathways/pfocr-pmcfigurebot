figure_title: CD45+ erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) compromised vascular endothelial
  cells and promoted local coagulation.
caption: 'CD45+ erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) compromised vascular endothelial
  cells and promoted local coagulation. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  pathway analysis of CD45+EPCs from spleen and tumor tissue of hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) tumor-bearing mice. (B) Expression of complement- and coagulation-related
  genes in CD45+EPCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumor tissue
  from one large tumor HCC patient, bone marrow from three tumor-free mouse and three
  tumor-bearing mouse, and spleen and orthotopic HCC tissue from three tumor-bearing
  mice, illustrated by RNA-seq. (C, D) ELISAs of FX, FVII, fibrinogen β chain (FGB),
  complement factor B (CFB), C4b, and complement factor H (CFH), in the conditioned
  media of CD45+EPCs from spleen and HCC tissue of tumor-bearing mice. (E) Cell migration
  and invasion assay: After 24 h of serum starving, 2×104 endothelial cells (ECs)
  were suspended in serum-free medium and seeded in the upper chamber. Media containing
  20% (v/v) FBS was placed into the lower chamber, as well as CD45+EPCs from the spleen
  of tumor-free mice, and the spleen and tumor tissue of tumor-bearing mice. After
  24 h (migration tests) or 72 h (invasion tests), cells adhered to the lower surface
  were evaluated. Tube formation assay: 1×105 ECs were cultured with conditioned medium
  of CD45+EPC from the spleen of tumor-free mice and the spleen and tumor tissue of
  tumor-bearing mice for 12 h. Representative of one independent experiment, cumulative
  data are shown (n = 6). (F) Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) analysis: ECs were cocultured
  with CD45+EPCs from above sources; 24, 36, 48, and 60 h post seeding, CD45+EPCs
  were washed and CCK8 analysis was conducted. Representative of one independent experiment,
  cumulative data are shown (n = 6). (G) ELISAs of FX, FVII, and FGB of the conditioned
  media of macrophage chemoattracted CD45+EPCs and CD45+EPC not being chemoattracted
  by macrophage. (H, I) Representative and statistical analysis of flow cytometric
  analysis of TGF-β, IL-10, and ROS on macrophage chemoattracted CD45+EPCs and CD45+EPCs
  not being chemoattracted by macrophage. (J) Neutralizing antibody of TGF-β (10 μg/mL)
  and CD45+EPCs from spleen or tumor tissue of tumor-bearing mice were administered
  into the lower chamber with ECs in the upper chamber. Migration of ECs was evaluated.
  (K) 1×105 ECs were cultured with conditioned medium of CD45+EPC from the spleen
  and tumor tissue of tumor-bearing mice for 12 h. αvβ3 (10 μg/mL) was added, and
  tube formation assay conducted. Representative of one independent experiment, cumulative
  data are shown (n = 6). ****p < 0.0001; ***p < 0.001; **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05. con:
