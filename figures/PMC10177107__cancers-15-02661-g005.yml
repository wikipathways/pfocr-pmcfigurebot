caption: '(1) Illustration indicating the mechanism of Rapamycin and paclitaxel nanoparticles
  in synergistically targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway via the suppression of Akt
  phosphorylation. (2) In vivo anticancer activity of Rapamycin and paclitaxel nanoparticles
  by targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway: (a) Inhibition of tumor growth
  after the administration of rapamycin nanoparticles (nRAP), paclitaxel nanoparticles
  (nPTX) and rapamycin-paclitaxel combination nanoparticles (nR/P) to MDA-MB-468 tumors-induced
  mice (mean ± SEM, n = 5). * Denotes that the results obtained are statistically
  significant as compared to what was found in the control group (* p < 0.05; ** p
  < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). (b) Relative expression of proteins involved in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway as determined by the reverse-phase protein array analysis of tumors excised
  24 h after treatment (mean ± SEM; n = 5). * Indicated statistical significance in
  comparison to control (* q < 0.1; ** q < 0.05; *** q < 0.005). (c) pS6 S235/236
  immunohistochemical staining of excised tumors 24 h after administration of nanoparticles.
