caption: (A) Schematic representation of Gram-negative cell wall and the enzymes of
  the Raetz Kdo2-Lipid A biosynthetic pathway, highlighting the placement of LpxH
  in the pathway (). For clarity, the UDP that is attached to the terminal phosphate
  for substrates up to the LpxH reaction is omitted from the figure. The product of
  the depicted reactions is Kdo2-Lipid A which is subsequently decorated with a core-oligosaccharide,
  flipped to the periplasmic-facing leaflet of the inner membrane, the O-antigen added,
  and ultimately directed to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane to form the LPS
  (). (B) LpxH (UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase) catalyzes the fourth step in
  lipid A synthesis, hydrolyzing UDP-2,3-bis(3-hydroxymyristoyl) glucosamine to yield
  2,3-bis(3-hydroxymyristoyl)-β-D-glucosaminyl 1-phosphate (lipid X) and uridine monophosphate.
