figure_title: Chemogenetic activation of the HPC-mPFC pathway do not improve anxiety-related
  behaviors in LPS-induced sepsis-associated encephalopathy.
caption: Chemogenetic activation of the HPC-mPFC pathway do not improve anxiety-related
  behaviors in LPS-induced sepsis-associated encephalopathy. (A-E) Activation of HPC-mPFC
  pathway did not alter LPS-induced anxiety-related behavior in the elevated plus
  maze (EPM) tests. (A) Representative searching paths on EPM. There were no significant
  differences in open arm entries (B), closed arm entries (C), time with open arm
  (D), and time with close arm (E) among LPS, Activator, and Inhibitors groups. (F-H)
  Activation of HPC-mPFC pathway did not improve LPS-induced anxiety-related behavior
  in the open field test (OFT). (F) Representative searching paths on OFT. (G) No
  significant difference was observed in time with center zone among LPS, Activator,
  and Inhibitors groups. (H) The distance moved in OFT (P > 0.05). Data were presented
  as mean Â± SEM. n=6/group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
