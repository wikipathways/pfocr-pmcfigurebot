figure_title: ZBTB20 increases TET1 expression and decreases the activity of the ERK
  signaling pathway in GBM cells.
caption: ZBTB20 increases TET1 expression and decreases the activity of the ERK signaling
  pathway in GBM cells. Analysis of the correlation between ZBTB20 and TET1 transcriptional
  expression in (A) LGG and (B) GBM tissues. The results were downloaded from the
  cBioPortal. Expression of TET1 in ZBTB20-overexpressing U251 cells was determined
  using (C) reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and (D) western
  blotting. (E) Histogram of the western blotting analysis of ZBTB20-overexpressing
  U251 cells. (F) Expression of key genes in the ERK signaling pathway were detected
  by western blotting, (G) which were semi-quantified and presented as histograms.
  All experiments were independent experiments and were repeated three times. Data
  are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. ERK, extracellular
  signal regulated kinase; CREB, cyclic AMP-responsive-element-binding protein; GBM,
  glioblastoma; LGG, lower grade glioma; NC, negative control; p-, phosphorylated;
  TET1, ten-eleven translocation 1; ZBTB20, zinc finger and BTB domain containing
  20
