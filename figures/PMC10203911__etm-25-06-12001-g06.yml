figure_title: Roflumilast activates the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway
  to decrease mitochondrial damage of H9C2 induced by H/R.
caption: 'Roflumilast activates the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway
  to decrease mitochondrial damage of H9C2 induced by H/R. (A) Changes of mitochondrial
  membrane potential in H/R-induced H9C2 cells with roflumilast and compound C treatment
  were detected by JC-1 staining. (B) ATP levels in H/R-induced H9C2 cells with roflumilast
  and compound C treatment were detected by ATP assay kit. (C) mPTP in H/R-induced
  H9C2 cells with roflumilast and compound C treatment was examined via a calcein-loading/CoCl2-quenching
  system (magnification, x100). (D) Quantification of mPTP opening level. (E) Expression
  of mitochondrial regulatory proteins in H/R-induced H9C2 cells with roflumilast
  and compound C treatment was determined by western blotting. ***P<0.001 vs. Control.
  ###P<0.001 vs. H/R. +P<0.05 and +++P<0.001 vs. H/R + roflumilast (5 µM) group. H/R,
  hypoxia/reoxygenation; mPTP, mitochondrial permeability transition pore; PINK1,
  PTEN-induced kinase 1; p, phosphorylated; DRP1, dynamin-related protein 1'
