caption: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results of the NOTCH signaling pathway.
  (A) Enrichment plot for the NOTCH signaling pathway in the NOTCH1‐rearranged versus
  wild‐type (WT) samples, showing the profile of the running enrichment score and
  positions of genes associated with this pathway on the rank‐ordered gene list. (B)
  Z‐scores of log2‐transformed TPM values of genes associated with the NOTCH signaling
  pathway within the complete T‐LBL cohort. Mean z‐scores are depicted for NOTCH1‐rearranged,
  NOTCH1‐mutated, and WT samples. Genes are ranked based on their position in the
  rank‐ordered gene list used for GSEA between NOTCH1‐rearranged and WT samples.
