caption: 'Combination treatment with gefitinib and TRQ inhibits the organoids growth.
  (A) Seven organoids were treated with TRQ or gefitinib or their combination for
  72 h, CellTiter-Glo® 3D Cell Viability Assay was performed to detect the cell viability
  (n = 7). (B) The Q value method was used to assess the combined effect in seven
  organoids. The Q values were calculated from the average inhibition rate of each
  group. (C) The mRNA expression of SOX2 in organoids was assayed by PCR (n = 3).
  (D) Representative morphology image and composite image in organoids (scale bars,
  50 μm) (n = 4). (E) Representative image of intracellular ROS (red, scale bars,
  100 μm) and mitochondrial superoxide (green, scale bars, 100 μm) in organoids (n
  = 3). The results were represented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05 versus the control group,
  #P < 0.05 versus the gefitinib alone group, **P or ##P < 0.01, ***P or ###P < 0.001.
  Ctrl, the control group; TRQ, Tanreqing injection; Gefi, gefitinib; SOX2, sex determining
  region Y-box 2.'
