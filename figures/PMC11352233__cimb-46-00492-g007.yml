caption: HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway in breast
  cancer. The HER2/EGFR signalling pathway in breast cancer involves the activation
  of HER2 and EGFR, which are tyrosine kinase receptors. When these receptors are
  overexpressed or mutated, they dimerise and activate downstream signalling cascades,
  including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. This leads to increased cell proliferation,
  survival, and metastasis. HER2-positive breast cancers are particularly aggressive
  but can be targeted with therapies like trastuzumab and pertuzumab, which block
  HER2 signalling
