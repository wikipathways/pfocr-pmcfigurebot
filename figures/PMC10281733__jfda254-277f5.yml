figure_title: Effects of Q3G on the LPS-induced mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in
  MRC-5 cells
caption: 'MRC-5 cells were pre-treated with or without Q3G (0.25 μM) for 6 h, and
  then co-incubated with LPS (10 μg/mL) for another 24 h. (A) The JC-1 (upper panel)
  and multicaspase activity (lower panel) were measured by Muse™ Cell Analyzer. (B)
  Quantitative analysis of ratio of JC-1 red/green fluorescent intensity. (C) The
  multicaspase activity was calculated as the percentage of the total caspase. The
  protein levels of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 (D), PARP-1, Bax and Bcl-2 (E)
  were analyzed by Western blotting. β-actin was served as an internal control. The
  quantitative data were presented as mean ± SD (n = 3) from three independent experiments.
  #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 compared with the control group via student’s t-test. *p <
  0.05, **p < 0.01 compared with the LPS group via student’s t-test'
