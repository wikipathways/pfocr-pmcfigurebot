  via the AMPK/mTOR/FOXO3a pathway in HeLa and SiHa cells.
caption: 'Sodium selenite induces proliferation inhibition, autophagy, and apoptosis
  via the AMPK/mTOR/FOXO3a pathway in HeLa and SiHa cells. (A) Protein expression
  levels in the AMPK/mTOR/FOXO3a pathway in HeLa and SiHa cells. (B) Localization
  of FOXO3a in the nucleus observed by confocal microscopy in HeLa cells. (C) Evaluation
  of glucose uptake ability using the 2-NBDG fluorescent glucose analog by confocal
  microscopy in HeLa cells. (D) Changes in the ADP/ATP ratio in HeLa cells. Changes
  in cell proliferation (E), the percentage of apoptotic cells (F), and the percentage
  of MDC-positive cells (I) in HeLa and SiHa cells after compound C pretreatment.
  (G) Expression of AMPK/mTOR/FOXO3a pathway proteins after compound C pretreatment
  in HeLa cells. (H) Analysis of autophagy- and apoptosis-related protein expression
  levels in HeLa cells. All results were repeated at least three times. # indicates
