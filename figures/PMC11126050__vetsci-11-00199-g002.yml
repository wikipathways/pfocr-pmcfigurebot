caption: BRAF signalling. (a) BRAF functions in the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) signalling pathway, downstream of RAS. (b) Extracellular proliferative signals,
  such as growth factors (GF), activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which in
  turn activate the RAS family. This induces dimerisation and activation of BRAF,
  leading to a signalling cascade of kinases, from MEK to ERK. Activated ERK can stimulate
  transcription, resulting in cell growth, proliferation, and survival. (c) Activating
  mutations in BRAF, such as BRAFV600E confer constitutive activation of the MAPK
  pathway and result in uncontrolled cell proliferation and, in some cases, metastasis.
  (d) Small-molecule BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) selectively target BRAF and thus block
  mutant BRAF-induced activation of the MAPK signalling pathway that regulates the
  proliferation and survival of the tumour cells
