figure_title: Identification and analysis of E75 and E125 differentially expressed
  (DE) messenger RNAs (mRNAs).
caption: Identification and analysis of E75 and E125 differentially expressed (DE)
  messenger RNAs (mRNAs). (a) Violin plots of gene expression patterns for each sample.
  (b) Venn diagram of mRNA distribution across samples, where the overlap represents
  consensus mRNA for two sample types. (c) Volcano plots of log2-fold change (FC)
  for E75 and E125 mRNA. (d) Cluster analysis heatmap. (e) Gene Ontology (GO) functional
  annotations. (f,g) GO functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) signalling pathway enrichment. Circle size and colour represent the
  degree of enrichment and enrichment significance, respectively
