caption: 'Analysis of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways and determination of peroxidase
  (POD) enzyme activity in maize radicles of DMY1 and ZD958 under TS. (A) Metabolic
  changes in DMY1 and ZD958 under TS. (B) Transcriptional changes in DMY1 and ZD958
  genes under TS. (C) Changes in POD activity in the radicles of DMY1 (a) and ZD958
  (b) germinated seeds after incubation under CT or TS conditions for 48 h, respectively.
  DCT: control treatment of DMY1; DTS: low-temperature treatment of DMY1; ZCT: control
  treatment of ZD958; ZTS: low-temperature treatment of ZD958'
