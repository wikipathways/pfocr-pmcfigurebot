caption: Propionate regulates expression of STIM1 and STING. Salivary gland tissue
  was stained for STIM1 and phospho-STING. A Representative images of STIM1 in the
  salivary gland and average numbers of STIM1-positive cells. B Representative images
  of phosph0-STING in the salivary gland and average numbers of phosphor-STING-positive
  cells. C Splenocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 (0.5 µg/mL) in the absence or
  presence of propionate (0.2 or 1 mM) for 48 h and harvested for flow cytometry.
  FACS plots show percentages of type I IFN–positive cells. Bar graphs show average
  percentages of type I IFN–producing dendritic cells. D Percentages of Th1 (CD4+IFN-γ+)
  and Th17 (CD4+IL-17.+) cells. Data are means ± SD (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001)
