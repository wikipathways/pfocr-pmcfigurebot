caption: STM0306 causes host cell inflammation through the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (A) Relative mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokine genes of IPEC-J2 (n = 6).
  (B) Protein expression analysis of IPEC-J2 cells by Western blot; the densitometric
  analysis shows the level of p-p65 over GAPDH (n = 3). All results are shown as the
  mean ± standard error, * means p < 0.05, and ** means p < 0.01
