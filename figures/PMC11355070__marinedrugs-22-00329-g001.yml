figure_title: Schematic overview of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway.
caption: Schematic overview of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. The carotenoid
  biosynthesis starts with the synthesis of isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) through
  either the mevalonate (MVA) pathway or the methyl-D-erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway
  located in the chloroplast [40]. IPP isomerizes to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)
  and together they produce the immediate precursor of the carotenoid synthesis, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate (GGPP). The condensation of two GGPP molecules leads to the formation
  of a colorless carotene, phytoene, by enzyme phytoene synthase (PSY). This PSY-catalyzed
  reaction is known to be the most important rate-limiting step in the carotenoid
  biosynthetic pathway [41]. Phytoene is converted to lycopene via a multi-step desaturation
  reaction catalyzed by phytoene desaturase (PDS) and ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS)
  [42]. The cyclization of lycopene is the branching point of the carotenoid synthesis
  pathway into an α-branch and β-branch. In the α-branch, lycopene-ε-cyclase (LCYE)
  and lycopene β-cyclase (LCYB) catalyze lycopene to α-carotene, and then cytochrome
  P450 β-hydroxylase (CYPC97A) and cytochrome P450 ε-hydroxylase (CYPC97C) convert
  α-carotene to lutein [40]. In the β-branch, lycopene β-cyclase (LCYB) catalyzes
  lycopene to β-carotene, which is further hydroxylated by β-carotene hydroxylase
  (BCH) to form zeaxanthin [7]. Zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) then converts zeaxanthin
  to violaxanthin. Violaxanthin can be converted to neoxanthin or enter the xanthophyll
  cycle, where it can be reversibly converted back to zeaxanthin via antheraxanthin
  to balance light harvesting and photoprotection
