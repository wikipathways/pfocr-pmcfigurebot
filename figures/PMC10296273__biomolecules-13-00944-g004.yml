caption: Nucleus-to-mitochondria communication pathways. Mitochondria communicate
  with the nucleus via retrograde (RTG) signaling pathways which are triggered on
  detection of mitochondrial dysfunction. The nucleus responds by anterograde signaling
  pathways. Environmental effects can trigger either RTG or anterograde signaling
  cascades
