caption: GOrilla reveals the GO terms in the process gene ontology domains, enriched
  with genes differentially expressed in 18Aβ when compared to 3Aβ, the image shows
  the magnification of Figure S2 in Supplementary Material 3 (a) and in 18Aβ when
  compared to 18Vh (b). The pathway analysis of 18Aβ vs. 3Aβ (a) was conducted on
  1273 differentially expressed genes, and 18Aβ vs. 18Vh (b) was conducted on 182
  differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05). Yellow squares represent the GO terms
  with 10−3 < p < 10−5, and orange squares represent 10−5 < p < 10−7
