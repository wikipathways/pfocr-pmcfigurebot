figure_title: Development of groundnut 4RNAi-HIGS lines.
caption: 'Development of groundnut 4RNAi-HIGS lines. (A) Circular map of the 4RNAi
  binary vector used for groundnut transformation. (B) Linear representation of T-DNA
  region of the 4RNAi binary vector containing the constitutive enhanced cauliflower
  mosaic virus (d35S CaMV) promoter used for targeting the aflatoxin pathway genes.
  The hpRNA cassettes have inverted repeats of respective nsdC, veA, aflM, and aflR
  gene regions highlighted in purple, orange, red and green color respectively under
  control of the d35S CaMV promoter. LB left border; RB, right border. (C) PCR analysis
  using the 4RNAi primer pair to confirm the presence of 4RNAi genes (820 bp) and
  the primer pair specific for the PDK intron. (D) RT-PCR analysis of 4RNAi events.
  cDNA from HIGS and WT control were used to amplify the inserted transgene with amplicon
  sizes of 508 bp using the 4RNAi2 primer pair and primers specific for the endogenous
  gene (ADH3), (E) Relative transcript expression of A. flavus nsdC, veA, aflR, and
  aflM from infected 4RNAi lines and the WT control line. Quantitative RT-PCR of RNAs
  isolated from 48 hpi (hours post infection) samples used the A. flavus housekeeping
  gene, beta-tubulin, as the normalizer. Significant differences between HIGS and
  wild-type control plants were analyzed through Dunnett test: * p < 0.05; ** p <
