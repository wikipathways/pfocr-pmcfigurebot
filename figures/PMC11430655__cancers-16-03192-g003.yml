caption: 'Schematic of the RAGE signaling pathway in EC and potential therapeutic
  targets. High glucose levels, oxidative stress, and local inflammation activate
  the RAGE signaling pathway. The V domain (extracellular domain) of RAGE interacts
  with HMGB1, S100B, and AGEs. HMGB1, S100B, and AGEs are proinflammatory RAGE ligands.
  Diaph1 interacts with the cytoplasmatic domain. Studies have indicated that Diaph1
  may be a crucial player in the downstream RAGE signaling pathway. The signal cascade
  activates transcription factors (NFKB, STAT) that increase the amount of proinflammatory
  cytokines. Moreover, inhibiting the RAGE-Diaph1 interaction may contribute to reducing
  the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, DNA methylation may have a
  key impact on RAGE-dependent cell signaling. Local environmental factors, hyperglycemia,
  oxidative stress, and inflammation may induce malfunctions in DNA methylation and,
  thus, disturb the epigenetic pattern of RAGE signaling pathways. Abbreviations:
  AGEs—advanced glycation end-products; RAGE—receptor for advanced glycation end-products;
  S100B—S100 calcium-binding protein B; HMGB1—high-mobility group box 1; Diaph1—diaphanous
  related formin 1; NFKB—nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B
  cells; STAT—signal transducer and activator of transcription; JAK—Janus-activated
  kinases'
