  through inhibiting mTORC1/S6K/eIF-4B signaling pathway in vitro.
caption: 'Ltf represses TGF-β-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation through
  inhibiting mTORC1/S6K/eIF-4B signaling pathway in vitro. A. Schematic showing primary
  cardiac fibroblasts treated with TGF-β, Ltf and MHY1485. B-C. Proliferation assay
  of fibroblasts via CCK-8 assay (B, n = 8/ea) and immunofluorescent staining with
  Ki67 (C, n = 6/ea) 24 hours after treatment. D. Representative Western blot and
  quantifications of indicated proteins. n = 6/ea. E-F. Representative immunofluorescent
  micrographs (E) and quantification of fluorescence intensity (F) in fibroblasts
  stained with antibody against α-SMA, Col1, Col3 and Postn. n = 6/ea. G. Representative
  micrographs of transwell assay. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. B, C and D, by
  one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test; F, by Mann-Whitney non-parametric
  test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001, ***P < 0.001 compared with corresponding group. ###P
  < 0.001 compared with control group'
