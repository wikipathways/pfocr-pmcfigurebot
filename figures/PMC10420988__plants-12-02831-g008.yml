figure_title: Gene expression analysis of chlorophyll and carotenoid-associated genes.
caption: Gene expression analysis of chlorophyll and carotenoid-associated genes.
  (A) Common pathway, (B) Chlorophyll-specific biosynthesis pathway, (C) Chlorophyll
  cycle pathway, (D) Chlorophyll degradation pathway, (E) LHC degradation pathway,
  (F) LHC synthesis pathway, (G) Carotenoid substrate supply (MEP pathway), (H) Carotene
  biosynthesis pathway, (I) Xanthophyll biosynthesis pathway, and (J) Carotenoid degradation
  pathway. Different gene expression was determined by DEseq2 and red and blue color
  indicate decreased and increased gene expression level in yellow seedling compared
  to green seedling. Adjusted p value was used for statistically significance level
  of difference based on the Wald test
