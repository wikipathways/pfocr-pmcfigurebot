figure_title: Effects of MFE on the Akt signaling pathway in CHO-K1 cells.
caption: 'Effects of MFE on the Akt signaling pathway in CHO-K1 cells. (a) Representative
  images of Western blotting bands for Akt signaling pathway-related proteins. CHO-K1
  cells were treated with 100 µg/mL MFE for the specified durations, and extracted
  proteins were immunoblotted using antibodies related to the Akt signaling pathway.
  (b) Quantification of Western blot bands. The intensity of each band was measured
  using densitometry with ImageJ 1.52a software and expressed as the ratios of p-Akt/Akt,
  p-mTOR/mTOR, p-p70S6K/p70S6K, and p-4EBP1/β-actin. Results are presented as the
  ratio of the experimental group to the control group, with the control group value
  normalized to 1. Significant vs. vehicle-treated controls, *** p < 0.001, ** p <
  0.01, * p < 0.05. (c) Attenuation of the protective effect of MFE by LY294002. After
  pretreating the cells with LY294002 (20 µM) for 1 h, they were then treated with
  100 µg/mL MFE for 1 h, followed by exposure to 1.5 mM of VCD for 24 h. Subsequently,
  cell viability was measured. Significant vs. vehicle-treated controls, ### p < 0.001;
  significant vs. VCD-treated cells, *** p < 0.001'
