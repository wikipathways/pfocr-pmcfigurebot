caption: Prediction of the ceRNA complex constructed by lncRNA 220 and its targeted
  miRNAs. (A) Prediction of the targeted miRNAs of 220. (B) Venn plot of the overlapping
  downstream mRNA targets of miR-5101, miR-669b-5p, and miR-7234-5p. (C) Interactive
  plot of downstream targeted mRNAs of 5101. (D) Interactive plot of 10 hub targeted
  mRNAs of 5101 screened out by Cytoscape (the hue of the icon symbolizes the significance
  of genes, with a deeper red hue indicating a greater degree of importance). (E)
  GO/KEGG enrichment analysis for the hub targeted mRNAs (the manifestation of the
  hub targeted mRNAsâ€™ participation in the PI3K pathway is exhibited within the red-dashed
  enclosure). (F) Sankey plot of ceRNA complex formed by 220 and 5101 (the color used
  in this plot is primarily employed for the purpose of designating each variable
  and its interrelation). (G) Prediction of the regulatory pathway involving the interaction
  of 220 and 5101
