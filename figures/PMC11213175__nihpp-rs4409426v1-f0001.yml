figure_title: Death receptor signaling via caspase-8 pathway
caption: |-
  (a) A schematic diagram of the Fas-mediated death receptor signaling pathway in wild-type and caspase-8 mutant (Casp8DA/DA) mice. When Fas ligand engages the Fas receptor, pro-caspase-8 is directly recruited to the death-induced signaling complex (DISC) by the adapter proteins FADD and TRADD. Pro-caspase-8 undergoes autocleavage at D387 to produce catalytically active caspase-8 that leads to apoptosis via downstream activation of effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. The recruitment of pro-caspase-8 to the DISC also upregulates immune cell activation inflammation via MAP-kinase and NF- κB pathways, and autocleavage of caspase-8 is not required for this function. A point mutation at the auto-cleavage site, D387A, prevents caspase-8 activation and blocks caspase-8-mediated apoptosis; however, it does not block caspase-8-mediated inflammation.

  (b) A DNA gel depicting typical genotyping results of a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay showing expected sizes of HinFI undigested (–) and digested (+) PCR amplicon products produced from genomic DNA of mice from the indicated genotypes. Both wild-type and Casp8DA/DA produce a 300-base pair PCR amplicon and following restriction digestion with HinFI, two fragments of 150-base pair appear in Casp8DA/DA but not in wild-type mice
