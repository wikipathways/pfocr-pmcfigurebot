caption: Initiating of tumour dormancy and types of dormancy in breast cancer. (A)
  The three potential pathways for breast tumour cells that break away from their
  primary tumour. (B) Biological mechanisms of hibernating breast cancer cells. Cancer
  dormancy can be classified physiologically into cellular dormancy and metastatic
  dormancy. Cancer progresses during cellular dormancy, when dormant malignant cells
  re-enter the cell cycle. Similarly, metastatic dormancy progresses when an angiogenic
  switch occurs or tumour cells avoid immune checkpoints, causing the imbalance between
  proliferation and death to shift towards the benefit of proliferation
