caption: The role of VEGFA in the epithelial immune microenvironment of psoriasis.
  Th17 cell is a product of IL-17A. IL-17A associated with TNF-α stimulates keratinocytes
  to produce VEGFA. On the one hand, VEGFA induces pDCs to release chemerin and IFN-α,
  promoting the proliferation of HDMECs and endothelial cells. On the other hand,
  VEGFA, in combination with VEGFR1/Flt1 and VEGFR2/Flk1, activates downstream pathways
