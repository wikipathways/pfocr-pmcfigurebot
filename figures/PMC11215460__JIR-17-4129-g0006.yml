caption: 'The overexpression of PKP2 in CLS, where acute inflammation occurs, triggers
  the activation of the p38/MAPK signaling pathway. (A) Western blot analysis revealed
  that PKP2 overexpression significantly increased the overall expression of phosphorylated
  p38 protein in HUVECs upon stimulation with LPS (data represent the results of three
  independent experiments). (B) Following LPS stimulation, SB203580 downregulated
  the mRNA expression levels of connexin43, occludin, and VE-cadherin in HUVECs with
  elevated PKP2 overexpression (data represent the results of three independent experiments).
  (C) Following LPS stimulation, SB203580 reduced the protein levels of ZO-1, Î²-catenin,
  p-p38/p38, and claudin1 in HUVECs overexpressing PKP2 (data represent the results
  of three independent experiments). The levels were compared to that of GAPDH, which
  served as the reference. (D) Immunofluorescence assay revealed that SB203580 downregulated
  claudin1 expression in LPS-treated PKP2 overexpressed HUVECs (data represent the
  results of three independent experiments). (E) SB203580 further decreased the permeability
  of PKP2 overexpressed HUVECs stimulated with LPS (data represent the results of
  three independent experiments). (F) SB203580 exacerbated cytoskeletal disorders
  induced by LPS treatment in PKP2 overexpressed HUVECs (data represent the results
  of three independent experiments). SB203580: Inhibitor of the p38/MAPK signaling
  pathway. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, ns p > 0.05.'
