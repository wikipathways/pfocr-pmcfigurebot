figure_title: Impact of tick EVs on wound healing pathways through the DETC-keratinocyte
  axis
caption: '(A-F) Individual tSNE plots of keratinocyte clusters: (A) FVB-Jax, (B) FVB-Jax
  scV33, (C) FVB-Jax siV33, (D) FVB-Tac (E) FVB-Tac scV33, and (F) FVB-Tac siV33.
  (G) Enriched pathways in the unidentified cell cluster (as shown in C) based on
  functional annotation in DAVID. Fold enrichment is indicated in a Log2 scale. *p
  value and FDR<0.05 were set as threshold. KEGG, GO and InterPro were used as reference
  annotation databases. (H) Ingenuity pathway analysis comparing keratinocytes of
  skin biopsies from FVB-Jax siV33 to FVB-Jax scV33. Blue denotes pathways predicted
  to be inhibited (negative z-score) whereas orange indicates pathways predicted to
  be activated (positive z-score) based on default parameters. Differential expression
  datasets were assessed for canonical pathway analysis. Results are shown in a âˆ’log
  (p-value) scale. *p value and FDR< 0.05 were set as threshold. (I) Volcano plot
  of genes representing the wound healing signaling pathway in keratinocytes of FVB-Jax
  siV33 compared to FVB-Jax scV33 datasets (highlighted in yellow; H). Blue denotes
  decrease whereas red indicates increase in the coefficient (coef) of expression.
  (J) Dot plot of the top 5 marker genes present in the keratinocyte clusters (as
  shown in A-F). Average gene expression is demarked by the intensity of color. Percent
  of gene expression within individual clusters is represented by the dot diameter.
  (K) Expression of Col1a1 on t-SNE plot of keratinocyte clusters'
