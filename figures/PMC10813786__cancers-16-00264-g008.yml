caption: Attenuation of WNT signaling by induced wt-APC expression decreases CYP26A1
  and increases progression through the RA pathway. High WNT signaling levels correlate
  with a mutant APC genotype. In this case, when ATRA is administered, CYP26A1 is
  overexpressed, which increases metabolism of ATRA into hydroxy retinoic acid, thereby
  preventing differentiation of SCs. When wt-APC expression is induced, components
  of the WNT signaling pathway, including CYP26A1, are not highly expressed. In this
  situation, when ATRA is administered, it binds to CRABP, enters the nucleus, and
  activates transcription of RA response genes, which induces differentiation of SCs
  and subsequent cell death
