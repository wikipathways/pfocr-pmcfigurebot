caption: Factors that balance free and conjugated ISG15 during the immune response.
  1. Binding of interferon (IFN) to the interferon receptor (IFNR) results in a conformational
  change that enables the transphosphorylation of associated Janus Kinase (JAK). The
  activated JAK then phosphorylates adjacent signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) proteins. 2. Phosphorylated STAT dimers migrate to the nucleus where they
  bind to interferon-sensitive response elements (ISRE) inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs), among them are ISG15, ISG15 conjugating enzymes (e.g. UBE1L, UBE2L6,
  HERC5), and its specific deISGylase (DIG), USP18). 3. HERC5, the major ISG15 E3
  ligase may interact with the ribosome where it massively labels synthesized proteins
  (from both host or viral transcripts) as they emerge from the ribosome (3a). An
  as-yet-unidentified E3 may interact with a ubiquitous protein signal such as ubiquitin
  to generate mixed Ub-ISG15 modifications on target proteins (3b). 4. ISGylation
  contributes to innate immune response and inhibits viral replication, though the
  precise mechanism remains elusive. 5. ISGylation is overturned by USP18, a DIG that
  can remove ISG15 from a substrate releasing free ISG15. 6. The free form of ISG15
  can be conjugated to new targets (by HERC5 and other E3 ligases), or stabilize USP18,
  a known inhibitor of the STAT-JAK pathway (unrelated to its catalytic DIG activity)
  thereby inhibiting the innate immune response. Free ISG15 can also be secreted from
  the cell and act as a cytokine-like protein thereby enhancing the host immune response.
  7. Some viruses evolved the ability to bypass the ISG15 pathway. Coronaviruses encode
  a PLpro enzyme that can cleave Ub or ISG15 from conjugates (in addition to cutting
  the viral polypeptide precursors, PP1a, PP1ab, into an array of functional proteins
  (NSPs) initiating the replication of the virus). 8. By counteracting the conjugating
  pathway, the virus generates free ISG15. |Deconjugating ISG15 may benefit the virus
  to bypass the host's innate immune response, but the formation of free ISG15 could
  also alert neighboring cells (6).
