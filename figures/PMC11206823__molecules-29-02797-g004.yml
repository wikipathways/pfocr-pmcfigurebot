figure_title: GO and KEGG analyses of differential expressions of miRNAs caused by
  GHaK treatment.
caption: GO and KEGG analyses of differential expressions of miRNAs caused by GHaK
  treatment. (A). GO analysis exhibited up-regulated miRNAs caused by GHaK treatment
  on PC-9 cells in terms of the top 10 categories in BB, CC, and MF. (B). GO analysis
  exhibited down-regulated miRNAs caused by GHaK treatment on PC-9 cells in terms
  of the top 10 categories in BB, CC, and MF. (C). KEGG analysis showed up-regulated
  miRNAs distributed in the top 10 pathways caused by GHaK treatment on PC-9 cells.
  (D). KEGG analysis showed down-regulated miRNAs distributed in the top 10 pathways
  caused by GHaK treatment on PC-9 cells. Red box indicated the pathway would be validated
