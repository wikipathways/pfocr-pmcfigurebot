figure_title: SOM+ interneurons exhibit heterogeneous regulation by DORs
caption: 'A: Cartoon depicting injection schedule for PTx electrophysiology experiments.
  Two stereotaxic surgeries are performed on SOM-Cre mice; slices are obtained 3-4
  weeks after injection of DIO-ChR2 and 1-3 days after injection of PTx (0.5 μg/μL).B:
  Example EPSC traces in L5 pyramidal neurons evoked by electrical stimulation before
  and after application of baclofen (1 μM) in control mice (left) or those locally-injected
  with PTx (right). Below: Summary plot of normalized eEPSC amplitudes after baclofen
  application.C: Example SOM-oIPSC traces before and after DPDPE with either external
  H89 (top) or injected PTx (bottom).D: Summary plot of normalized oIPSC amplitudes
  after DPDPE in control, H89, and PTx conditions.E: Normalized amplitude-PPR plot
  depicting slope relationships for control SOM-oIPSCs after DPDPE, compared to those
  in the presence of H89 or PTx. Yellow line depicts benchmark low Ca eIPSC relationship
  from Figure 1.F: Z-stack image of filled SOM+ interneuron. White box indicates the
  bouton imaging region, which is enlarged and rotated as a zoomed-in inset (bottom).
  Scale bars, main image: 20 μm, inset: 2 μm.G: Top: Voltage trace of AP triplet evoked
  by step protocol (middle). Bottom: time vs. fluorescence intensity image of Alexa
  594 (red) and Fluo-5F (green) signals.H: Summary plot of normalized ΔG/R peaks over
  time comparing vehicle and DPDPE group averages.I: Example AP-evoked Ca transients
  before and after DPDPE with either H89, locally-injected PTx, or both.J: Summary
  plot of normalized ΔG/R peaks across vehicle and drug conditions. *** p<0.001.K:
