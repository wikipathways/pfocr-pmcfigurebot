caption: Construction of an individualized predictive model for aGVHD. (a) Univariate
  and multivariate logistic regression analyses of relationship between four genes
  in P53 pathway and aGVHD development. OR, odds ratio, calculates the relationship
  between each gene in P53 pathway and the likelihood of aGVHD occurrence. OR smaller
  than one implies aGVHD has fewer odds of happening with high expression of genes
  in P53 pathway. The blue dots represent OR values, which may not be seen if it exceeds
  the range of ruler below. The blue lines represent 95% CI of OR. (b) Nomogram depicting
  the prediction of aGVHD occurrence. The aGVHD nomogram consists of four P53 pathway
  genes, namely, DDIT3, TPRKB, TOB1 and FBXW7. The expression value of each gene can
  match a point on the top. For an individual patient, the total points of four genes
  correspond to the risk of aGVHD. (c) Calibration curve of nomogram for aGVHD prediction.
  The concordance between lines Apparent and Ideal implies the congruence between
  actual and ideal nomogram. (d) The ROC curves and (e) DCA of the diagnostic efficacy
  verification. During DCA, it represents a good clinical value when the interested
  curve (marked in red) lies in the upper right quadrant formed by the other two curve.
