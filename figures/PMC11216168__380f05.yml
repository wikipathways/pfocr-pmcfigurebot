caption: NHR-49 is sufficient to enhance stress resilience, proteostasis, and the
  HSR and acts in an HSF-1-dependent manner. (A) Heat stress survival of wild type
  and cbd-1(ok2913) mutants crossed into the nhr-49(et7) gain-of-function allele (n
  = 3). (B) Heat stress survival of nhr-49(nr2041) and tissue-specific NHR-49::GFP
  overexpression strains (n = 3). (C) Representative confocal images of day 5 adults
  expressing Q35::mCherry in intestinal cells, with the corresponding bright-field
  images shown in the insets. (D) Quantification of Q35::mCherry aggregates in day
  5 adults. Wild type, n = 112; nhr-49(et7), n = 106. (E) Expression of heat shock
  genes relative to cdc-42 in wild-type animals exposed for 1 h to 33°C heat shock
  (n = 5). (F) Heat stress survival of wild-type or nhr-49(et7) animals grown on either
  control or hsf-1 RNAi (n = 3). (G) Model for regulation of organismal stress resilience
  and proteostasis by NHR-49. Embryo damage, reduced insulin signaling, or food scarcity
  can activate NHR-49, which, together with its coactivator, MDT-15, induces the expression
  of genes involved in lipid catabolism. This includes daf-22, which contributes to
  stress resilience. NHR-49 activation also leads to potentiation of HSF-1 activity
  and enhancement of the HSR, resulting in improved stress resilience and proteostasis.
  The beneficial effects of daf-22 may occur via HSF-1 or through a parallel pathway.
  Error bars represent SEM. Statistical significance was based on two-way ANOVA (A,B,F)
  or unpaired t-test (D,E). (*) P < 0.05, (**) P < 0.01, (***) P < 0.001, (ns [nonsignificant])
  P > 0.05.
