  cells via melatonin/T3.
caption: The AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of granulosa
  cells via melatonin/T3. A/B protein was extracted at 0 min, 30 min, 1 h, 6 h, 12
  h and 24 h after melatonin/T3 co-treatment. The protein expression of AMPK (A),
  SIRT1 (B), AMH (C) and GRP78 (D) was determined by Western blotting. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01, compared with 0 min; + p < 0.05, ++ p < 0.01, compared with melatonin/T3
