caption: Graphical summary of ASC-EVs’ therapeutic effects on systemic sclerosis model.
  ASC-EVs inhibit the TGF-β signaling pathway by decreasing the phosphorylation and
  nuclear localization of SMAD2. Moreover, ASC-EVs affect to survival and viability
  of myofibroblasts through the modulation of phosphorylated AKT and BCL-2 protein
  levels. Consequently, ASC-EVs downregulate the expression of fibrotic genes and
  reduce the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins in both mouse and human
  dermal fibroblasts.
