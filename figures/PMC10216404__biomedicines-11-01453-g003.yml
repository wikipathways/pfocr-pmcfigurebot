figure_title: The effects of RSV on MAPK (ERK 1/2/, p38 MAPK and JNK) signalling pathways.
caption: 'The effects of RSV on MAPK (ERK 1/2/, p38 MAPK and JNK) signalling pathways.
  The activation of MAPKs pathway results in the upregulation of osteogenic genes
  which favours osteoblastogenesis. FoxO1 transcriptional activity increases in response
  to PI3K/AKT signalling inhibition, which lowers oxidative stress. The generation
  of inflammatory cytokines that promote osteoclast differentiation or activation
  can be reduced through CREB phosphorylation in MAPK signalling suppression. Abbreviations:
  MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK 1/2: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases; RunX2:
  runt-related transcription factor; ALP: Alkaline phosphatase; OCN: Osteocalcin;
  ONN: Osteonectin; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Akt: protein kinase B; CREB:
  Cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein; iNOS: nitric oxide synthase;
  Cox2: cyclooxygenase-2; TNFÎ±: tumour necrosis alpha; IL-1: Interleukin-1; IL-6:
  Interleukin-6'
