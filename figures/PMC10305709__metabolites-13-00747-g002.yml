caption: Modification of glucose uptake pathway and introduction of feedback-resistant
  DAHP synthase. (a) Effects of application of non-PTS systems from E. coli and C.
  glutamicum on the bacterial growth. (b) Effects of expression of aroGfbr mutants
  on biomass accumulation, shikimate and DHS production. Values are presented as mean
  Â± SD. * p < 0.05, indicates statistically different; *** p < 0.001, indicates highly
  significant
