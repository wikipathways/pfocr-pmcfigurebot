caption: Tumor cell-released autophagosomes (TRAPs) induce neutrophil extracellular
  trap (NET) formation via the HMGB1-TLR4-Myd88-ERK/p38 signaling pathway. (A,B) Mouse
  neutrophils were stimulated with protease K, or ultrasonically treated TRAPs for
  3 hours. (A) NETs were examined for DNA (DAPI and SYTOX Green) by fluorescence microscopy,
  and (B) the levels of dsDNA and myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA) complexes in culture
  supernatants were detected by ELISA. (C) TRAPs pretreated with or without α-HSP27,
  α-HSP60, α-HSP70, α-HSP90, or α-HMGB1 blocking antibodies, were used to stimulate
  mouse neutrophils for 3 hours, and then dsDNA and MPO-DNA complexes were detected
  in culture supernatants. (D,E) Mouse neutrophils were subjected to TRAP Hmgb1 KD
  or TRAP Hmgb1 NC treatment for 3 hours, (D) NETs were identified by DNA (DAPI and
  SYTOX Green) by fluorescence microscopy, (E) and the levels of dsDNA and MPO-DNA
  complexes were detected in culture supernatants. (F) Schematic overview of the mouse
  tail vein injection with NS, TRAP Hmgb1 KD, or TRAP Hmgb1 NC. (G) Levels of dsDNA
  and MPO-DNA complexes in the plasma of mice were detected. (H,I) Representative
  images of immunofluorescence staining for DNA (blue), MPO (green), and H3Cit (red)
  in lung tissues on day 10. (J,K) Neutrophils pretreated with described inhibitor,
  or solvent control (DMSO) solutions for 2 hours, were then stimulated with TRAPs
  for 3 hours. (J) NETs were examined for DNA (DAPI and SYTOX Green) by fluorescence
  microscopy, and (K) culture supernatants were collected to detect dsDNA and MPO-DNA
  complexes. (L) Neutrophils from control and TLR4-knockout mice were stimulated with
  TRAPs for 3 hours, and the levels of dsDNA and MPO-DNA complexes in the culture
  supernatants were detected. (M) Western blotting analyses of ERK and p38 protein
  phosphorylation in neutrophils treated with TRAPs at different time points. (N)
  Neutrophils pretreated with ERK and p38 pathway inhibitors for 1 hour were stimulated
  with TRAPs for 3 hours, and the levels of dsDNA and MPO-DNA complexes in the culture
  supernatants were determined. (O) Western blotting analysis of ERK and p38 protein
  phosphorylation in neutrophils treated with TRAP Hmgb1 KD and TRAP Hmgb1 NC. (P)
  Neutrophils pretreated with described inhibitors for 2 hours were then stimulated
  with TRAPs for 1 hour. Western blotting was used to detect the phosphorylation of
  ERK and P38 proteins. Data (mean±SEM) represent three independent experiments (*p< 0.05;
  **p< 0.01; ***p< 0.001; ****p< 0.0001; NS, not significant).
