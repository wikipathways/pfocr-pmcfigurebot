caption: Placental TNF family signaling pathway molecules during SHS or eCig treatment.
  Inflammatory mediators were determined in treated animals as compared to controls.
  Protein expression of TNF-α (A), TNF RII (B), CD 30 ligand (C), Fas ligand (D),
  TACI (E), and GITR ligand (F) was differently regulated by length and type of treatment
  when compared to controls. Significant differences are noted as * p ≤ 0.05
