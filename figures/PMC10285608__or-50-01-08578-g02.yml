caption: PC cells induce an insulin-resistant phenotype in cocultured adipocytes.
  (A) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis plots of enrichment in ‘KEGG_Insulin_signaling_pathway’
  (up), ‘HALLMARK_IL6_JAK_STAT3_signaling’ (down) signatures in adipocytes cultured
  with or without cancer cells (n=3). (B) Leading-edge genes of insulin signaling
  pathway signature described in (A). Red indicates upregulation, and blue indicates
  downregulation. (C) Immunoblots of total and p-STAT3 in adipocytes cultured alone
  or with Panc-1 (left) and MIA PaCa2 for 5 days. (D and E) Immunoblot analysis of
  (D) p-STAT3 and (E) qPCR analysis of insulin signaling genes in 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes
  treated with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) in medium containing 10% FBS for 48 h. (F) qPCR analysis
  of SOCS3 expression changes in adipocytes treated with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) or cocultured
  with Panc-1 and MIA PaCa2 PC cells. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation.
