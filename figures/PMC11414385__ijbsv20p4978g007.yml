figure_title: Role of E2F4 in Promoting Malignancy in GC Cells.
caption: Role of E2F4 in Promoting Malignancy in GC Cells. (A-B) Impact of E2F4 knockdown
  or overexpression on GC cell proliferation assessed through CCK-8 assay (A) and
  EdU assay (B). (C) Influence of E2F4 knockdown or overexpression on GC cell cycle
  analyzed using flow cytometry. (D) Effect of E2F4 knockdown or overexpression on
  GC cell proliferation measured by colony formation assay. (E-F) Impact of E2F4 knockdown
  or overexpression on GC cell migration and invasion evaluated through transwell
  (E) and wound healing assay (F). (G) GSEA analysis illustrating the correlation
  between E2F4 expression and the cell cycle pathway. (H) Alterations in cell cycle,
  proliferation, migration, and invasion-related proteins following E2F4 knockdown
  or overexpression analyzed by Western blot in GC cells. (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001,
