caption: Gene family expression (presented by FPKM) of T2DM-related pathways from
  RD cells treated with DMSO, PHE, and VPA. Cells were treated with DMSO, PHE (79
  μM), and VPA (693.4 μM) for 72 h; mRNA was extracted; and RNA-Seq and DEG analyses
  were performed. (A) KEGG adipocytokine signaling pathway; (B) KEGG T2DM pathway;
  (C) BIOCARTA PPARA pathway; (D) Reactome regulation of lipid metabolism by PPARα;
  (E) KEGG PPAR signaling pathway. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
