caption: Effects of Nano-ZnO supplementation on the expression of proteins related
  to the Nrf2-GCL signaling pathway of LD tissues in IUGR pigs (n = 6). NBW, normal-born
  weight pigs; IUGR, intrauterine growth restriction pigs; IUGR + Zn, IUGR pigs fed
  with diets supplemented with 600 mg/kg Nano-ZnO. (A) Western blot of nuclear Nrf2
  and LaminB1 proteins; (B) Western blot of Nrf2, Keap1 and GAPDH proteins; (C) Western
  blot of GCLC, GCLM and GAPDH proteins; (D) Relative expression of proteins nuclear
  Nrf2 /LaminB1; (Eâ€“H) Relative expression of proteins Nrf2/GAPDH, Keap1/GAPDH, GCLC/GAPDH,
  GCLM/GAPDH. Mean values with a common superscript do not differ
