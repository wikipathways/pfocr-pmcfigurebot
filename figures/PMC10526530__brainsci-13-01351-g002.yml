caption: 'Inflammatory downstream pathways of autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs). The
  inflammasome pathway is activated by various pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs), initiating a cascade that culminates with the activation of pyrin or nucleotide-binding
  domain, leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 (NLRP3) or nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) towards different intracellular sensors, such as
  pattern recognition receptors (PPRs). Mevalonate kinase (MVK) and proline-serine-threonine
  phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) modulate the pyrin pathway. Inflammasome
  receptors lead to caspase 1 activation, which converts pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 into
  their bioactive forms, such as IL-1β and IL-18. Caspase 1 also cleaves gasdermin-D
  (GSDMD), with its N-N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N) forming cytotoxic pores in the cellular
  membrane, resulting in pyroptosis and cytokine release. The canonical nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF-kB) activation pathway is triggered by the interaction between tumor
  necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and the TNF receptor (TNFR), followed by the phosphorylation
  of linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), primarily composed of HOIP, HOIL-1,
  and SHARPIN, which is necessary for efficient activation. A20 and OTULIN modulate
  the pathway by cleaving and activating polyubiquitin. The interferon (IFN) pathway
  is activated by the interaction between IFNα, IFNβ, and the IFNα/β receptor (IFNR),
  leading to the activation of deoxyribonucleases (DNAse), ribonucleases (RNAse),
  three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), melanoma
  differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), and DEAD Box Protein 58 (DDX58), which
  activate stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The latter translocates to the
  nucleus, stimulating the transcription of type I IFN genes. STING also directly
  activates NFkB signaling, resulting in the release of IL-1, TNFα, IFNα, and IFNβ.
