caption: 'Distinct molecular pathways activated by burn injury and formalin application.
  (a) Bubble plot represents the Gene Ontology (GO): Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) pathways activated in spinal cord samples following FA and BI. The
  pathways were selected based on their relevance to nervous tissue and the upregulated
  genes identified in the burn injury or formalin experiments (refer to the heatmap
  images in Figure 6). These upregulated genes and their second-order interacting
  genes (filtered by a log fold change criterion of −0.5 < log2FC > 0.5) form the
  core of our molecular network. This second-order molecular network and the KEGG
  pathway search were conducted using the Cytoscape String app (version 3.10.1, https://string-db.org/).
  The size of each bubble corresponds to the number of genes associated with a given
  pathway. The z-score value indicates the ratio of these genes upregulated in the
  inflammatory pain model (negative values) or in burn injury (positive values). The
  color gradient represents the false discovery rate (FDR) on a log10 scale, providing
  a measure of statistical significance. (b) The initial components of the Wnt signaling
  cascade are involved in burn injury-induced nociception. KEGG Pathview analysis
  of the molecular signature of the Wnt signaling pathway in burn injury vs. control.
  The KEGG pathway analysis shows that burn injury results in the upregulation or
  downregulation of multiple components of the Wnt signaling pathway. Each box is
  one gene. The color (in the log2 scale) represents the log2-based fold change. Gene
  expression levels are indicated as higher (red), unchanged (gray), or lower (green)
  in burn-injured mice compared to non-treated control'
