figure_title: Labeling activity of U-13C glucose along the central carbon metabolic
  pathway intermediates.
caption: 'Labeling activity of U-13C glucose along the central carbon metabolic pathway
  intermediates. (a) Total labeling extent of central carbon metabolism intermediates
  for the different life stages of worms grown on Chryseobacterium sp. CHNTR56 MYb120
  versus E. coli OP50; (b) MID distributions of key central carbon metabolism intermediates
  at the L4 stage of the worms; (c) diagram of the proposed pathway activities in
  part of the central carbon metabolism of worms grown on Chryseobacterium sp. CHNTR56
  MYb120 showing extracted labeling activity. (L4: L4-young adult stage; A1: adult
  day 1 stage; A6: adult day 6 stage; A10: adult day 10 stage; Mn—isotopologue distribution,
  where n is the number of carbon atoms in each metabolite, and n = 1…n)'
