caption: Downstream functional analysis of CD4+ TEM cluster core markers in PTB. (A–D)
  The spatial distribution of marker expression in each cell (A) and T cell subset
  (B–D) is named and visualized. (E) Visualizing the sequential arrangement of highly
  dynamic genes among diverse sets of established proteins and two markers. (F–H)
  Expression of GBP2 (F), TRAV1-2 (G), and ODF2L (H) from (E). (I,J) The number of
  pairings of receptors and ligands is shown by the cell-cell communication network
  between GBP2-positive and -negative CD4+ TEM cells and other T cell subsets. The
  thickness of each line represents the number of pairings. (K) Bubble diagram of
  enriched metabolic pathways referring to the metabolic differences between GBP2-positive
  and -negative CD4+ TEM cells. Each bubble denotes a single metabolic pathway. The
  p-value and total number of metabolites engaged are listed on the right. (L,M) GO
  and KEGG analyses of GBP2-positive and -negative CD4+ TEM cells
