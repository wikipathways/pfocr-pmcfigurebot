figure_title: Network pharmacology and untargeted metabolomics of EVO intervention
  in PTSD associated with KEGG pathways.
caption: 'Network pharmacology and untargeted metabolomics of EVO intervention in
  PTSD associated with KEGG pathways. (A) Venn diagram of network pharmacology and
  off-target metabolomics intersecting KEGG pathways. KEGG pathways 1–24: Dopaminergic
  synapse, cAMP signaling pathway, morphine addiction, parathyroid hormone synthesis,
  secretion and action, taste transduction, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes,
  longevity regulating pathway—multiple species, renin secretion, serotonergic synapse,
  neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction, endocrine resistance, Type II diabetes
  mellitus, GnRH signaling pathway, relaxin signaling pathway, estrogen signaling
  pathway, calcium signaling pathway, phospholipase D signaling pathway, oxytocin
  signaling pathway, cholinergic synapse, sphingolipid signaling pathway, ubiquinone
  and other terpenoid–quinone biosynthesis, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling,
  ovarian steroidogenesis. (B) The renin secretion and renin–angiotensin system pathway
  diagram. (C) Diagram of core target locations in the renin secretion and renin–angiotensin
  system pathways'
