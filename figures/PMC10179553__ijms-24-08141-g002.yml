caption: MYCN is a potential direct regulator of genes involved in differentially
  regulated biological processes. (A) Top 10 gene ontologies enriched with MYCN-bound
  genes. (Left), up-regulated genes. (Right), down-regulated genes. (B) R2 genome
  browser analysis of MYCN ChIP-Seq peaks at TSSs of the RPL5 gene, representative
  of MYCN-bound and up-regulated genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis (Top panel),
  and the APH1A gene, representative of MYCN-bound and down-regulated genes involved
  in NOTCH signaling pathway (Bottom panel). Arrowhead indicates the direction of
  transcription. MYCN ChIP-Seq pileup at the TSSs of genes involved in (C) ribosomal
  biogenesis and (D) NOTCH signaling pathway. (E) Pathway analysis of differentially
  up-regulated (left) and down-regulated (right) genes in IMR32 cell line following
  MYCN knockdown. False discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05 was used as cut-off value to define
  statistical significance
