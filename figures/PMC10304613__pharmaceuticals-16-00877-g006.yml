caption: 'TPK1 promotes Be(2)-M17 and SH-SY5Y cell differentiation. (A) The PCAT database
  showed that ACAT1 was negatively correlated with TPK1. (B) Kaplan–Meier curves of
  overall survival in neuroblastoma patients with different TPK1 expression. p-value
  < 0.05. (C) Immunohistochemistry of tumor tissues by CHA treatment, n = 3. Scale
  bar: 100 μm. (D) Immunohistochemistry of tumor tissues with ACAT1 knockdown, n =
  3. Scale bar, 100 μm. (E) Overexpression of TPK1 in Be(2)-M17 and SH-SY5Y cells,
  n = 3. (F) Knockdown of TPK1 in shACAT1 #2 stably transfected cell lines, n = 3.
  (G) PDH activity in Be(2)-M17 and SH-SY5Y cells with the overexpression of TPK1,
  n = 3. (H) A model diagram of CHA modulation of the ACAT1-TPK1-PDH pathway promotes
  neuroblastoma differentiation. For C, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and
  **** p < 0.0001, compared to the control. For (D–G), * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***
  p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001, compared to the vector'
