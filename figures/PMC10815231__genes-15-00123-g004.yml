caption: Graphical summary of the mechanisms of action of miRNAs and lncRNAs in DKD.
  NcRNAs with beneficial effects are colored in green, while those related to disease
  progression that could serve as therapeutic targets are colored in red. (A) MiR-23a-3p
  has been found to inhibit renal fibrosis by its effect on the TGF-β/Smad-dependent
  signaling pathway. (B) LncMGC and miR-378 have been associated with renal fibrosis,
  and the latter inhibits processes like adaptive mitophagy. (C) MiR-122-5p has been
  shown to lower levels of markers associated with tubular injury, possibly through
  inhibition of FIH-1. (D) ENSG00000254693, along with HuR, can lead to podocyte injury.
  (E) MiR-93-5p inhibits ROCK2, leading to fibrosis, but it is sponged by KCNQ1OT1.
  (F) ESNT00000436340 causes podocyte injury same through inhibition of RAB3B. (G)
  MALAT1 sponges miR-2355-3p, which inhibits the STST3/NF-κB axis, thus reducing fibrosis.
  (H) MALAT1 also leads to oxidative damage through activation of the Nox4/AMPK/mTOR
  signaling pathway
