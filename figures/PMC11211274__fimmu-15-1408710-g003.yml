caption: IL-17 promotes suppression gene signatures in tumor-infiltrating Tregs. (A)
  Volcano plot of statistically significant (log2FC >= 0.25, adjusted p-value < 0.05,
  min.pct >= 0.1) differentially expressed genes in scRNAseq data between Il17raΔTreg
  and control tumor-infiltrating Tregs. (B) Gene Ontology (GO) pathway enrichment
  analysis of genes significantly up or downregulated by Il17ra KO in tumor Tregs.
  (C, D) Gene network plots of a subset of pathways significantly enriched amongst
  the down (C) and upregulated (D) DEGs by IL-17 signaling.
article_title: Interleukin-17 directly stimulates tumor infiltrating Tregs to prevent
  cancer development.
