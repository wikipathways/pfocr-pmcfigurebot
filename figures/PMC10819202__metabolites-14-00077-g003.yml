figure_title: Intra-individual metabolite concentration changes per year at three
  time points over a 6-year period.
caption: Intra-individual metabolite concentration changes per year at three time
  points over a 6-year period. Metabolites classified as having (a) “excellent” or
  (b) “fair to good” reliability for evaluation over time are illustrated. For each
  metabolite, point estimates of annual changes divided by standard deviation and
  their 95% confidence intervals are shown. The metabolic pathway is shown on the
  right side [20,21]. CSSG, cysteine-glutathione disulfide; SAM, S-Adenosylmethionine;
  SD, standard deviation; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle
