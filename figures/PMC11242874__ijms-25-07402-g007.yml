caption: Functional model of the PpGATA21-PpGA2ox7 regulatory module in the dwarfing
  of peach trees mediated by C. humilis. On the left, when grafted onto A. persica
  rootstocks, the GA content in peach trees does not change, leading to increased
  plant height as the dwarfing pathway mediated by the PpGATA21-PpGA2ox7 module is
  not activated. On the right, grafting onto C. humilis rootstocks induces the expression
  of the PpGATA21 gene. The PpGATA21 transcription factor positively regulates the
  expression of PpGA2ox7 by binding to its promoter. The PpGA2ox7 gene acts as a negative
  regulator of GA biosynthesis. Arrows indicate positive regulatory effects between
  components. Solid arrows indicate activation, whereas blunt-ended arrows indicate
  inhibition. The dashed arrow remains to be further experimentally confirmed
