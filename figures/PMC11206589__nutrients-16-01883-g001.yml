figure_title: Scheme showing how ω-3 PUFAs inhibit () cell proliferation by reducing
  () the expression of some growth factors, including human epidermal growth factor
  receptor-2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and insulin-like growth
  factor 1 (IGF-1R), by either activating () peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma (PPARγ) or decreasing levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) protein.
caption: Scheme showing how ω-3 PUFAs inhibit () cell proliferation by reducing ()
  the expression of some growth factors, including human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
  (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and insulin-like growth factor
  1 (IGF-1R), by either activating () peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
  (PPARγ) or decreasing levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) protein. Furthermore,
  PUFAs promote cell apoptosis by blocking phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase
  B (PI3K/Akt) pathways, downregulating phosphorylated Akt, inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB) activity, and lowering B-cell lymphoma 2/B-cell lymphoma 2-like protein
  4 (Bcl-2/Bax ratio). Created with BioRender.com (https://app.biorender.com/illustrations/65fc51a4a6668e33e3bf3d89
