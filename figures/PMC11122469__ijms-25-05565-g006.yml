caption: Combination drug treatment with PIK-75/alpelisib and gefitinib on UWG02CTCs.
  Fa-CI plots simulated by the median-effect equation for two drugs shown using CalcuSyn
  2.11 software. (A,B) UWG02CTC with PIK-75+gefitinib in (A) 2D and (B) ULA conditions.
  (C,D) Treatment with alpesib and gefitinib in (C) 2D and (D) ULA conditions. Representative
  of at least 2 separate experiments each performed in triplicate. CI ≤ 1 synergistic,
  CI = 1 additive, CI ≥ 1 antagonistic. Dotted lines indicate CI = 1. (E–G) Western
  blot analysis of combination treatment on signalling pathway responses to either
  PIK-75 and gefitinib in (E) UWG02CTC or (F) AGS cells, and (G) alpelisib and gefitinib
  in UWG02CTC in 2D culture conditions. Cells were treated for 1 h with PIK-75 and
  gefitinib and for 3 h with alpelisib and gefitinib drug combinations at approximately
  either their IC50 concentrations derived from dose–response curves as single agents
  or their (experimental or calculated) DRI concentrations for Fa = 0.5 derived from
  combination drug experiments under 2D conditions. E) 40 nM PIK-75 + 250 nM gefitinib
  (IC50) or 16 nM PIK-75 + 20 nM gefitinib (DRI) n = 3. (F) 40 nM PIK-75 + 250 µM
  gefitinib (IC50) or 16 nM PIK-75 + 20 µM gefitinib (DRI) n = 3. (G) 6.6 µM alpelisib
  + 270 nM gefitinib (IC50), 3.3 µM alpelisib + 135 nM ½ IC50) or 600 nM alpelisib
  + 41 nM gefitinib (DRI)
