caption: 'CCL8 was induced by lactate in macrophages. (A,B) KEGG pathway and volcano
  map and volcano map analysis of differential genes on lactate-treated macrophages
  for 24 h. (C) qRT-PCR in macrophages stimulated with CM3 or LA for 24 h. (D) ELISA
  detection of CCL8 in the serum of healthy and CRC donors. (E,F) Representative images
  and quantitative analysis of immunohistochemistry for CCL8 and CD68 in CRC tissues
  and adjacent nontumor tissues. All t-tests were two-tailed. Mean ± SEM. ** p < 0.01;
