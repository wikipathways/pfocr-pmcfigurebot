caption: The roles of AT1 and AT2 receptors, the MAP kinases, and NF-κB signaling
  pathways in mediating ECFP/Ang II-induced Na+/HCO3- cotransporter expression in
  wild-type mPCT cells. Panel (A) shows that ECFP/Ang II significantly increased Na+/HCO3-
  expression, and the response was attenuated by losartan but not by PD123319, suggesting
  a dominant role of AT1 receptors in mPCT cells. Panel (B) shows that the MEK1/MEK2
  kinase inhibitor U0126, the NF-κB activation inhibitor Ro 106–9920, and the MEK
  inhibitor PD 980659 attenuated the effects of ECFP/Ang II on expression, but the
  p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB202196 had no effect on Na+/HCO3- expression. ** p <
