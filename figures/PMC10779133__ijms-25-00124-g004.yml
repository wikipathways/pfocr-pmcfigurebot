figure_title: Signaling functions of KBs and KD for anti-neuroinflammation and autophagic
  flux.
caption: Signaling functions of KBs and KD for anti-neuroinflammation and autophagic
  flux. (A) KBs exert anti-inflammatory responses by activating hydroxycarboxylic
  acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), which inhibits nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and NOD-like
  receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes. KBs and KD inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome
  through KATP channels, Drp1, AMPK/FOXO3, and STAT3 pathways, and NF-κB through COX-1/PGD2,
  IRAKM, PPARs, and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. KBs and KD also suppress inflammation through
  Akt/RhoGTPase-mediated ramification via HDAC inhibition and M2 microglial polarization.
  (B) KBs and KD induce autophagy and lysosomal proteins through SIRT1/2, AMPK, ULK1,
  mTORC1, and FOXO1/3a pathways and maintain lysosomal integrity through LAMP2. These
  changes increase autophagic flux, resulting in increased neuroprotection. All arrows
  indicate activation and truncated cut lines indicate inhibition
