figure_title: Outline of the DTSAs biosynthetic pathway in Dendrobium species.
caption: Outline of the DTSAs biosynthetic pathway in Dendrobium species. (A) The
  proposed biosynthetic process of DTSAs. (B) Candidate genes involved in the backbone
  formation and post-modification were obtained from genomic and transcriptomic data
  of D. nobile. (C) The potential backbone structures that form intermediates. The
  orange labels indicate possible intermediates that have been isolated and identified,
  which may participate in this biosynthetic process. The dashed lines represent the
  hypothetical processes. The mauve dashed lines mean putative ways of forming intermediates
  through either oxidation or hydrolysis. The red letters of the functional groups
  are transitory putative modifications, representing the difference between intermediates
  with their potential backbone structures
