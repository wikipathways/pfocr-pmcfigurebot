caption: Apoptosis and p53 signaling pathway in all analyzed groups. Changes in the
  expression profile of genes involved in the pathway are marked in green for statistically
  significant upregulation and red for statistically significant downregulation. The
  beige color indicates the enriched term. The size of the bubble corresponds to the
  number of genes involved in a particular GO term
