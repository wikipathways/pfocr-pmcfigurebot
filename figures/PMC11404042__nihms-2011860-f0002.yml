figure_title: Pre-vaccination profiling of plasma metabolites reveals that metabolic
  pathway activity is associated with inflammatory status
caption: (A) Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) was performed on pre-ranked
  metabolites from differential expression analysis, followed by EnrichmentMap analysis
  with a Jaccard index >0.5 for modules displaying a nominal p < 0.05. Bar plot represents
  individual modules, with the signed â€”log10(p value) as a metric for the association
  with breadth, where red and blue respectively denote an association with high and
  low breadth.(B) Heatmap representing the core metabolites from modules in (A), where
  each row represents normalized metabolite expression and columns represent individual
  participants. Row annotation tracks (left) represent the signed log p value of the
  association of each outcome for each module, with blue and red denoting high negative
  and positive significance, respectively. Column annotation tracks (top) represent
  the outcome per subject. The dataset contains 8 and 23 biological replicates for
  low and high breadth, respectively.(C) Integrated correlation network analysis of
  transcriptomics and metabolomics, where nodes denote features and edges the correlation
  coefficient between the two features they link. Spearman correlation (p < 0.05)
  was used as an integration metric across OMICs and displayed on the edge color.

  breadth.(D) Cartoon depicting the association of breadth correlates for low (left)
  and high (right) breadth
