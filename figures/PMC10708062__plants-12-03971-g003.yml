figure_title: Comprehensive analysis of the DEGs shared in both leaves and roots.
caption: Comprehensive analysis of the DEGs shared in both leaves and roots. (a) The
  number of up-regulated DEGs shared in both leaves and roots after 2 h and 50 h of
  osmotic stress. (b) The number of down-regulated DEGs shared in both leaves and
  roots after 2 h and 50 h of osmotic stress. (c) The enriched KEGG pathways of the
  up-regulated DEGs shared in both leaves and roots after 2 h and 50 h of osmotic
  stress. (d) The enriched KEGG pathways of the down-regulated DEGs shared in both
  leaves and roots after 2 h and 50 h of osmotic stress. The red color digit in venn
  (a) represents the number of up-regulated DEGs share in both leaves and roots, the
  blue color digit in venn (b) represents the number of down-regulated DEGs in both
  leaves and roots. The q-value is represented by red color from light red to dark
  red. The size of the dark dots reflects the number of DEGs involved in each metabolism
  pathway
