figure_title: Schematic diagram of macrophage origins and biological functions.
caption: 'Schematic diagram of macrophage origins and biological functions. (a) Macrophage
  origins: macrophages derived from the bone marrow and yolk sac [36]; (b) Macrophage
  biological functions. (A) Phagocytosis: this function is to recognize and degrade
  pathogens, dead cells, and cell debris under the mediation of complex receptors
  and the activation of the actin-dependent mechanism, including four phases: (1)
  targeting particles detection; (2) internalization process activation; (3) phagosome
  formation; (4) phagosome maturation [53,54]; (B) Antigen presentation: B cells can
  recognize antigens through the variable domain of BCR, while T cells exclusively
  detect a wide range of antigens presented by MHC molecules macrophages through TCRs
  via cross-presentation, including the cytosolic pathway and vacuolar pathway [8,55,56];
  (C) Cytokine production: M1-like macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as IL-1 and TNF-α, whereas M2-like macrophages mainly produce anti-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β [40,57,58]. Abbreviations: A2AR, adenosine A2A
