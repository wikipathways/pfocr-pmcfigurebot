caption: The expression of GRSF1 and UQCRFS1 in CRC is associated with a favourable
  prognosis. (A) KM analysis of UQCRFS1, GRSF1, PTP4A1, and LGALS2 in the Meta-GEO
  cohort. (B) Correlation of UQCRFS1, GRSF1, and LGALS2 with Stage, Lymph Node Metastasis,
  and Distant Metastasis. (C) Based on the TISCH2 database to identify the expression
  patterns of GRSF1 and UQCRFS1 in malignant and non-malignant cells across three
  single-cell datasets for colorectal cancer. (D) Survival analysis for UQCRFS1 and
  GRSF1 in pan-cancer cohort. (E) GRSF1 and UQCRFS1 correlate with five metabolic
  pathways and many malignant features of the tumour in the pan-cancer cohort. (F)
  Association of GRSF1 and UQCRFS2 with the set of immunotherapy-positive related
  signatures
