figure_title: β-cyc modulation of the Ras/Raf signaling pathway in PC12 cells.
caption: 'β-cyc modulation of the Ras/Raf signaling pathway in PC12 cells. (A–E) Effects
  of inhibitors of TrkA, TrkB, Ras, Raf, ERK (K252a, ANA-12, FTA, AZ628, U0126, respectively)
  on the neurite outgrowth induced by β-cyc, its combination with NGF, and NGF 1 ng/mL.
  Each experiment was repeated three times. The data were expressed as a mean ± SEM.
  *** p < 0.001, compared with the negative control; ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001,
  compared with the 3 µM β-cyc group; $$ p < 0.01 and $$$ p < 0.001, compared with
  the combination group of β-cyc with low-dose NGF; & p < 0.05 and && p < 0.01, ns
  means no significant difference'
