figure_title: Optimization of sterol environments for CB1R.
caption: Optimization of sterol environments for CB1R. (a) Comparison of ergosterol
  and cholesterol production pathways in yeast and humans, respectively, after the
  common intermediate zymosterol. (b) Cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates and the
  enzymes that act on them after zymosterol. (c) Fold change in signaling results
  for CB1R in sterol-modified strains. Strains were engineered to produce cholesterol
  and\or cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates, and the sterol content was measured
  using GC-MS in a previously published work reproduced here with permission. Dose
  responses were performed for both receptors in each strain, and fold changes of
  the maximum signal-over-signal with 0 ÂµM agonists were calculated. The agonist ACEA
  was used for CB1R. For all experiments, n = 3. Nonlinear regression was fit as a
  four-parameter logistic equation
