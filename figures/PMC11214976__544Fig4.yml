caption: Salidroside suppresses liver inflammation via the HMGB1 signaling pathway
  after liver transplantation(A) Representative western blots showing HMGB1/TLR-4/MAPK
  signaling pathway-related proteins in the different groups. (B) Quantitative analysis
  of the western blots. The significant differences among groups were compared using
  one-way ANOVA. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.
