figure_title: VAD-induced airway remodeling leads to a breakdown in mucoclliary clearance
caption: (A) Gene expression of secretory (Scgb1al and Scgb3a2) and chary (Foxj1,
  Tubb4a) markers In VAS and VAD mouse lunge (n=14). ** = p < 0.01. “ns” = not significant,
  (B) Proportion of ciliated and secretory cells within the airway of the LRT In 8-week
  VAS and VAD lungs. The y-axis represents the actual proportion of total airway epithelium
  where 1 = 100%. P-values = 0.26 (VAS) and 0.07 (VAD) respectively. ns* = near significance.
  (C-F) Immunohistochemical staining of airway epithelium. Secretory cells were visualized
  using CC10 while ciliated cells were visualzed using both nuclear Foxjl and clla-specific
  Tubb4a. Yellow arrows indicate regions of reduced apical protein expression. White
  arrows Indicate focal hyperplasia. (G) Volcano plot of the top pathways altered
  in VAD lungs, analyzed using the Reactome 2022 database. The Input dataset included
  all differentially expressed genes (DEGO) with p < 0.06 (n=619). (H) Barplot showing
  the top 10 enriched pathways from the Enrichr Reactome database using only genes
  upregulated In VAD lungs with p < 0.05. (I-J) Fluorescent microsphere velocity (I)
  and overall distance traveled (J) In VAS and VAD lungs, p < 0.00001, t-value = 17.70024.
  (K-N) Composite Images of fluorescent microsphere motility In the trachea of VAS
  and VAD lungs from a cross-sectional (K-L) and anterior (M-N) view at 20x magnification.
  All samples represented In this figure were collected at the 8-week timepoint
