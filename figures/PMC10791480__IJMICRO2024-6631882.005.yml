caption: Global transcriptomic profiles change of the lung during H1N1pdm1918 infection.
  (a, d) Heatmap of differentially expressed patterns of genes in the H1N1pdm1918-infected
  lung from two microarray datasets (GSE38112 and GSE70445); (b, e) gene ontology
  analysis showing the biological process of DEGs; (c, f) KEGG pathways of the DEGs.
  Significant top 20 enriched by differentially expressed genes were shown
