figure_title: Role of KYNU-related macrophages in cell-cell communication.
caption: Role of KYNU-related macrophages in cell-cell communication. (a) GC-derived
  cell subpopulations were isolated, and the macrophage subpopulations were reannotated.
  (b) Exploration of cell interactions based on the CellPhoneDB algorithm, with larger
  numbers on the scale indicating stronger interactions. (c) Exploration of cell interactions
  based on the CellChat algorithm, with numbers representing the number of pathways
  involved in cell-cell interactions. (d) Strength and number of incoming and outgoing
  signals among cell subpopulations. Interactions of KYNU(-) and KYNU(+) macrophages
  with other cell subpopulations when acting as (e, f) signal senders and (g, h) signal
  receivers
