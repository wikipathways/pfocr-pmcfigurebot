caption: The Hippo pathway is involved in T cell development. In the thymus, MST1/2
  are more expressed in single-positive (SP) thymocytes than in double-positive (DP)
  thymocytes in the thymus. NDR1/2 regulate the egress of naive T cells from the thymus
  and migration to the periphery. MST1/2 regulates T cell migration by activating
  MOB1A/B, which is required for the activation of the guanyl nucleotide exchanger
  Dock8, and by promoting LFA-1 clustering through direct interaction with the small
  GTPase Rap1-binding effector protein RAPL. MST1/2 also enhances regulatory T (Treg)
  cell differentiation by stabilizing FOXO1/3 or attenuating TCR-stimulated AKT activity.
  TAZ suppresses Treg differentiation by inhibiting FOXP3 via the TAZ-RORγt complex.
  TAZ stimulates Th17 cell differentiation through a complex with RORγt. MST1/2 in
  dendritic cells affect Th17 cells differentiations by inhibiting p38MAPK-MK2/MSK1-CREB
  signaling, which is implicated in IL-6 production
