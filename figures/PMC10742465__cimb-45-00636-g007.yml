caption: A schematic representation of the proposed cardioprotective mechanism of
  hydrogen after CIH exposure. On the one hand, hydrogen attenuated ROS levels through
  the Keap-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. On the other hand, hydrogen could inhibit iron
  overload-induced ROS generation and oxidative damage by adjusting hepcidin-FPN1,
  and HIF-1α-related IRPs’ signaling pathways
