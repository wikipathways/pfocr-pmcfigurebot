figure_title: AjGPER1 activation-mediated intracellular signaling pathway.
caption: 'AjGPER1 activation-mediated intracellular signaling pathway. (A) AjGPER1
  was activated by E2 (100 nM) to stimulate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in HEK293
  cells. (B–D) Activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation mediated by AjGPER1 by E2 was
  reduced or blocked by PKA, PKC, or Gαq protein inhibitors. Serum-starved AjGPER1-expressing
  cells were pretreated with DMSO, PKA inhibitor (H89, 10 μM), PKC inhibitor (Go 6983,
  1 μM), or Gαq protein inhibitor (FR900359, 1 μM) for 1 h before E2 (100 nM) administration.
  (E) Statistical summary of the gray-scale analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitory
  effects by H89, Go 6983, or FR900359 in E2 stimulated AjGPER1-expressing cells.
  Values are presented as means ± SEM. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed
  by Tukey’s multiple comparison tests (** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001).
  (F) Schematic representation of the AjGPER1-mediated cell signaling pathway. E2:
  estradiol; PLC: phospholipase C; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate;
  DAG: diacylglycerol; IP3: inositol triphosphate; IP3R: inositol triphosphate receptor;
  ER: endoplasmic reticulum; Ca2+: calcium ion; PKC: protein kinase C; PKA: protein
  kinase A; ERK1/2: extracellular regulated kinase 1/2; P: phosphorylation. All pictures
  and data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. (See
  Figures S6–S10 for the original Western blot images.)'
