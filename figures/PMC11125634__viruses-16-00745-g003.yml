caption: Schematic representation for DOCK11 and its partner AGAP2 regulating ARF1
  activity to facilitate HBV retrograde trafficking. HBV typically enters cells via
  the canonical retrograde trafficking route, involving initial binding to the NTCP
  receptor, followed by encapsulation of the virus-receptor complex within early endosomes.
  Subsequently, the complex is transported to late endosomes and lysosomes, where
  viral particles are exposed to lysosomal enzymes. Notably, capsid proteins, including
  the viral genome, evade lysosomal degradation and may enter the nucleus [42]. Additionally,
  we have uncovered a non-canonical retrograde trafficking route from early endosomes
  to the trans-Golgi network and endoplasmic reticulum, which facilitates HBV entry
  into the nucleus. Importantly, DOCK11 and its partner AGAP2 are implicated in regulating
  ARF1 activity to facilitate this HBV retrograde trafficking pathway [20]
