figure_title: Peripheral sensory neuron deletion of Mecp2 activates BDNF-TrkB-CREB1
  signaling pathway.
caption: 'Peripheral sensory neuron deletion of Mecp2 activates BDNF-TrkB-CREB1 signaling
  pathway. Protein levels of BDNF, p-CREB1, CREB1, and TrkB in hippocampus (a), spinal
  cord (c), and DRG (e) were determined by western blot. The semi-quantitative protein
  levels of target genes were normalized to Tubulin or GAPDH (b,d,f). Mecp2fl/fl n
  = 6, Mecp2fl/flAdvillincre n = 8. p value was determined by t-test. ns: no significance,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001'
