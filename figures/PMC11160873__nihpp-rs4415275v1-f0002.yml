  neutrophile chemotaxis.
caption: 'PAA degradation pathway is induced in CRAB by exposure to HU and affects
  neutrophile chemotaxis. Differential gene expression of genes in PAA and Phe pathways
  of A. baumannii AB5075 when exposed to HU in transcriptomic analyses (A) and by
  qRT-PCR (B). Differential gene expression of genes in PAA and Phe pathways of A.
  baumannii AMA40 when exposed to HU in transcriptomic analyses (C) and by qRT-PCR
  (D). Neutrophile chemotaxis assays (E) indicate a reduced neutrophile recruitment
  when both CRAB strains are exposed to HU. Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was
  determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparison test. Significance
  was indicated as follows: ***, P <0.001; ** P <0.01, and * P <0.05'
