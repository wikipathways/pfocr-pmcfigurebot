caption: Negative feedback loop of cytosolic ADAR1 isoform acting on type I interferon
  signaling via inactivation of dsRNA. Repetitive elements of the genome produce transcripts
  capable of forming double-stranded RNA structures. In the nucleus, these structures
  undergo ADAR-mediated deamination (1). The cell perceives modified transcripts as
  self, so their appearance in the cytoplasm does not lead to activation of the dsRNA
  reactive pathway (2). If levels of dsRNA in cytoplasm are increased as a result
  of viral attack or overproduction of self dsRNA, e.g., via overexpression of Alu
  repeats, corresponding sensors are activated, such as MDA5 and RIG-1 (3). Activation
  of the sensors triggers antiviral innate immunity through transcription factors
  that initiate type I interferon expression (4). Autocrine and paracrine interferon
  signaling leads to the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes
  via phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 complexes binding specific genomic ISRE elements
  (5). In the ADAR1 gene, interferon signaling switches expression to the p150 isoform,
  which migrates to the cytosol and edits excess dsRNA, thus acting on type I interferon
  signaling as part of a negative feedback loop (6).
