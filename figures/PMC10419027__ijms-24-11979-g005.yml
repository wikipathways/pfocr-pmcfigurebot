caption: |-
  Effects of the TAAR extract on the activation of MAPK signaling pathways in mast cells. (A) The protein expression levels of phosphorylated and total forms of MAPK signaling pathway proteins in anti-DNP IgE/BSA-treated RBL-2H3 cells. (B) Bar graphs displaying the relative intensity ratios of Western blot bands for p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, and p-JNK/JNK. Each value is presented as the mean ± SEM and analyzed by Tukey’s post hoc test from three independent experiments. ###
  p < 0.001 vs. no treatment control group; *** p < 0.001 vs. anti-DNP IgE/BSA treatment only group
