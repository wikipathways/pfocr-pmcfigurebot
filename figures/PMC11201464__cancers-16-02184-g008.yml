caption: KEGG pathways and differentially expressed genes in uLMS cells exposed to
  single or combination agents. (A–C). The top 5 altered pathways are depicted unless
  fewer than 5 pathways met statistical significance as defined by p adj < 0.05, in
  which case only those pathways that were significantly altered are shown for (A)
  SK-UT-1B cells with MK-0752, gemcitabine, and docetaxel; (B) SK-LMS-1 with MK-0752;
  (C) SK-LMS-1 with MK-0752, gemcitabine, and docetaxel relative to DMSO vehicle control.
  (D–F). The top ten up (red) and downregulated (blue) significantly differentially
  expressed genes by log2 fold change after treatment of (D) SK-UT-1B cells with MK-0752,
  gemcitabine, and docetaxel; (E) SK-LMS-1 with MK-0752; (F) SK-LMS-1 with MK-0752,
  gemcitabine, and docetaxel relative to DMSO vehicle control
