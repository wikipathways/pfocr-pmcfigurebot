caption: A Transwell assay showed that the AKT signaling pathways participated in
  the AS101-mediated inhibition of tumor cell migration. 4T1 (A) and CT26 (B) cells
  were transfected with active AKT plasmids. After 16 hours, the 4T1 and CT26 cells
  were placed on the upper layer of a transwell and then treated with AS101 (8 Î¼M).
  After 24 hours, the bottom layer of cells was stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
  (DAPI) and counted under a fluorescence microscope in (C) 4T1 cells and (D) CT26
  cells
