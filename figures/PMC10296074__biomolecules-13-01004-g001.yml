figure_title: Multiple pathways coordinate and regulate aldosterone signalling.
caption: Multiple pathways coordinate and regulate aldosterone signalling. Multiple
  stimuli result in aldosterone production within the adrenal glands, the role of
  localized aldosterone production remains unknown. Circulating aldosterone my act
  on cell surface MR receptors and GPER in addition to the cytosolic MR receptor.
  The ‘classical’ aldosterone signalling pathway (via cytosolic MR) is protected from
  cortisol activation by hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 activity. These complex pathways
  all represent potential future therapeutic targets
