caption: 'Discussion of inflammation-related and apoptosis pathway analysis results.
  The pathway terms selected to contrast MXD and WO in the KEGG pathway analysis classified
  as inflammation were mmu046657: IL-17 signaling pathway, mmu04668: TNF signaling
  pathway, mmu04210: apoptotic, and mmu04148: epherocytosis. WO, whale oil; MXD, minoxidil'
