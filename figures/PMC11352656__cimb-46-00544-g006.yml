figure_title: Effects of heat stress and astaxanthin treatment in the PPARα signaling
  pathway in the thymus tissue of Cobb 500 broilers.
caption: 'Effects of heat stress and astaxanthin treatment in the PPARα signaling
  pathway in the thymus tissue of Cobb 500 broilers. Three groups were compared: TN,
  HS, and HSAX. Dunn post hoc test for pair-wise comparison of statistical significance
  represented the following: (A) RXRA, TN vs. HS (p = 0.003); (B) PPARγ, TN vs. HS
  (p = 0.011), TN vs. HSAX (p = 0.011); (C) CD36, TN vs. HS (p = 0.045). * Differences
  between treatments significant at p < 0.05; ** differences between treatments significant
  at p < 0.01'
