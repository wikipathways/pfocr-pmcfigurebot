caption: Suppression of STAT1/NFκB/ERK signaling pathway by CVC treatment in murine
  liver and macrophages. (A)Ccr2+/+ or Ccr2-/- mice were injected with 2 doses of
  CCl4 or olive oil. Protein levels of STAT1, p-STAT1, NFκB, p-NFκB, ERK, and p-ERK
  were analyzed by WB. N=6/group. (B) Raw264.7 murine macrophages were treated with
  DSMO, CVC, the STAT1 inhibitor nifuroxazide, the NFκB inhibitor celastrol, and the
  MEK inhibitor AZD6244 for 2 hours followed by stimulation with LPS for another 6
  hours. WB was applied to determine the protein levels of STAT1, p-STAT1, NFκB, p-NFκB,
  ERK, and p-ERK (B). n=3/group. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001, ns,
