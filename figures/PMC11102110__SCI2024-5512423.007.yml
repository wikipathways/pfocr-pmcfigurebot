caption: Model of exosomal miR-423-5p derived from CSFP-induced OBs in promoting angiogenesis
  of ECs. CSFP induces the secretion of OBs-derived exosomal miR-423-5p. OBs-derived
  exosomal miR-423-5p can directly target DUSP8 and then regulate the ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway to promote the angiogenesis of ECs
