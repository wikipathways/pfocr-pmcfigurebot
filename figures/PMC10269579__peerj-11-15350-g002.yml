figure_title: Gene set enrichment analysis of SiSPTNBC Groups 1â€“4
caption: The left panel showed the top 10 hallmarks of each SiSPTNBC subgroup ranked
  by p-values. The size of the circle is proportional to the number of genes in each
  pathway. The right panel showed levels of p-values ascendingly reordered. Three
  thresholds indicated p-values at 0.1, 0.05 and 0.001.
