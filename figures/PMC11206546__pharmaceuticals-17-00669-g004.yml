figure_title: Protein expression of kinases of the mTOR signaling pathway.
caption: Protein expression of kinases of the mTOR signaling pathway. Levels of Erk1
  (A), Erk2 (B), Akt (C) and mTOR (D) were detected in the synaptoneurosomal fractions
  derived from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of ketamine- and vehicle-treated
  adolescent mice. All proteins are represented as the ratio of their phosphorylated
  forms to their total forms. Graph values within each tissue are presented as a %
  of respective controls. Data are presented as means ± SEM and were analyzed using
  independent samples t-test within each tissue. Statistically significant differences
  are given as p < 0.05. * Vehicle (Veh) vs. ketamine (Ket). HPC, hippocampus; PFC,
  prefrontal cortex
