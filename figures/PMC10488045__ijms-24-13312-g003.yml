caption: '(A,B) WB was used to detect the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  after overexpression or knockdown of THBS1 in two OSCC cell lines. (C,D) Quantitative
  analysis of p-AKT protein expression levels in OSCC cells (n = 3, one-way ANOVA
  followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons; vector vs. THBS1 and NC vs. si-THBS1,
  * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001). (E,F) Immunofluorescence was used to
  detect the expression and nuclear translocation of p-AKT in OSCC cells after overexpression
  or knockdown of THBS1 or treatment with 10 nM LY294002 inhibitor (scale bar, 50
  μm). (G,H) Quantitative analysis of p-AKT nuclear expression in two OSCC cells (n
  = 3, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons; vector vs. THBS1 and
  NC vs. si-THBS1, * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001), ns: no significant'
