caption: Glucose metabolic crosstalk between breast cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment.
  Glucose metabolic crosstalk between breast cancer (BC) cells and tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs), tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs), or cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs) is mediated by glucose metabolites such as lactate and pyruvate. Lactate
  can contribute to the transition of macrophages from M1-like to M2-like, while acting
  as a double-edged sword in modulating T cells. CAFs undergo a reverse Warburg effect,
  producing lactate and pyruvate which are taken up by breast cancer cells to promote
  their proliferation. The upward arrow indicates increased activity in the specific
  metabolic pathwayâ€“glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
