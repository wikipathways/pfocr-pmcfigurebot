caption: Obesity associated with differential circulating serum metabolome. The Biocrates
  MxP Quant500 metabolomics assay was utilized to assess the metabolome of GI patient
  serum samples of normal weight (purple, n = 4) and overweight (blue, n = 2) patients.
  (A) Principal component analysis reveals distinction between normal weight (purple)
  and overweight (blue) serum samples, based on the abundance of 630 metabolites measured
  by metabolomics study. (B) Volcano plot shows significantly differential metabolite
  abundances (p < 0.1, |logFC| > 1.5) between the normal BMI and overweight BMI patient
  groups. (C) Boxplots quantify the top 10 significantly differentially abundant metabolites,
  all of which are lipids from 4 different biochemical classes. (D) Corresponding
  with the top 10 differentially abundant metabolites, the metabolite set enrichment
  of all significantly differentially abundant metabolites highlighted alterations
  to lipid and amino acid pathways. This enrichment, specifically, indicated decreased
  lipids, tryptophan metabolites and bile acid metabolites in the obese patients,
  as compared to the non-obese patients (purple), and phosphatidylcholines were increased
  in obese patients, as compared to normal weight patient serum samples
