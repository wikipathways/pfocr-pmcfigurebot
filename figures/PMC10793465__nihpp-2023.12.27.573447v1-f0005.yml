figure_title: The inhibition of nucleotide de novo synthesis is not driven by changes
  in the folate pathway, redox state, or aspartate level
caption: a) Summary of nucleotide metabolism rewiring in macrophages upon stimulation.
  Changes in metabolite levels over time are presented by color code as heatmap bars
  compared to unstimulated cells. All the significant changes in transcript level
  24h after acute stimulation revealed by transcriptomics are presented as color codes
  of the gene name. Blocks of reaction activity are indicated by blue arrows with
  an X and increases of reaction activity are indicated by red arrows.b–c) Labeled
  fraction of (b) AICAR and (c) IMP in unstimulated or stimulated (continually with
  LPS+IFNγ for 48h) BMDMs supplemented with 1mM 13C-formate for 24h before analysis.d–e)
  Labeled fraction of (d) IMP and (e) dTTP in RAW 264.7 cells that are unstimulated,
  stimulated (continually with LPS+IFNγ for 48h), or unstimulated and treated with
  200nM methotrexate (MTX), labeled with γ−15N-glutamine for 24h. Cells were additionally
  supplemented with or without 1 μM folinate throughout the timecourse as indicated.f)
  Relative intracellular dTTP abundance in RAW 264.7 cells that are unstimulated,
  stimulated (continually with LPS+IFNγ for 48h), or unstimulated and treated with
  200nM methotrexate (MTX), with or without supplementation of 1 μM folinate throughout
  the timecourse as indicated. Data are presented relative to abundance in unstimulated,
  un-supplemented cells.g) Intracellular NAD to NADH ratio in unstimulated or stimulated
  (continually with LPS+IFNγ for 48h) BMDMs with or without supplementation of 2.5mM
  pyruvate.h) Relative intracellular abundance of aspartate in BMDMs over a timecourse
  of continual LPS+IFNγ stimulation. Data are presented relative to the abundance
  in unstimulated cells (0h).i) Relative intracellular abundance of aspartate in unstimulated
  or stimulated (continually with LPS+IFNγ for 48h) BMDMs, with or without supplementation
  of 2.5mM pyruvate or 5mM aspartate throughout the timecourse. Data are presented
  relative to abundance in unstimulated, un-supplemented cells.j–l) Fraction of (j)
  M+2 labeled IMP, (k) M+1 and M+3 labeled GMP, and (l) M+1 and M+2 labeled CDP, after
  24h γ−15N-glutamine labeling in unstimulated or stimulated (continually with LPS+IFNγ
  for 48h) BMDMs, with or without the supplementation of 2.5mM pyruvate or 5mM aspartate
  throughout the timecourse. N.d. indicates not detected in this condition.b–l) Bar
  graph with error bar represents mean ± SD (n=3 independent samples).b–c) Statistical
  analysis was performed with unpaired student’s t test comparing unstimulated to
  stimulated conditions. h) Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA
  followed by post hoc Dunnett’s test comparing all groups to unstimulated condition
  (0h). * indicates p<0.05; ** indicates p<0.01; *** indicates p<0.001; ns indicates
  not significant. d–g, i–l) Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA
  followed by post hoc Tukey’s test. Bars with different lower-case letters (a, b,
  c, d, or e) indicate a statistically significant difference with p<0.05
