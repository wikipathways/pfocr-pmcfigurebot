caption: Transcriptome profiling of Ppm1b-deficient hematopoietic stem cells reveals
  altered stem cell properties. (A) KEGG pathway analysis indicating altered signaling
  pathways including Wnt signaling between Ppm1bCKO and Ppm1bfl/fl LSK cells (P<0.05).
  Numbers shown in each bar indicate the number of enriched proteins in relative terms.
  (B) A uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot of 7,364 Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+
  (LSK) cells (3,651 for pm1bfl/fl, 3,713 for Ppm1bCKO) categorized into 5 clusters
  based on distinct differentiation potentials. (C) UMAP plots illustrating principal
  identifiers (expression of marker genes) of various LSK sub-populations. (D) Volcano
  plot showing differential expressed genes (DEG) between Ppm1bCKO and Ppm1bfl/fl
  within each cluster (P.adjust<0.01). (E). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of down-regulated
  DEG between Ppm1bCKO and Ppm1bfl/fl in the non-primed cluster (P<0.05). See also
  Online Supplementary Figures S5 and S6.
