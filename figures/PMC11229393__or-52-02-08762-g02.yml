caption: NF-κB/ST6GAL1 pathway plays a crucial role in the impact of DT on inhibiting
  the progression of ICC cells. (A) Enrichment analysis of GO terms. (B) Enrichment
  analysis of KEGG pathways. (C) Gene expression profiling alterations after DT treatment.
  (D) Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression levels
  of ST6GAL1 in ICC cells treated with DT. (E) Western blotting was employed to assess
  the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, NF-κB and ST6GAL1 following
  DT treatment. (F and G) In situ lectin fluorescence was used to detect the levels
  of α2,6-sialylation. Data are presented as the mean ± SD, representing the results
  of three independent experiments. **P<0.01 and ****P<0.0001. ST6GAL1, ST6 β-galactoside
