caption: 'Schematic Diagram of Metabolic Pathways of Flavonoids. Transcriptome data
  were utilized to analyze the expression levels of structural genes. Different colored
  boxes indicate changes in gene expression levels. The enzymes are abbreviated as
  follows: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:
  coenzyme A ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; IFS, isoflavone
  synthase; FNS, flavone synthase; F3H, flavanone-3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5 ′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanin synthase; ANR, anthocyanidin
  reductase; BZ1, bronze 1. Asterisks denote statistically significant differences
