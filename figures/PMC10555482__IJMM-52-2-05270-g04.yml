caption: The expression of F2/Rho, HMGB1/RAGE/p38MAPK/NF-κB signal pathway-related
  proteins increases in the lung tissues of rats simulated high-altitude hypoxia.
  (A) Western blot analysis was performed to examined the protein expression levels
  of F2, ROCK1, RhoA, HMGB1, RAGE, p38 MAPK and (NF-κB) p65 in the rat lung tissue.
  (B) Relative protein expression was normalized to that of the respective control,
  β-actin. (C-E) Immunohistochemistry of RAGE and HMGB1 in lung tissues of rats. The
  staining results of the images revealed that the expression of RAGE and HMGB1 in
  the lung tissues of rats exposed to hypoxia was significantly increased compared
  with that of the control rats. The left and right dark and bright images in each
  group is the comparison of the results before and after molecular staining. The
  positive results in the bright pictures refer to the immunostaining of HMGB1 and
  RAGE. *P<0.05 vs. the control group. F2, prothrombin; RAGE, receptor for advanced
  glycation end products; HMGB1, high mobility group protein-1; C, control; H, hypoxia
