figure_title: Single-cell transcriptomes of the extraembryonic endoderm lineages in
  E4.5 embryo
caption: (A) A schematic highlighting embryonic stages from E3.5 and E5.5, depicting
  the lineage relationships of cell states with a primary emphasis on PrE lineage
  segregation events from E4.5 to E5.5. (B) Left panel displays a UMAP embedding of
  the integrated scRNA-seq data of the E4.5 embryo from Nowotschin et al. (Nowotschin
  et al., 2019) and Qiu et al. (Qiu et al., 2022) Epiblast, trophoblast, and extraembryonic
  endoderm subpopulations were color coded. Lineage differentiation paths between
  E3.5 and E4.5 were displayed in a tree plot. Right panel displays a force-directed
  graph showing the trajectory of E4.5 and E5.5 single cells. (C) Violin plots displaying
  the transcriptional signature (calculated by UCell) of cell states for E4.5 parietal
  endoderm module and E4.5 visceral endoderm module identified by hdWGCNA (top 50
  genes). n.s. denotes non-significant, **** denotes p<0.0001 (Wilcoxon Test). (D
  and E) Networks connecting the E4.5 parietal endoderm module genes (D) and E4.5
  visceral endoderm module genes (E) with enriched KEGG pathways. Individual genes
  were color coded according to their membership score (kME) relative to the respective
  gene modules
