caption: EU modifies gene expression profiles and reverses ECM–receptor interaction
  and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction in the skin of chronic UVB-exposed mice.
  (A) PCA of the skin transcriptome. (B) Numbers of DEGs in the control, UVB, and
  EU+UVB groups. (C) Volcano plot of the DEGs in the UVB group mice compared with
  the control group mice. (D) Volcano plot of the DEGs in the EU+UVB group mice compared
  with the UVB group mice. (E) Venn analysis showed that 418 genes were overlapped
  based on the DEGs that are regulated in UVB vs. control and EU vs. UVB. (F) The
  heatmap of 418 overlapped DEGs. (G) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs between the
  UVB and control groups (p adjust < 0.05). (H) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs between
  the EU and UVB groups (p adjust < 0.05). (I) Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction
  enriched by GESA analysis in the UVB group compared to the control group. (J) ECM–receptor
  interaction enriched by GESA analysis in the UVB group compared to the control group.
  (K) Cell adhesion molecules enriched by GESA analysis in the UVB group compared
  to the control group. (L) Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids enriched by GESA
  analysis in the EU+UVB group compared to the UVB group. (M) Cytokine–cytokine receptor
  interaction enriched by GESA analysis in the EU+UVB group compared to the UVB group.
  (N) Retinol metabolism enriched by GESA analysis in the EU+UVB group compared to
  the UVB group. (O) ECM–receptor interaction enriched by GESA analysis in the EU+UVB
  group compared to the UVB group. (P) PPAR signaling pathway enriched by GESA analysis
  in the EU+UVB group compared to the UVB group. NES, normalized enrichment score.
