caption: 'Constructing and validating overall-survival-associated programmed-cell-death
  signature—PAGscore. (A) Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified 75 programmed-cell-death-related
  genes constructing the best-predicting model for overall survival in the training
  cohort; (B) Enriched analysis of KEGG pathways of 75 programmed-cell-death-related
  genes. (C) The ROC analysis showed that PAGscore could effectively predict the 12-,
  24-, and 36-month overall survival rate for patients in the training cohort; (D)
  The survival analysis showed that the overall survival of high-risk patients with
  higher PAGscore was worse than that of low-risk patients with a lower PAGscore in
  the training cohort; (E) The results of ROC and survival analyses showed that PAGscore
  performed well in predicting the overall survival in several types of cancer patients.
