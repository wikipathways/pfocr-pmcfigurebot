caption: The gene expression analysis of the ORCA2, ORCA3, and CR1 enzymes playing
  a role in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway via RT-qPCR. The column diagram shows
  the relative expression determined via qRT-PCR and ubiquitin as an endogenous control
  via LightCycler® 96 Software (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Data are presented as
  the mean ± SD (n = 3). Statistical analysis was performed, via one-way ANOVA, only
  between the plants showing an infection phenotype. Multiple comparison tests were
  conducted using Tukey’s test and are marked using a compact letter display (CLD).
  The samples labeled with the same letter were not significantly different from each
