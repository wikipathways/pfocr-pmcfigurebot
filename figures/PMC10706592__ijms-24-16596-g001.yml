caption: Schematic representation of the TRAIL signaling pathway. Depending on the
  cell type, TRAIL can induce apoptosis by activating the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway.
  Binding to DR4 and/or DR5 induces trimerization of the receptor, a prerequisite
  for the assembly of DISC. The Fas-associated death domain (FADD) adapter protein
  is recruited to the death domain of the TRAIL receptor through its own death domain,
  and FADD recruits pro-caspase-8 to the DISC through interaction with the death effector
  domain (DED), triggering proteolytic activation of caspase-8. Upon the release of
  DISC, active caspase-8 homodimers activate the effector caspase-3 to induce apoptosis.
  The activated caspase-8 activates the pro-apoptotic protein BID by proteolytic removal.
  Once activated (tBID), and with the participation of BAX and/or BAK, this protein
  induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and the subsequent
  release of cytochrome C, which forms an apoptosome with Apaf-1 and caspase-9, activating
  effector caspase-3. c-FLIP binds to caspase-8 and prevents its activation. Members
  of the IAP family (e.g., XIAP, survivin, IAP 1/2) negatively regulate caspase activation
  and can be inactivated by SMAC. Created with BioRender.com
