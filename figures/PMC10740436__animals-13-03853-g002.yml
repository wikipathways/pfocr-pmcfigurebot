caption: 'Boxplot of protein expression significantly different between AT (red),
  BF (green), and CTRL (blue) of alpha-1-B glycoprotein (A), solute carrier family
  5 member 5 (B), tyrosine-protein kinase (C), FRAT regulator of WNT signaling pathway
  1 (D) and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (E). The distribution of differences
  is shown as a box plot. y-axis: intensity of mass spectrum; x-axis: the different
