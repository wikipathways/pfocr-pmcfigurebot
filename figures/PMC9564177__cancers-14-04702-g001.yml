caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of NRF2 activation: NRF2 degradation is accelerated
  through ubiquitination of NRF2 by the KEAP1-CUL3 complex and βTrCP-CUL1 complex.
  Under unstressed conditions, the KEAP1 homodimer binds NRF2 at two sites within
  the Neh2 domain, i.e., the DLG and ETGE motifs, and NRF2 is ubiquitinated efficiently.
  Because NRF2 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome system, the NRF2 protein is maintained
  at a very low level in unstressed conditions. Upon exposure to oxidative or electrophilic
  stresses, specific reactive cysteine residues within KEAP1 are modified. This modification
  attenuates the ubiquitin ligase activity of KEAP1. Thus, NRF2 is stabilized, translocates
  into the nucleus, and activates a set of cytoprotective genes. On the other hand,
  the βTrCP-CUL1 complex also ubiquitinates NRF2. To be recognized by βTrCP, NRF2
  is phosphorylated by GSK3β at two specific serine residues in the Neh6 domain. Phosphorylated
  NRF2 is ubiquitinated by the βTrCP-CUL1 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and degraded
  through the proteasome system. A cascade of signal transduction has been clarified
  in which GSK3β is inhibited/phosphorylated by the activated PI3K-AKT pathway, which
  is under the negative regulation of PTEN. CsMBE, CNC-sMAF binding element.'
