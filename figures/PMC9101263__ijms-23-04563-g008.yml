caption: Schematic presentation of the MBG and HS effects on profibrotic signaling
  in Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (a) and Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats (b). HS diet
  had a similar effect on cardiovascular fibrosis in SD and DSS rats with an activation
  of TGFβ signaling, whereas MBG administration had a different effect on the genes
  participating in profibrotic pathways. In SD rats, MBG activated both Fli-1 and
  TGFβ dependent pathways, whereas in DSS rats, MBG activated only Fli1-dependent
  profibrotic signaling. In addition, MBG downregulated expression of APOE and APP
  genes in DSS rats. HS, high salt; MBG, marinobufagenin; NKA, Na/K-ATPase; Fli-1,
  Freund leukemia integration 1 transcription factor; TGFβ, transforming growth factor
  beta; APOE, apoliporpotein E; APP, amyloid precursor protein; a, the factor which
  participates in the activation of TGFβ pathway by an HS diet; x, the factor, which
  participates in APOE pathway downstream of MBG; y, the factor which participates
  in APP pathway downstream of MBG; z, the factor which participates in Fli-1 pathway
  activation and possibly blocks TGFβ pathway. The hypothetical factors a, x, y and
  z require additional investigation; factor a may be present in both SD and DSS rats,
  and it is regulated by HS intake; factors x, y and z may be activated by MBG in
  DS rats.
