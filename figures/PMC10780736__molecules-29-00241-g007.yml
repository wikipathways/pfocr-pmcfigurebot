  mice.
caption: |-
  APS inhibits the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in colitis mice. (A) Expression of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT and PTEN in colonic tissue was analyzed with Western blotting, and GAPDH was used as a reference for the whole protein. (B–F) Quantitative evaluation of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT and PTEN using Image J to determine spectral band strength. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3). Significantly different compared to the Ctrl group (* p < 0.05). Significantly different compared to the DSS group (#
  p < 0.05, ##
  p < 0.01)
