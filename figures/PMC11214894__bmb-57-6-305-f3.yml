caption: 'The promotion of EMT through PLST-induced Slug expression in H460 and H1299
  cells. (A) qRT-PCR was performed to measure the mRNA levels of Snail, Slug, Twist,
  vimentin and E-cadherin by PLST overexpression in H460 and H1299 cells. (B) qRT-PCR
  was performed to measure the mRNA levels of Snail, Slug, Twist, vimentin and E-cadherin
  by PLST knockdown in H460 and H1299 cells. (C) Luciferase assay was performed to
  measure the change of Slug promoter activity (firefly/renilla) by PLST overexpression
  or knockdown. (D) Western blotting analysis was performed to confirm the protein
  expression level changes of Slug, E-cadherin and vimentin by PLST overexpression
  in H460 and H1299 cells. (E) Western blotting analysis was performed to confirm
  the protein expression level changes of Slug, vimentin and E-cadherin by PLST knockdown
  in H460 and H1299 cells. (F) Immunofluorescence analysis was performed to examine
  the protein expression of Slug in cellular level by PLST overexpression in H460
  and H1299 cells. Scale bar: 50 μm. (G) Immunofluorescence analysis was performed
  to examine the protein expression of Slug in cellular level by PLST knockdown in
  H460 and H1299 cells. Scale bar: 50 μm. These results are the average of three independent
  experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SD (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).'
