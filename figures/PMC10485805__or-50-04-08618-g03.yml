caption: Intestinal flora, disease, tumor microenvironment, influence mechanism and
  application. Dysbiosis of intestinal flora can affect the tumor microenvironment
  through various pathways such as the intestinal-liver and intestinal-brain axes,
  which can cause various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, liver cancer, lung
  cancer and Parkinson's disease. The mechanisms by which the intestinal flora regulates
  the tumor microenvironment mainly involve metabolites, non-hematopoietic components
  of the intestinal membrane, genotoxins, metabolic reprogramming, immune reprogramming
  and regulation of signaling pathways. Study of the association between intestinal
  flora, disease and tumor microenvironment revealed that probiotics, fecal transplants
  and natural extracts could be used to modify the intestinal flora to treat diseases,
  while the related regulatory mediators could be applied as biological targets for
  disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis
