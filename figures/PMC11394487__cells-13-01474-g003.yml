  in Tumorigenesis and Their Potential as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer
caption: Integration of energy metabolism includes multiple events and pathways such
  as glucagon signaling in metabolic pathways, PKA-mediated phosphorylation, insulin
  stimulating increased expression of xylulose-5-phosphate (Xy-5-P), the AMP kinase
  (AMPK)-mediated response to elevated AMP, dephosphorylation of key metabolic factors
  by PP2A, and the transcriptional activation of metabolic genes by ChREBP
