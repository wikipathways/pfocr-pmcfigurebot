figure_title: Hepatic transcriptome from mice fed a NASH diet for 10 weeks
caption: Effect of feeding male mice either a control diet (10% kcal from fat) or
  NASH diet (40% kcal from fat, 20% kcal fructose, and 2% cholesterol) for 10 weeks
  on hepatic gene expression. Heat map of the top 40 differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs; A). Pathways related to immune response, including TREM1 Signaling, Th1 Pathway,
  and Neuroinflammation Signaling Pathway, are activated in the liver of animals fed
  a Western-style diet for 10 weeks compared to a control diet (B). Orange bars denote
  activated pathways (positive z-score > 2), whereas blue bars denote inhibited pathways
  (negative z-score <âˆ’ 2.0). Putative upstream regulators of the DEGs at this time
  point include immune-related molecules such as interferon gamma, interleukin 2,
  interleukin 4, and tumor necrosis factor (C). In the liver of mice fed a NASH diet,
  the gene set for adaptive immune response is significantly enriched (D). Genes related
  to the adaptive immune response, including Ccl2, Ccr2, Icam1, Tlr4, Tnf, and Vcam1
  are significantly upregulated in the liver of mice fed the NASH diet for 10 weeks,
  compared to the control diet (E). Statistical significance was determined by t-test,
  with p < 0.05 considered significant. * p < 0.05, ** p <0.01
