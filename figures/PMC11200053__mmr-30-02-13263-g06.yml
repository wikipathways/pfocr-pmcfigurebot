figure_title: MiR-17-5p overexpression blocks the activation of the TGFβR2/TGF-β/Smad3
  signaling pathway.
caption: 'MiR-17-5p overexpression blocks the activation of the TGFβR2/TGF-β/Smad3
  signaling pathway. AgomiR-17-5p was injected into mice via the tail vein 24 h before
  lipopolysaccharide stimulation. After 24 h post-injury, the kidney tissues were
  collected for subsequent experiments. (A) The expression levels of miR-17-5p were
  determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. (B) The protein expression
  levels of TGFβR2 were detected by western blotting. (C) The protein expression levels
  of TGFβR2, p-Smad2, and p-Smad3 were measured by western blotting. (D) Grayscale
  analysis of TGFβR2, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 using ImageJ software. (E and F) Representative
  immunohistochemical images of TGFβR2 and p-Smad3 in kidney tissues. *P<0.05 and
  **P<0.01 vs. the Sham group; ##P<0.01 vs. AKI group. miR, microRNA; TGFβR2, transforming
  growth factor β receptor 2; p-, phosphorylated; NC, negative control'
