  pathways in Hofbauer cells.
caption: Leptin-mediated activation of STAT3, STAT5, NF-κB p65, and ERK1/2 signaling
  pathways in Hofbauer cells. Representative immunoblotting of Hofbauer cells treated
  with either control (C) or r-leptin (10, 100, 100 ng/mL) displays phosphorylated
  (ph) and total (t) levels of (A) STAT5; (B) STAT3; (C) p65 NF-κB; and (D) ERK1/2
  MAPK, as well as β-actin. Graphs display immunoblot densitometry readings obtained
  from experimental incubations of cells for phosphorylated/total forms of each protein
  after being normalized to β-actin. Bars represent mean ± SEM, n = 3, * p < 0.05,
  ** p = 0.01 or *** p = 0.001 vs. vehicle-treated control (C) analyzed by t-test
