figure_title: NETs activate integrin pathways in CRC cells.
caption: 'NETs activate integrin pathways in CRC cells. (A) Schematic of the experimental
  design and quantitative proteomics workflow. CRC cell lines, HCT116, SW620, and
  LoVo, were incubated with NETs for 48 h. (B) The intersection of significantly changed
  proteins in HCT116, SW620, and LoVo cells (Left). The interaction of significantly
  changed proteins: the color of the lines represents the degree of interaction (Right).
  (C) Western blotting analysis of integrin α5β1 signaling pathway proteins in HCT116
  cells with NETs’ incubation. Tumor cell integrin signaling pathways are activated
  following incubation with NETs, which is attenuated after ITGB knockdown. (D) Western
  blotting analysis of integrin α5β1 signaling pathway proteins in HCT116 cells under
  different conditions. Tumor cell integrin signaling pathways are activated following
  incubation with NETs, which is attenuated after addition of the integrin α5β1 inhibitor
  ATN-161(Ac-PHSCN-NH2). (E) Representative immunofluorescence images of NETs-tumor
  cell interactions. Scale bar, 10 μm. (F) Representative immunofluorescence images
  of NETs-captured tumor cells after knockdown of ITGA5 or ITGB1. Scale bar, 100 μm.
  (G) Quantitation of CRC cells captured by NETs in vitro. CRC cell number was calculated
  using ImageJ (version 1.53r) (n = 8 per group; mean ± SEM, Student’s t-test). ****
