  of modules associated with PTC.
caption: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and identification of
  modules associated with PTC. A-B. Determination of the optimal soft-thresholding
  power for scale-free network construction, demonstrated by achieving a scale-free
  fit index of 0.9. C-D. Visualization of module merging based on eigengene connectivity,
  with a threshold set at 0.75 to identify modules most relevant to PTC traits. E.
  Dendrogram and module-trait heatmap illustrating eleven distinct modules identified,
  with module membership (MM) and gene significance (GS) quantifying the correlation
  between gene expression and module eigengenes (MEs), as well as the link between
  samples and module genes, respectively. F. A focused view on the grey module's strong
  association with PTC, underscoring its potential in revealing key pathways or gene
  sets for PTC research
