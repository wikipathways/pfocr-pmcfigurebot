figure_title: Constructing receptor-coupled push-pull sensor circuits
caption: (A) Push-pull sensor circuit design. Reversible ligand binding to extracellular
  receptors triggers push-pull activation (left). The circuit is encoded as 4 genes
  on 3 plasmids; it includes two receptor chains (FRB*-TM-kinase domain and FKBP-TM-LZ),
  a synSub with 3 motif repeats, and a synPhos. Dimerization of extracellular FRB*
  and FKBP domains induced by ligand (AP21967) triggers colocalization of receptor-appended
  kinase with synSub (cyan box), leading to phosphorylation (right). (B) Testing receptor-induced
  phosphorylation. HHH plots depict flow-cytometry data from sensor circuit compositions
  analyzed 12 h after treatment with 200 nM ligand (+ lig) or a carrier-only control
  (− lig). Values in each plot indicate mean phosphorylation (AU) ± SEM (n=3). Phosphorylation
  fold-change values are next to each set of plots. (C) Measuring pathway activation
  using an LLP condensate co-localization reporter. The reporter consists of EGFP-tagged
  synSub and an mCherry-tagged SH2 domain tagged with an intrinsically disordered
  protein (IDP); phosphorylation leads synSub-EGFP recruitment to condensates and
  EGFP/mCherry colocalization (left). For activation experiments, cells were cultured
  for 24 h and then time-lapse images were taken every 10 mins following ligand addition
  over an 80 min time course to track pathway activation (left time course plot).
  For deactivation experiments 200 nM ligand was added for 90 mins followed by addition
  of the inhibitor imatinib mesylate (10 μM), and then time-lapse images were taken
  every 5 mins following inhibitor addition over a 60 min time course (right time
  course plot). Data are plotted as single cell trajectories (thin pink lines) for
  activation (n=15 cells) and deactivation (n=10 cells), with mean values (thick pink
  line) ± SEM (shaded pink bands). For selected time points (0, 30, and 70 min for
  activation and 0 and 30 min for deactivation), images of EGFP and mCherry (false-colored
  green and red, right middle) are shown for representative single cells, with the
  cell boundaries (dotted white outlines) as determined by custom segmentation software.
  Histograms (right top) show max-normalized EGFP and mCherry intensities along the
  straight white dashed lines drawn in images, and intensity is plotted for each channel
  in the same plot, with the black dashed line representing max-normalized cytoplasmic
  EGFP intensity; shaded regions, outside the cytoplasm. Scale bars, 5 μm
