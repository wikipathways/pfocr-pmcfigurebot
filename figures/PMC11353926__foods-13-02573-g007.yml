figure_title: Glycerol phospholipid metabolic pathway and major metabolites.
caption: Glycerol phospholipid metabolic pathway and major metabolites. (A) Glycerol
  phospholipid metabolic pathway; (B) effect of plantaricin Q7 on metabolites of glycerol
  phospholipid metabolic pathway in the inhibition group. The black words in Figure
  7A represent metabolites with no significant changes, while the green words represent
  metabolites with significant changes. Green ↑ indicates up-regulation and green
  ↓ indicates down-regulation. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001
