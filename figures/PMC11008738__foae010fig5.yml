caption: Model of the nutrient metabolism pathways and cell cycle-associated Sch9/Rim15
  signaling network for the longevity of CI mutants. Under carbon source starvation
  conditions, PKA and TOR (extrinsic pathway) are downregulated; this downregulation
  results in the upregulation of Rim15. The upregulated Rim15 inactivates the PP2A
  phosphatase activity, leading to the dephosphorylation of Mpk1. This, in turn, releases
  the inhibitory roles of Sic1 on Cln1,2/Cdk1 (the cyclin-dependent kinase complexes
  that activate S phase), thus accelerating the S phase entry (Lu et al. 2011). AMPK/Snf1
  (intrinsic pathway), which is upregulated in all CI mutants, especially in nuo1Δ/Δ
  (Zhang et al. 2018), also regulates G2 to M phase transition. Protein kinases, transcription
  factors, and various other proteins related to CI mutant responses are colored orange
  and dark blue, respectively. Arrows and bars refer to direct (full line) or indirect
  (dashed line) activating and inhibitory interactions, respectively.
