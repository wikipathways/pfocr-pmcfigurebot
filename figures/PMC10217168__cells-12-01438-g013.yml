figure_title: Effect of probiotics on the inflammatory responses of LPS-treated IPEC-J2
  cells.
caption: 'Effect of probiotics on the inflammatory responses of LPS-treated IPEC-J2
  cells. The expression of inflammatory factors (A) and TLRs signaling pathway (B)
  in IPEC-J2 cells. IPEC-J2 cells were pre-incubated with probiotics (MOI = 100) for
  12 h and then treated with LPS (40 µg/mL) for 12 h. Results are mean ± standard
  deviation for three independent experiments. Significant differences versus Control
  group: # p < 0.05; ## p < 0.01. Significant differences versus LPS group: * p <
  0.05; ** p < 0.01'
