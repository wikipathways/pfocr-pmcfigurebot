figure_title: Effect of MPGI on the AMPK/ACC/CPT and AMPK/ULK1/LC3B signaling pathways
  in the liver.
caption: 'Effect of MPGI on the AMPK/ACC/CPT and AMPK/ULK1/LC3B signaling pathways
  in the liver. The results of Western blot analysis of p-AMPK, AMPK, p-ACC, ACC,
  and CPT1A in mice livers (A). Digitalized results of the Western blot analysis (B–D).
  The Western blot analysis of p-ULK1, ULK1, and LC3B in mice livers (E). Digitalized
  results of Western blot analysis in E (F,G). ND group, 1–2 wells; HFD group, 3–4
  wells; MET group, 5–6 wells; PSE group, 7–8 wells; GEN group, 9–10 wells; IQ group,
  11–12 wells; MPGI group, 13–14 wells. Each sample is a mixture of three independent
  mouse livers for each group. The data are presented as mean ± SEM. #, ##, and ###
  indicate significant difference at p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001 compared with
  the ND group; *, ** and *** indicate significant difference at p < 0.05, p < 0.01,
  and p < 0.001 compared with the HFD group'
