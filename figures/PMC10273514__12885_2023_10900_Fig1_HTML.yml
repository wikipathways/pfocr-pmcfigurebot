caption: 'Different expression and function analysis of immune-related genes: (A)
  Different expression heatmap of 555 immune-related genes in normal and tumor tissues.
  (B) Go analysis indicated that these immune-related genes are mainly related to
  immune cell proliferation, cytokine response and immune cell migration. (C) KEGG
  analysis indicated that the signaling pathway includes cytokine receptor interaction,
  MAPK pathway and antigen processing and presentation'
