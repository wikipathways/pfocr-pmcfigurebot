figure_title: NETs enhance cholesterol metabolism in Tregs through the SREBP2 pathway
caption: '(A) Top enriched pathways in NET-treated naive CD4+ T cells, compared with
  those in the nontreated group. (B) Heatmap of naive CD4+ T cells with or without
  NET treatment in cholesterol homeostasis. (C) Western blot images of SREBP2-regulated
  gene expression in naive CD4+ T cells. (D) The relative gene expression of SREBP2-regulated
  gene expression in naive CD4+ T cells. (E) Filipin staining of naive CD4+ T cells
  treated with or without NETs. Scale bars: 50 μm. (F) iTreg differentiation in NET-treated
  or control group with or without fatostatin treatment (n = 5). Each bar represents
  mean ± 95% CI. Data comparison between 2 groups was analyzed by unpaired t test.
  Statistical analysis for 3 or more groups was preformed using 1-way ANOVA. *P <
  0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001'
