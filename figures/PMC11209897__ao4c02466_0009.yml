caption: Illustration demonstrating aptamers versatility for identifying biomarkers
  using a variety of steps. (a) Study design for healthy and diseased individuals.
  (b) Samples collected from different biospecimens, such as blood, feces, and urine.
  (c) Pretreatment procedures are used to prepare them for data acquisition. (d) Data
  acquisition using mass spectrometry it is used to acquire data on the metabolites
  present in the samples. (e) Statistical analysis is performed to identify metabolites
  that are significantly different between healthy and diseased groups. (f) Biomarkers
  identify the putative biomarkers are identified based on their statistical significance
  and biological relevance. (g) Pathway analysis is performed to identify the biological
  pathways that are affected by the disease. (h) Biological interpretation for further
  analysis to validate potential biomarkers.
