figure_title: Clonal evolution of plasma cell dyscrasias.
caption: Clonal evolution of plasma cell dyscrasias. (a) A mature post-germinal B
  cell or plasma cell normally produces specific antibodies to aid in immune responses.
  (b) In some individuals, low levels of abnormal post-germinal B cells/plasma cells
  become clonally expanded (grey cells), producing a specific monoclonal-protein.
  This stage is called gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and is a premalignant
  condition. (c) Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is the progression of MGUS, with
  higher numbers of abnormal clonal plasma cells. SMM is still a premalignant condition.
  (d) Multiple myeloma is the overt malignant condition, with higher percentages of
  abnormal clonal plasma cells leading to organ damage (anemia, kidney injury, bone
  lesions, or hypercalcemia). While some genetic changes are considered primary events
  also present in MGUS and SMM stages, secondary events, such as MYC rearrangements,
  alterations/mutations in DNA damage response or DNA repair genes, or mutations in
  the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes are associated with progression
  to MM
