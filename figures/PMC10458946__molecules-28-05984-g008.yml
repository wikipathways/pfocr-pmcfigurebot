caption: An illustration of the roles of MyD88L and MyD88s in TLR4-MyD88 signaling
  pathway. The MyD88 splicing generates two isoforms, namely the full-length MyD88L
  and the MyD88s lacking the ID domain crucial for linking TLR-4 to the IRAK-myddosome
  complex. MyD88L can activate the IRAK-myddosome complex by linking it to TLR-4 since
  it has the ID domain, followed by NF-kB activation promoting the transcription of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, which upregulates inflammation. Moreover, NF-kB promotes
  the transcription of MyD88L, leading to the accumulation of many MyD88L isoforms
  that triggers its feedback inhibition by promoting the alternative splicing of MyD88s
  through the binding of MyD88L to the SF3A that causes exon 2 skipping to generate
  MyD88s lacking exon 2. The production of this ID domain lacking isoform is aimed
  at stopping the TLR-4/MyD88 signaling, followed by inhibition of cytokine production
  and downregulation of pro-inflammatory and subsequent inflammation. Image created
