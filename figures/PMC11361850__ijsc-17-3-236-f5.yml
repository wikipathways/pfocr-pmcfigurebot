caption: The mechanism by which mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (MSCs-Exos)
  regulates apoptosis and autophagy. Bone marrow stem cell (BMSC)-Exos can inhibit
  apoptosis by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. human umbilical cord
  (HUC)-MSCs-Exos can regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the Bcl-2/Bax
  axis to inhibit apoptosis. MSCs-Exos with miR-19b and miR-181c can inhibit apoptosis
  via the Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) signaling pathways. MSCs-Exos with
  miR-21 can inhibit apoptosis via the PTEN and PDCD4 signaling pathways. MSCs-Exos
  with miR-21-5p and miR-29b-3p can inhibit apoptosis by regulating the FasL signaling
  pathway and activating the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. MSCs-Exos with miR-381 can
  inhibit apoptosis via BRD4/WNT5A signaling pathways. MSCs-Exos with miR-499-5p inhibits
  the JNK3/MAPK10 and JNK3/c-jun signaling pathways to inhibit apoptosis. MSCs-Exos
  with miR-9-5p and miR-511-3P could regulate the HDAC5/FGF2 and TRAF6/S1P signaling
  pathways to inhibit apoptosis. MSCs-Exos could regulate the autophagy-related proteins
  LC3IIB and Beclin-1 to promote autophagy
