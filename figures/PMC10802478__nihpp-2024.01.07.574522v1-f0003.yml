figure_title: Basally active type I IFN pathway limits SARS-CoV-2 replication in a
  subset of ACE2(high) cells
caption: (A, B) SCC25, H596, OE21, Detroit 562 and Calu-3 cells were pretreated with
  1 μM ruxolitinib for 24 hours. Ifit1 and Mx1 expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR
  and expression levels are shown relative to untreated Calu-3 cells (set to 1). Data
  show the mean from n=2–4 independent biological replicates, error bars show the
  SEM. (C) SCC25, H596, OE21 and Detroit 562 cells were pretreated with DMSO (mock)
  or 1 μM ruxolitinib for 24 hours and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 2 i.u./cell
  in presence of DMSO or 1 μM ruxolitinib. RT-qPCR analysis shows cell-associated
  viral RNA levels at 72 hpi. Data show the mean from n=2 independent replicates,
  error bars show the SEM. (D-G) SCC25 cells transfected with 3 separate siRNAs targeting
  STAT2 (D), IRF9 (E), STAT1 (G) or a non-targeting control (NT) and polyclonal populations
  of SCC25 cells knocked out for IFNAR (KO) using two independent sgRNAs or transduced
  with a non-targeting (NT) control (F) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of
  2 i.u./cell. Cell-associated viral RNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR at 72 hpi. Y-axes
  indicate the relative expression ratio between knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) and
  the respective NT samples. Data display the mean of 5–6 independent replicates,
  error bars denote the SEM
