caption: Activation of the AKT pathway leads to resistance to Lenvatinib in HCC. (A)
  Western blotting analysis of the expression of total AKT and p-AKT in a panel of
  liver cancer cell lines. (B) Western blotting analysis of AKT and p-AKT expression
  in Hep3B and Huh7 cells with transduction of pCDH-AKT lentiviral particles. (C)
  Dose-response curves of Hep3B and Huh7 cells with vector or AKT overexpression treated
  with Lenvatinib. (D) Growth curve of control or AKT overexpressed Hep3B and Huh7
  cells treated with Lenvatinib (2.5 Î¼M). (E) Colony formation assay in Hep3B and
  Huh7 cells treated with Lenvatinib after overexpressed AKT or vector. (F) The quantification
  of the three independent assays shown in (E)
