caption: Single-cell sequencing revealed that CEBPB is a specific TF-regulon of GBM
  cluster 6. (A) New t-SNE analysis based on binary regulon activity, analyzed by
  SCENIC, is color-coded by glioma clusters. (B) Binary regulon activity matrix identifies
  the master TF-regulons in different glioma clusters. On the right, the primary TF-regulons
  of GBM cluster 6 are listed, along with the number of genes they regulate. Additionally,
  functional enrichment of GO, KEGG, and HALLMARK pathways associated with these regulons
  is provided. The pathways shown in the figure have a significance level of p < 0.05.
  (C) The scatter plot displays the ssGSEA enrichment scores of 22 TF-regulons in
  subcluster 6, arranged in ascending order based on their mean values. (D) The heatmap
  displays the relative mRNA expression levels of 22 transcription factors across
  13 glioma subclusters. (E) The expression distribution of CEBPB-regulons on the
  original t-SNE coordinates of 13 glioma clusters. The violin plot represents the
  expression of CEBPB in 13 glioma clusters. (F) Kaplan-Meier curves of patient survival
  stratified by the median of CEBPB expression level from TCGA GBM and Gravendeel-GBM
  databases. P values were determined by log-rank. (G) CEBPB expression in subtype
  (n = 162, PN; n = 198, CL; n = 165, MES) from the TCGA GBM database. Black bars
  indicate mean ± s.d. ***p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA with Tukey's method for multiple
  comparisons. (H) shows CEBPB expression in GBM patients with IDH1 status (n = 30,
  IDH1 mutation (MUT); n = 372, IDH1 wild type (WT); n = 123, unknown (NA)) in the
  TCGA GBM database. Data are represented as means ± s.d. ***p < 0.001; two-tailed
  unpaired t-test
