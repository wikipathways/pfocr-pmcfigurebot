caption: Elucidation of the EMT mechanism in fibrosis of asthmatic airway remodeling
  by Cl− channel. Activation or inactivation of Cl− channels by genetic manipulation
  or chemical compound changes the flow of Cl− and water molecule, leading to cell
  swelling or cell shrinkage. Activation or inactivation of Cl− channels by genetic
  manipulation or chemical compound also activates or inactivates specific signal
  pathways such as the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, TGF-β1/non-Smad signaling pathway,
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, SHH signaling pathway, and AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
  Consequently, Cl− channels may contribute to EMT in fibrosis of asthmatic airway
  remodeling
