figure_title: Inhibitory effects of 6PP on the NF-κB signaling pathway.
caption: 'Inhibitory effects of 6PP on the NF-κB signaling pathway. Raw264.7 cells
  were pretreated with 6PP (200 µM) for 2 h and then stimulated with LPS (0.5 µg/mL)
  for 15 min. (a) Western blot analysis of the phosphorylated and total IκB levels,
  with β-actin as the loading control. (b) NF-κB/p65 (red) nuclear translocation was
  analyzed using confocal microscopy. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).
  The data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Statistical
  differences between groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. # indicates
  p < 0.05 vs. the LPS-untreated group; * indicates p < 0.05 vs. the LPS-treated group.
  ns indicates not significant. Scale bar: 10 µm. IκB, an inhibitor of κB; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor kappa B'
