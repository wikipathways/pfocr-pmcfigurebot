caption: The expression levels of miR-766-3p, COL1A1 and PI3K/AKT in different stomach
  tumor tissues and normal gastric tissues. (A) The downstream pathway of COL1A1;
  (B) MiR-766-3p mRNA expression; (C) COL1A1 mRNA expression; (D) PI3K mRNA expression;
  (E) AKT mRNA expression; (F) COL1A1, PI3K and p-AKT protein expression in normal
  tissue and GC tissue; (G) The relative quantitative expression of COL1A1. (H) The
  relative quantitative expression of PI3K. (I) The relative quantitative expression
  of P-AKT. Statistical significance is expressed as ****P < 0.0001, ***P<0.001, **P<0.01
  and *P<0.05
