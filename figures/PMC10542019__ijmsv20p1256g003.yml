  environment.
caption: Mitochondrial damage and mtDNA damage leakage in cells in a high-lactate
  environment. (A) JC-1 staining was used to observe mitochondrial damage. (B) ROS
  changes in cells stained with DCFH-DA, indicating negative results. (C) mtDNA copy
  number and damage of A253 cells incubated with lactate. (D) mtDNA copy number and
  damage of A253 cells in 30 mM lactate, 15 mM DCA or both for 24 h. (E) Immunofluorescence
  staining of mtDNA; red indicates mitochondria, and blue (DAPI) indicates DNA. (F)
  Immunohistochemistry showing STING expression in the labial glands of human pSS
  patients. (G) Western blot analysis of the expression of free DNA receptors, IFN
  and NF-κB upstream signaling pathway in A253 cells. (H) IP was used to verify the
  degree of STING ubiquitination in 30 mM lactate environment
