figure_title: C5aR2 KO amplifies expression and phosphorylation of cGAS-STING pathway
  proteins.
caption: 'C5aR2 KO amplifies expression and phosphorylation of cGAS-STING pathway
  proteins. PMA-differentiated wild-type or C5aR2 KO THP-1 cells were stimulated with
  5 μg/mL STING agonist cAIM(PS)2 Difluor (Rp/Sp) for 6 h. (A,B) Lysates were assessed
  for expression and phosphorylation of cGAS-STING pathway proteins STING and IRF3
  by Peggy Sue. (C–G) Area under the curve for each protein was normalised to β-actin.
  Mean ± SD. N = 3 wild-type replicates and C5aR2 KO clones represented by shapes;
  Circle: D3. Square: F3. Triangle: F7. Grey; NTC, Red; C5aR2 edited, light; vehicle,
  dark; agonist'
