figure_title: a-e, Proportion of tissues with the same signs of associations with
  age (a), proportion of tissues with statistically significant associations with
  age (b), Proportion of tissues with agreeing signs of age associations and SnG senescence
  directions (c), log odds ratios for G1 cell cycle enrichment in human (left) and
  mouse (right) (d), and PPI scores in human (left) and mouse (right) (e).
caption: a-e, Proportion of tissues with the same signs of associations with age (a),
  proportion of tissues with statistically significant associations with age (b),
  Proportion of tissues with agreeing signs of age associations and SnG senescence
  directions (c), log odds ratios for G1 cell cycle enrichment in human (left) and
  mouse (right) (d), and PPI scores in human (left) and mouse (right) (e). “*” means
  p-value < 0.05 and p-value > 0.01. “**” means p-value < 0.01 and p-value > 0.001.
  “ns.” means not statistically significant. Dots stand for averaged numbers. f, Human
  PPI network of the core senescence gene set. g, Proportion of SnCs in each tissue
  and cell type in human (left) and mouse (right). Overall proportion is calculated
  as SnC proportion across all cell types within a tissue (rows) or across all tissues
  within a cell type (column). h, Overall SnC proportions of each cell type in human
  and mouse. Top five cell types are highlighted in red. i, CellChat interaction targets
  of SnCs in human trachea tissue. j, CellChat interaction pathways in human trachea
  tissue. k, SnC interaction target strengths in each tissue and cell type in human
  (left) and mouse (right). l, Averaged SnC interaction target strengths of each cell
  type in human and mouse. Top five cell types are highlighted in red. m, SnC interaction
  pathway strengths in each tissue and cell type in human (left) and mouse (right).
  n, Averaged SnC interaction pathway strengths of each pathway in human and mouse.
  Top five pathways are highlighted in red
