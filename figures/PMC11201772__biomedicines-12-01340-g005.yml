caption: Nested pie chart represents the DEGs in cell cycle KEGG pathway (mmu04110),
  resulting from the comparison of 20 µM CBN-treated cells vs. CTRL. The chart is
  divided into the different phases of the cell cycle, and the DEGs were associated
  with a specific phase using Uniprot. The red boxes indicate the upregulated genes,
  and the green ones the downregulated genes. A color map of the fold changes for
  each DEG indicates the magnitude of differential expression for each gene (schematically
  reported in Table S2)
