figure_title: The GPR19 energy and DNA management signature is associated with oncological
  pathways.
caption: The GPR19 energy and DNA management signature is associated with oncological
  pathways. Using an unbiased metabolic pathways dataset (created using GLAD4U (http://glad4u.zhang-lab.org/index.php)
  GeneShot (https://maayanlab.cloud/geneshot/) and PubPular (https://heart.shinyapps.io/PubPular/),
  the protein identity overlap between the GPR19-BRCA1 (A)/ATM (B)/CHEK2 (C) MSigDB-CGP
  datasets and this metabolism dataset was found. The numerical extent of these specific
  dataset overlaps (black bars) was significantly greater than that expected from
  similarly sized random datasets (grey bars). STRING network analysis of the combined
  overlapping proteins (from the specific intersections in (A–C) revealed a potent
  multifactorial association of these DNA and energy management proteins with oncological
  pathways (D,E). The histogram in (F) depicts the most significantly populated NCBI-PubMed
  manuscript searches using the compounded data shown in the networks (D) (plain)
  and (E) (proteins color coded to the histogram bars in (F). Histogram-based data
  shown represent the means ± SEM (standard error of the mean). The significance level
  is indicated in each figure as ** p ≤ 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001
