caption: IDMF hypothesized mechanisms of therapeutic effect. IDMF activates NRF2-dependent
  signaling (red arrows) while inhibiting NF-κB activity and transcription of downstream
  genes (blue). IDMF triggers dissociation of NRF2 from KEAP1 to allow nuclear translocation
  of NRF2. Nuclear NRF2 dimerizes with musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (Maf) and binds
  antioxidant response elements (ARE) to induce the transcription of target genes,
  such as HMOX1. The HMOX1 protein then acts as an enzyme to catalyze the formation
  of antioxidants such as bilirubin and biliverdin, while also inhibiting nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS). Together, these effects of HMOX1 reduce accumulation of reactive
  oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) to attenuate oxidative stress.
  The inhibition of NF-κB by IDMF prevents nuclear translocation and up-regulation
  of target genes such as ICAM1, CXCL8, IL6, and IRF1. Reduced expression of these
  targets leads to reduced inflammation via attenuation of ICAM1-dependent leukocyte
  adhesion, cytokine production with cytokine storm, and IRF1/CASP4-dependent inflammasome
  activation. Overall dampening of these inflammatory processes inhibits pyroptosis
  and, thus, limits progression of demyelination. See text for details. (Figure created
