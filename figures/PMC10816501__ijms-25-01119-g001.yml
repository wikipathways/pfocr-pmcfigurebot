figure_title: RNA-seq reveals upregulation of MAPK pathway-related genes in MSC-induced
  MDSCs.
caption: RNA-seq reveals upregulation of MAPK pathway-related genes in MSC-induced
  MDSCs. (A) Experimental design. CD11bhiLy6ChiLy6Glo cells were isolated from BM
  cells cultured for 5 d under GM-CSF stimulation (40 ng/mL) without MSC coculture.
  CD11bmidLy6CmidLy6Glo cells were sorted from GM-CSF-stimulated BM cells with MSC
  coculture. Both cell populations were comparatively analyzed via RNA-seq. (B) The
  KEGG pathway analysis using the DAVID tool. The MAPK signaling pathway included
  the highest number of genes upregulated in MSC-induced MDSCs (marked with red stars)
