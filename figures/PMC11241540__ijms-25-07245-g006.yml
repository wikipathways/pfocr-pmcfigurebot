caption: Network of interactions among differentially expressed genes using STRING
  from the 744 differentially expressed genes identified in Arabidopsis plants over-expressing
  PrMADS11; only those with interactions are shown. The genes were separated into
  three clusters., cluster 1 in baby blue, cluster 2 in green and cluster 3 in red.
  Within the rectangle, the interaction between the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway
  (PAL4*) and a series of TFs is shown. Each node represents the interaction described
  in the literature between the proteins
