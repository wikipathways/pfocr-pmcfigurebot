caption: 'UCA1 regulates IMPDH1/2 involvement in guanine nucleotide de novo synthesis.
  A, Analysis of metabolic pathways of differential expression between bladder cancer
  and adjacent tissues by TCGA database. B, ATP levels in cellular. UCA1 knockdown
  group (control: pRNAT-N; experimental: pRNAT-U) and UCA1 overexpression group (control:
  pcDNA-M; experimental: pcDNA-U). C, GTP levels in cellular. D, Purine nucleotide
  synthesis-related enzyme expression were detected by qRT-PCR. E, Western blotting
  results of IMPDH1 and IMPDH2 proteins expression were found in UCA1 knockdown cells
  or UCA1 overexpression cells. F, Purine synthesis pathway. Red font indicates rate-limiting
  enzyme. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM for qRT-PCR and mean ± SD for other analyses.
  ns, no significance. All experiments were repeated more than three times. ns, no
  significance; * p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001'
