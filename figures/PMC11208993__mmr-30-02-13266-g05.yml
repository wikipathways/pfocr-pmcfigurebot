caption: 'LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cocultured with H/R-induced H9C2 cells.
  (A) Representative western blotting images of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in
  LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Quantitative analysis of (B) p-JAK2 and (C) p-STAT3.
  (D) LDH and (E) CK activity in cell culture supernatant of H9C2 cells pretreated
  with CM obtained from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. **P<0.01, *P<0.05 vs.
  Control group. ##P<0.01, #P<0.05 vs. LPS + PBS group. ▽P<0.05 vs LPS + BMSC-Exo
  group. &&P<0.01, &P<0.05 vs. H/R + CM1 group. All data were presented as mean ±
  SD. Exo, exosome; BMSC, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  JAK2, Janus kinase 2; p-, phosphorylated; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; CK, creatine kinase; CM, conditioned
  medium'
