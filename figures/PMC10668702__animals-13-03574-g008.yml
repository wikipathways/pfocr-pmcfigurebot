figure_title: Pearson correlation analysis of ALP-dependent Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway-induced
  antioxidants with LPS/ROS-induced gut barrier dysfunctions, systemic inflammation,
  growth performance, and metabolic syndrome at 45 d (A), 60 d (B), and (C) 90 d.
caption: Pearson correlation analysis of ALP-dependent Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway-induced
  antioxidants with LPS/ROS-induced gut barrier dysfunctions, systemic inflammation,
  growth performance, and metabolic syndrome at 45 d (A), 60 d (B), and (C) 90 d.
  In the correlation heatmaps, the significant correlations were represented as (r
  > 0.52 or r < âˆ’0.52, p < 0.01). The size of the circle and its color intensity are
  proportional to the correlation values
