caption: Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer and distinction between mutational
  and non-mutational causes. (a) Mutations within the respective genes of β-catenin
  (CTNNB1), APC, Axin1/2, RNF43, and ZNRF3 have all in common to stabilize β-catenin
  and ubiquitously activate transcription of downstream genes. Mutations in RNF and
  ZNRF3 mutations additionally lead to higher FZD-receptor density and DNA-microsatellite
  instability. (b) Kinases with enhanced activities uncontrollably phosphorylate components
  of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, including β-catenin, LRP5/6, Dishevelled
  (Dvl), GSK3β, Axin1/2, and TCF/LEF. Excessive phosphorylation of β-catenin, LRP5/6,
  Dvl, and GSK3β stabilize β-catenin while phosphorylation of Axin, APC, and TCF/LEF
  attenuates β-catenin. However, decreased activities and lower phosphorylation rates
  for Axin1/2 and TCF/LEF can also result in the stabilization of β-catenin. This
