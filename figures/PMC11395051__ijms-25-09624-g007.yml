caption: Summary of the results and the proposed mechanisms of action of the examined
  proteins and signaling pathways in HEC-1A cells. Macrophage-derived factors increase
  the fractalkine, IL-6, LIF, and TGFβ secretion of HEC-1A endometrial cells, activating
  the MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, the treatment of HEC-1A cells with the conditioned
  medium of the activated THP-1 cells elevated the production of the EGF, which can
  contribute to MAPK activation and proliferation. The MAPK pathway regulates the
  MMP2 and MMP9 involved in the invasion, which are also under the control of activin,
  BMP2, and TGFβ-regulated SMAD transcription factors. The MAPK signaling enhances
  the synthesis of the Nrf2 antioxidant transcription factor, which in turn activates
  the production of SOD2 and catalase antioxidant enzymes. The FKN/CX3CR1 interaction
  supports the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
