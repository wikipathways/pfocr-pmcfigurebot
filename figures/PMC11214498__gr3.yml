caption: '(A) TUNEL detection of apoptotic signals. DMF ameliorated apoptosis. The
  results were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. *: p < 0.05 in comparison
  to control. #: p < 0.05 in comparison to the model group. (B) Representative HE
  staining in kidney tissue of rats. In the model group, glomerular atrophy (black
  arrows) and detachment of tubular epithelial cells (green arrows) were observed.
  In the 12.5 mg DMF group, improvement of glomerular lesions was observed, with haemorrhage
  in the tubulointerstitial space (red arrows); glomerular lesions in the 25 mg and
  50 mg DMF groups tended to be normalised; and tubular lesions did not show any significant
  changes. *: p < 0.05 in comparison to control. #: p < 0.05 in comparison to the
  model group. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
  the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
