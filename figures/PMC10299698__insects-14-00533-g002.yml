figure_title: Normalized expression levels of different genes in response to oral
  ingestion of Hv1c and TRTX (111.
caption: 'Normalized expression levels of different genes in response to oral ingestion
  of Hv1c and TRTX (111.5 µM for 48 h) by Drosophila suzukii flies. Transcripts associated
  with cytochrome P450 pathway: (a) adenylyl cyclase13E (ac13E); (b) cytochrome P450
  12d1 distal (cyp12d1-d). Transcript associated with HSPs expression: (c) heat shock
  protein 70 cognate 4 (hsc70-4). Transcripts associated with insulin-like receptor/TOR
  pathway: (d) substrate of the product of InR (chico); (e) forkhead box, sub-group
  O (foxo); (f) superoxide dismutase 2 (sod2). Transcripts associated with apoptotic
  stimuli: (g) death caspase-1 (dcp-1); (h) death-associated inhibitor of apoptosis
  1 (diap1). Vertical bars: mean values with standard deviation (n = 3); * represents
  statistically significant differences (p < 0.05)'
