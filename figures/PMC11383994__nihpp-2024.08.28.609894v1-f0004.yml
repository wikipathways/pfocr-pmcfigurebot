figure_title: Integrative omics analysis yields pY sites that predict HFD-induced
  changes in metabolites
caption: '(A) Selected integrative map depicting pY sites and metabolites in pathways
  for purine degradation, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), redox homeostasis, fatty
  acid (FA) metabolism, and anaplerosis/cataplerosis. (B) Scatter plot of metabolite
  PLSR predictive score (Q2) vs fold change in Log2(HFD/NCD) where metabolites with
  valid model are color-coded by pathway. Each metabolite (Y-matrix) was regressed
  against the top 50% of pY sites with greatest change in magnitude (X-matrix) with
  k-fold cross-validation (see Methods). A model prediction score (Q2) â‰¥ 0.4 was used
  as an indicator of metabolites predicted by pY sites without overfitting. (C) Stacked
  histogram plot illustrating the frequency of predictive pY sites and their respective
  distances from functional domains and interface region. (D) Scatter plot of representative
  PLSR model coefficients vs Log2(HFD/NCD) of pY sites for uridine monophosphate (UMP),
  each datapoint is a pY site. PLSR coefficient indicates a positive (red) or negative
  (blue) relationship between UMP and the pY site. Highlighted sites are on enzymes
  in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway: Umps Y37 and Cps1 Y590, Y1450, and
  Y852'
