caption: Depiction of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone System (RAAS) and classic
  metabolic pathway. Low systemic blood pressure (BP) will stimulate kidney renin
  release to promote angiotensin I (AngI) cleavage from liver-expressed angiotensinogen.
  This is followed by converting AngI to angiotensin II (AngII) via angiotensin-converting
  enzyme (ACE). AngII then acts to increase BP via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor
  through direct vasoconstrictive actions and secondary signaling increasing vasopressin
  and aldosterone release. The production of AngII then inhibits further renin release
  through negative biofeedback (shown as a dotted line)
