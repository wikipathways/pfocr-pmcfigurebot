figure_title: HDAC4 was identified as the candidate target of m6A under hypoxic conditions
caption: A The starplot showed the distribution of genes with both differential (up
  or down) expression (X axis; fold change > 2 or < 0.5, P < 0.05) in hypoxic group
  compared with normoxic group. The blue dots represented up-regulated transcripts
  with the decreased abundance of m6A under hypoxic conditions, which were selected
  for the further analysis. B KEGG pathway analysis of m6A-hypo-up genes in response
  to hypoxia. C Real-time PCR showing the mRNA expression level of candidate target
  genes in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells cultured under normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia
  (1% O2) for 48 h. Error bars indicate means ± SEM, n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 and ns not significant. D CITED2 and HDAC4 protein levels were measured
  in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells under normoxia or hypoxia for 48 h by western blot.
  n = 3 independent experiments. E PANC-1 or MIA PaCa-2 cells were transfected with
  a shNC or sh-ALKBH5, and incubated under normoxia or hypoxia for 48 h. HDAC4 protein
  expression level were examined by western blot, with β-actin as the loading control.
  n = 3 independent experiments. F Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) plots showing
  methylation levels of representative genes upon oxygen deprivation (1% O2, 48 h)
  (gray indicates input data, blue indicates IP data). G Reduction in m6A modification
  in specific regions of HDAC4 under hypoxic (1% O2) conditions, as assessed by gene-specific
  m6A-RIP-qPCR assays in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. The value obtained for the control
  group was set to 1. Error bars indicate means ± SEM, n = 3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01,
  ***P < 0.001 and ns not significant.
