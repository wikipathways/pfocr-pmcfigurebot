  inflammatory response pathway in the kidney in Lagovirus europaeus infection.
caption: 'Contribution of miRs/target genes involved in the innate immune and inflammatory
  response pathway in the kidney in Lagovirus europaeus infection. In the kidney,
  an increase in miR-223 during infection of both virus genotypes inhibits TLR4 (Spearman’s
  rank correlation Rho: −0.84, p = 0.002 for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation
  Rho: −0.7, p = 0.02 for GI.2), IKKα (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.85, p =
  0.0016 for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.92, p < 0.001 for GI.2)
  and NLRP3 (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.91, p < 0.001 for GI.1 and Spearman’s
  rank correlation Rho: −0.95, p < 0.001 for GI.2). Upregulation of miR-155 correlates
  negatively with MyD88 (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.75, p = 0.01 for GI.1
  and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.92, p < 0.001 for GI.2) and p65 (Spearman’s
  rank correlation Rho: −0.8, p = 0.005 for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho:
  −0.98, p < 0.001 for GI.2), resulting in inhibition of expression. MiR-146a inhibits
  the IRAK1 (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.95, p < 0.001 for GI.1 and Spearman’s
  rank correlation Rho: −0.92, p < 0.001 for GI.2) and TRAF6 (Spearman’s rank correlation
  Rho: −0.92, p < 0.001 for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.92, p < 0.001
  for GI.2) target genes'
