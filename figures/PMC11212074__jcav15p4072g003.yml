caption: GNL3L knockdown inhibited AML cell proliferation and induced G1/S cell cycle
  arrest. (A) AML cells proliferated slower after knocking down GNL3L. (B) Number
  of colonies AML cells formed decreased after knocking down GNL3L. (C) AML cells
  were blocked at the G1/S cell cycle transition after GNL3L was knocked down. (D)
  Cyclin D1 and CDK2 were down-regulated in AML cells after knocking down GNL3L.
