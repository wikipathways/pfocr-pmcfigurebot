  pathway.
caption: 'Livisin promotes keratinocyte migration through the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway.
  (a) Effect of livisin on keratinocytes migration after blocking EGFR. The keratinocytes
  were pretreated with EGFR-specific inhibitor AG1478 (160 nM) for 1 h, then stimulated
  with 5 × 10−10 M livisin. Images were captured immediately after scratching (0 h)
  and 24 h. Scale bars: 200 μm; (b) effect of livisin on keratinocytes migration after
  blocking ERK1/2. The keratinocytes were pretreated with ERK1/2-specific inhibitor
  SCH772984 (2 nM), then stimulated with 5 × 10−10 M livisin. Images were captured
  immediately after scratching (0 h) and 24 h. Scale bars: 200 μm; (c) three independent
  results were quantified for (a) using ImageJ; (d) three independent results were
  quantified for (b) using ImageJ. All graphical data are the means ± SEMs from three
  determinations. “*” and “***” indicate significant differences from the control
  cells at the p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 levels, respectively. “ns” indicates no significant
  difference'
