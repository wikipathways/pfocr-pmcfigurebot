figure_title: HJ suppresses the expression of inflammatory mediators by regulating
  the NF-κB p65 signalling pathway in LPS-stimulated RAW264.
caption: HJ suppresses the expression of inflammatory mediators by regulating the
  NF-κB p65 signalling pathway in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. (A-H) RAW 264.7 cells
  were stimulated using LPS (1 µg/ml) for 24 h after pretreatment with HJ (800 µg/ml)
  and luteolin (25 µM) for 1 h. Gene expression levels of (A) Chemokine ligand 3,
  (B) Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2, (C) IL-1β, (D) IL-6, (E) TNF-α, (F) COX2 and
  (G) iNOS were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Gene expression levels were normalized to
  18S rRNA and shown as the fold change relative to the normal control. (H) Protein
  levels of COX2 and iNOS were detected using western blot analysis. Protein bands
  were quantified and normalized using GAPDH as loading control and expressed as fold
  change relative to the normal control. (I) RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated using
  LPS (1 µg/ml) for 3 h after pretreatment with HJ (800 µg/ml) and luteolin (25 µM)
  for 1 h. Protein levels of NF-κB p65 and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 were detected
  using western blot analysis. The protein level of NF-κB p65 was quantified and normalized
  using GAPDH as the loading control. p-NF-κB p65 was quantified and normalized using
  the total NF-κB p65 level. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
  and analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001
  vs. LPS-treated group. HJ, Humulus japonicus; CCL3, chemokine ligand 3; CXCL2, chemokine
  (C-X-C motif) ligand 2; COX2, cyclooxygenase-2; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase;
  p-, phsopho-; LPS, lipopolysaccharide
