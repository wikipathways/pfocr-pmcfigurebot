figure_title: Gene expression profile of nitrogen metabolism-related genes under dehydration
  and rehydration stress conditions.
caption: 'Gene expression profile of nitrogen metabolism-related genes under dehydration
  and rehydration stress conditions. (a) Heatmap showing the hierarchical clustering
  of the DEGs involved in nitrogen metabolism. The expression levels of each gene
  are normalized into z-score. Dots on the right side represent the role of each gene
  in nitrogen metabolism pathways. C: control, D: dehydration, R: rehydration. (bâ€“d)
  Expression patterns of selected genes involved in nitrogen uptake (b), nitrogen
  assimilation (c), and nitrogen signaling pathway (d). The normalized expression
  levels of each gene under control (C), dehydration (D), and rehydration (R) conditions
  are represented from RNA-seq data. Statistical significance was determined by EdgeR
  program. The asterisks indicate significant difference (*** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.05;
  * p < 0.01; and ns: p > 0.01)'
