figure_title: Genome wide CRISPR screen identifies Klf2 suppressors
caption: '(a) Schematic of the Klf2 reporter stably expressed in Mouse Aortic Endothelial
  Cells (MAEC). Destabilized EGFP (d2EGFP) is driven by the Klf2 promoter while mCherry
  is driven by a constitutive PGK promoter as an internal control. (b) Schematic of
  the genome wide CRISPR screen to identify modifiers (activators and suppressors)
  of Klf2 induction under laminar shear stress (LSS; 15 dyn/cm2 LSS for 16 h). (c)
  Functional categorization of the candidate Klf2 suppressors (cumulative z score
  >4, 160 hits) using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen). (d) candidate suppressors
  intersecting with ‘cell-surface exposed proteins on outer plasma membrane’ GO term
  to identify candidates amenable to function neutralization by blocking antibodies
  (red box: validated hits). (e) Klf2:GFP reporter MAECs were transduced with Cas9
  plus Control sg, Pcdhga9 sg or with a human Pcdhga9 (Hs Pcdhga9) vector. Cells were
  exposed to static (St), LSS, or disturbed oscillatory shear stress (OSS) for 16
  h and immunoblotted for Klf2:GFP (N=3). Graph: quantitation of Klf2:GFP normalized
  to Tubulin loading control. (f) Immunoblot for the inflammatory marker VCAM1 in
  Control or Pcdhga9 depleted MAECs exposed to St, LSS or OSS (N=3). Graph: quantitation
  of VCAM1 normalized to Tubulin loading control. (g) THP-1 monocyte binding to Control
  si or Pcdhga9 si Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) exposed to St or
  OSS for 16 h (N=4). Graph: quantitation of bound THP1 monocytes per field (THP1
  binding index). Statistical analysis used one-way ANOVA. Scale bar: (g) 100 μm'
