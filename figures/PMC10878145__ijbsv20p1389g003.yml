figure_title: UPP1 knockdown upregulates cellular ROS levels and promotes apoptosis
  in BLCA through the AKT signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo.
caption: 'UPP1 knockdown upregulates cellular ROS levels and promotes apoptosis in
  BLCA through the AKT signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. (A) Flow cytometric
  analysis revealed that UPP1 knockdown upregulated ROS levels in UM-UC-3 cells. (B)
  Statistical chart of the apoptosis rates of UM-UC-3 cells evaluated using flow cytometry.
  (C) GSEA based on TCGA dataset. (D) Immunoblotting analysis revealed that UPP1 knockdown
  suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 and Thr308, downregulated anti-apoptotic
  proteins, and upregulated pro-apoptotic proteins in UM-UC-3 cells. UPP1 overexpression
  reversed the expression trend of these proteins in T24 cells. (E) H&E and IHC staining
  of subcutaneous Vector-transfected and UPP1-transfected T24 cell-derived xenograft
  tumors. (F) Immunoblotting indicates that UPP1 overexpression could promote AKT
  phosphorylation and inhibit apoptosis of BLCA cells in vivo. *: p < 0.05; **: p
  < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001; ns: not significant (p > 0.05)'
