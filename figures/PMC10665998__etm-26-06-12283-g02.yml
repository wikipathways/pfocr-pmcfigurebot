  axis.
caption: Involvement of IRS1 and the PI3K/AKT pathway in the lncRNA PEG13/miR-195
  axis. (A) Venn diagram showing potential targets for lncRNA PEG13, determined from
  the joint analysis of TargetScan and GSE109048 datasets. (B) Bubble map showing
  genes involved in atherosclerosis-related pathways in the GSE109048 dataset. (C)
  Levels of IRS1 expression in the presence of various doses of ox-LDL, as determined
  through RT-qPCR analysis (*P<0.05 vs. 0 µg/ml). (D) Levels of IRS1 expression following
  PEG13 overexpression, as determined through RT-qPCR analysis. (E) Levels of IRS1
  expression after miR-195 mimic/inhibitor treatment, as determined through RT-qPCR
  analysis. (F) Potential binding sites between IRS1 and miR-195, as determined through
  bioinformatics analysis. (G) Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmation of IRS1
  as a direct target of miR-195. (H) Levels of IRS1 expression in HUVECs transfected
  with siRNA, as determined through RT-qPCR analysis. (I) IRS1 protein levels in HUVECs
  transfected with siRNA, as determined through western blot analysis. *P<0.05. IRS1,
  insulin receptor substrate 1; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA; miR, microRNA; ox-LDL,
  oxidized low-density lipoprotein; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR;
  HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT,
  wild type; mut, mutant; ov, overexpression; NC, negative control
