figure_title: RSV alleviates PA-induced lipid deposition and insulin resistance in
  C2C12 cells.
caption: 'RSV alleviates PA-induced lipid deposition and insulin resistance in C2C12
  cells. (A) Survival rates of C2C12 cells after treatment with PA and RSV. (B) Glucose
  concentration in the culture medium was decreased after RSV treatment for 24 h.
  (C) Lipid deposition was decreased in Oil red O-stained C2C12 cells after RSV treatment;
  magnification, ×400, scale bar, 100 µm. (D) TG content in C2C12 cells was decreased
  after RSV treatment. (E) Effects of RSV treatment on the mRNA expression levels
  of insulin pathway indicators in C2C12 cells. (F) Effects of RSV treatment on the
  protein expression levels of insulin pathway indicators in C2C12 cells after RSV
  treatment. (G) Semi-quantification of p-protein/t-protein ratios for insulin pathway
  indicators and protein expression levels of GLUT4 in C2C12 cells after RSV treatment.
  All cells were treated with 100 nM insulin for 30 min before (B) detection of glucose
  contents and (F) western blotting. Data are presented as the mean ± SD (n=3). *P<0.05
  vs. CON, #P<0.05 vs. PA. CON, control; RSV, resveratrol; PA, palmitic acid; IRS-1,
  insulin receptor substrate-1; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; p-, phosphorylated;
  t-t, total; TG, triglyceride'
