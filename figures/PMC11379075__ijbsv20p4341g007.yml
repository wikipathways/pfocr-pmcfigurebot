figure_title: M2 macrophages regulate the expression of METTL3 through IL-6/STAT3
  signaling pathway.
caption: M2 macrophages regulate the expression of METTL3 through IL-6/STAT3 signaling
  pathway. (A) ELISA was used to measure the level of IL-6 protein in macrophages
  incubated with MHCC97H-derived exosomes or SLC16A1AS-1 knockdown exosomes. (B) The
  mRNA (left) and protein (right) levels of METTL3 in HCC cells incubated with CM,
  Exo-CM with IgG, or Exo-CM with IL-6Ab, respectively. (C) The mRNA (left) and protein
  (right) levels of METTL3 in HCC cells were treated with different concentrations
  of IL-6 cytokine. (D) The levels of SLC16A1-AS1 in HCC cells treated with different
  concentrations of IL-6 cytokine. (E) Western blot analysis of MHCC97H cells alone,
  MHCC97H cells incubated with CM, Exo-CM, Exo-CM with IL-6Abs or AS1-KD exo-CM with
  rhIL-6. (F) The mRNA (left) and protein (right) levels of METTL3 in HCC cells alone,
  HCC cells incubated with CM, Exo-CM or Exo-CM with Stattic. (G) Correlation analysis
  of METTL3 and STAT3 in HCC. (H) ChIP-Seq tracks from the UCSC database (http://genome.ucsc.edu/)
  show the enrichments of H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and STAT3 across the METTL3 promoter sequence.
  (I) Prediction of the consensus STAT3 binding sequence was presented via the JASPAR
  database. (J) The illustration shows the binding site of STAT3 to the METTL3 promoter
  region. (K) Relative enrichment of STAT3 to METTL3 promoter was detected by ChIP
  assays in MHCC97H cells. (L) Schematic representation of the mutant sequence (left).
  Luciferase reporter assays show the relative activity of METTL3 promoter in MHCC97H
  cells containing WT or MUT reporter vector. These cells were further treated with
  CM, Exo-CM, and Exo-CM with IL-6Abs, or rhIL-6 (right). (M) Relative enrichment
  of STAT3 to METTL3 promoter was detected by ChIP assays in MHCC97H cells treated
  with CM, Exo-CM, Exo-CM+IL-6Abs, or rhIL-6 (left). The PCR products were run on
  a 2% agarose gel (right)
