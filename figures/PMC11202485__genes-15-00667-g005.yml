  stages.
caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs at the 80 kg and 120 kg body weight stages.
  (A) KEGG pathway word cloud annotation at the 80 kg body weight stage. As the font
  size of a word increases, its frequency in the terms also increases. The colors
  of different entries are randomly assigned. (B) Taxonomic summary of the pathways
  at the 80 kg body weight stage. (C) Top 20 pathways at the 80 kg body weight stage.
  (D) Top 10 pathways and their enriched gene interactions at the 80 kg body weight
  stage. (E) KEGG pathway word cloud annotation at the 120 kg body weight stage. As
  the font size of a word increases, its frequency in the terms also increases. The
  colors of different entries are randomly assigned. (F) Taxonomic summary of the
  pathways at the 120 kg body weight stage. (G) Top 20 pathways at the 120 kg body
  weight stage. (H) Top 10 pathways and their enriched gene interactions at the 120
  kg body weight stage. Red and blue squares indicate gene up- and down-regulation,
  respectively
