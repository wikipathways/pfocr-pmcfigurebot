figure_title: Cancer pathway activity and drug sensitivity analysis of SFXN4 in HCC.
caption: Cancer pathway activity and drug sensitivity analysis of SFXN4 in HCC. (A)
  Potential cancer pathway activity regulated by SFXN4 in HCC. The color red (or green)
  indicates the percentage of HCCs in which pathways may be activated (or inhibited)
  by SFXN4 (GSCALite). (B) Drug sensitivity analysis of SFXN4 in HCC. Positive (or
  negative) correlation indicated high expression of SFXN4 is resistant (or responsive)
  to the drug (GSCALite)
