figure_title: GPR19 expression is altered in an accelerated aging murine model.
caption: 'GPR19 expression is altered in an accelerated aging murine model. Using
  transcriptome profiling, we investigated the expression levels of GPR19 in GIT2KO
  (GIT2−knockout) mice (n = 3): (A). GPR19 expression levels were elevated in both
  central nervous system tissues (cortex (ctx), hippocampus (hippo), and hypothalamus
  (hypo)), as well as peripheral tissues (pancreas (panc), and liver (liv)) compared
  to wild-type (WT) littermates (n = 3). GAPDH expression was employed as an expression
  control. (B) GPR19 expression alteration results were replicated using Western blotting;
  beta-actin (ACTB) loading control was used. Hence, GPR19 expression was potentiated
  in the GIT2KO mice (#1,2,3) compared to control wild-type (WT: #1,2,3) animals (n
  = 3). The significant alterations of GPR19 expression in the advanced aging model
  GIT2KO are represented in the associated histogram (C). Ectopic expression of an
  HA-epitope tagged human WT GPR19 clone in HEK293 cells was demonstrated using a
  cDNA transfection level series from 0.5, 1, 2,5, and 10 μg (D). Cells were lysed
  at 24 h post-transfection and HA-tagged GPR19 expression was confirmed with selective
  Western blot. The optimal time course of expression of the median expression level
  (i.e., 2 μg) was assessed and found to be optimal at the standard 24 h time period
  following cDNA transfection (E). Differential compartment protein extraction was
  performed (cytoplasmic = solid line; plasma membrane = dotted line; nucleus/organelles
  = dashed line) before untargeted proteomic expression analysis (red bar indicates
  protein expression increase while blue bars indicate protein expression decrease—compared
  to the calculated proteomic baseline) was made across the stated expression level
  series (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 μg cDNA). To simplify the data analysis of this complex
  expression matrix, the mean protein expression values across the different extraction
  conditions were calculated (F). The associated heatmap key indicates the range of
  log2 transformed GPR19: mock expression ratios. These mean data were then subjected
  to signaling pathway analysis using a Kolmogorov–Smirnoff (KS) test applied to the
  MSigDB Curated Reactome Database. One of the most prominent pathways populated by
  the total cellular perturbation response (from mean expression response data in
  panel (F)) to GPR19 expression was the Reactome “Cellular Response to Stress” (G).
  The yellow inset in panel G indicates the “leading edge” set of proteins that are
  responding to the positive KS score for “Cellular Response to Stress.” Extracting
  this protein set and then analyzing it for Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP)
  enrichment analysis revealed a strong phenotype for DNA-based stress management
  (H). Histogram-based data shown represent the means ± SEM (standard error of the
  mean). The significance level is indicated in each figure as * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤
  0.01'
