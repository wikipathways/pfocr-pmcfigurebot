figure_title: Time-of-day of tissue harvest influences differential gene expression
  in APP/PS1 mice
caption: A & B. Volcano plots showing differential gene expression in microglia between
  WT and APP/PS1 mice harvested during the morning (AM) hours (A) or evening (PM)
  hours (B). 506 DEGs were identified in AM, 627 in PM. C. Comparison of fold change
  of induction of DEGs in microglia in WT vs. APP/PS1 mice harvested in AM or PM.
  Brown circles indicate more expression in PM; pink circles indicate more expression
  in AM. D & E. Genes plotted from microglia in the AM time bin (D) or PM time bin
  (E) including myeloid transcription factor Spi1, interferon-inducible protein Aim2,
  and Cd209a, known to regulate phagocytic activity. Volcano plots showing differential
  gene expression in astrocytes between WT and APP/PS1 mice harvested during the morning
  (AM) hours (F) or evening (PM) hours (G). 438 DEGs were identified in both AM and
  PM, though not the same 438. H. Comparison of fold change of induction of DEGs in
  astrocytes in WT vs. APP/PS1 mice harvested in AM or PM. Dark purple circles indicate
  more expression in PM; light purple circles indicate more expression in AM. I &
  J. Genes plotted from astrocytes in the AM time bin (I) or PM time bin (J) including,
  WNT pathway gene Wnt7a, ciliary neurotrophic factor Cntf, and AD GWAS gene, Clu
  (Clusterin). In C and H, only genes with fold change <3 were examined-all genes
  with large fold changes (>3 fold) were identified as DEGs in both AM and PM datasets.
  Graphs in (D,E,I and J) show mean ± SEM. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by unpaired two-tailed
  t test
