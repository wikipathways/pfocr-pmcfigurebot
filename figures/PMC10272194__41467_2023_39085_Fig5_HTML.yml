figure_title: EMT markers spatially overlap with high tension matrix and associate
  with poor survival in patient tumors
caption: a Pearson correlation between GSVA scores for collagen genes and hallmark
  pathway genes in the Nuvera dataset. b Scatterplot of GSVA scores for collagen genes
  and hallmark EMT genes. Each point represents one patient. N = 508 patients. Pearson
  r = 0.880. c FOVs for Twist1 staining within FFPE tumors (left). Scale bar, 50 μm.
  Inset scale bar, 10 μm. Scatterplots of STIFMap intensity vs stain intensity for
  each pixel shown in (i) indicating the 99th percentile of stain intensity for each
  STIFMap percentile (right). N = 22 imaged FOVs. d–f Violin plots of the Spearman
  correlation for each FOV comparing the 99th percentile of staining intensity versus
  percentiles of DAPI, predicted elasticity, or collagen stain intensity. Internal
  gray bars indicate a box-plot. N = 22 Twist1 FOVs, n = 5 ZEB1 FOVs, and n = 25 SLUG
  FOVs. g Representative whole slide image (WSI) and regions of interest (ROIs) of
  ZEB1 stain with STIFMap in HER2+ breast cancer cohort. Scale bar (WSI), 1 mm. Scale
  bar (ROIs), 100 μm. N = 21 patient tumor samples. h Spearman correlation for each
  whole tissue section comparing the 99th percentile of staining intensity versus
  percentiles of predicted elasticity and collagen stain intensity. N = 21 patient
  tumor samples. i Box and whiskers plots to show the association between metastatic
  recurrence and spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I) for tissue markers and STIFMaps
  in the HER2+ breast cancer cohort (n = 84 breast tumors). Kaplan–Meier curves comparing
  survival between the upper and lower quartiles of EMT (j) and collagen (k) GSVA
  scores within the Nuvera cohort. N = 127 patients in each group. Boxes denote 25th
  to 75th percentile with median line. Whiskers mark the minima and the maxima excluding
  outliers. Statistical analyses were performed using two-sided Mann–Whitney U test
  (d–f, h, i) and logrank test (j, k), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 ****P < 10−5.
