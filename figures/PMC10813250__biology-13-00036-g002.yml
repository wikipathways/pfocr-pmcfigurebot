figure_title: Red ginseng administration for 4 weeks suppresses the hepatic cellular
  senescence pathway in aged mice.
caption: 'Red ginseng administration for 4 weeks suppresses the hepatic cellular senescence
  pathway in aged mice. Distilled water was orally administered to 9-week-old (Young)
  and 19-month-old (Old) mice, and 300 mg/kg RG in distilled water was given to 19-month-old
  (Old + RG) mice (n = 6 per group) for 4 weeks. (A) Total liver tissue lysates were
  immunoblotted with cellular senescence-related markers: p53, p21, p16, and p15.
  (B,C) Primary hepatocytes were isolated from Young, Old, and Old + RG mice, followed
  by immunoblotting with (B) p15 and (C) cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-3. Ordinary
  two-way ANOVA was used for the quantification of immunoblots followed by Tukey’s
  multiple comparison tests. The data are expressed as mean ± SEM (* p < 0.05, **
  p < 0.01)'
