figure_title: Results of molecular docking analysis of small-molecule compounds found
  in the ethyl acetate extract from decoction of Sargentodoxa cuneata (EAdSc) with
  the key proteins (TLR4, NF-κB-p65, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1) of the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3
  signaling pathway.

  the ethyl acetate extract from decoction of Sargentodoxa cuneata (EAdSc) with the
  key proteins (TLR4, NF-κB-p65, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1) of the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3
  signaling pathway. The darker green color in the heatmap means that the compound
  has a strong affinity for the target, and the darker red color means that the compound
  has a weak affinity for the target
