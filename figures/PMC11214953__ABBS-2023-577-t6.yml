caption: Schematic representation of ANG expression regulation and its role in macrophagesLPS
  activates the TLR4 signaling pathway, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB
  and binding to the ANG promoter, promoting ANG gene transcription in macrophages.
  However, ANG does not significantly impact macrophage phagocytosis, chemotaxis,
  or cell survival.
