figure_title: Probiotics relieve diabetes by stimulating GLP-1 secretion.
caption: Probiotics relieve diabetes by stimulating GLP-1 secretion. Probiotics can
  affect the metabolites of intestinal flora by regulating the structure of intestinal
  flora, activating the metabolic pathway in the host body, and stimulating the secretion
  of GLP-1 by intestinal L-cells. This alleviates T2DM and enhances the antioxidant
  capacity of host cells by increasing the content of peroxide dismutase in the body,
  which helps to clear free radicals and reduce the occurrence of T2DM complications
