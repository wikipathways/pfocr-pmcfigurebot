caption: 'KMO overexpression is a key factor leading to the elevation of xanthurenic
  acid in MI. A. The level of xanthurenic acid in the different tissues of MI mice
  after 2 weeks'' CAL (n = 5). Xanthurenic acid is one of the metabolites involved
  in the tryptophan metabolic pathway and the content of xanthurenic acid in the tissues
  were quantitatively analyzed by LC-MS. B. The heart tissues of sham and MI model
  groups mice were collected for transcriptome analysis (Sham: n = 3, Model 2-3w:
  n = 6). Volcano plot and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differential genes
  between sham, model 2-3w. Red dots in volcanoes represent genes whose expression
  is up-regulated, and green dots in volcanoes represent genes whose expression is
  down-regulated. C. The expressions of KAT1 and KMO in heart tissues of sham and
  MI model groups mice, and were determined by the immunohistochemical staining (n
  = 5) (400X magnification, the lines marked in all figures represent 50 µm). D. The
  expression level of KMO in the different tissues of sham and MI model groups mice
  after 2 weeks'' CAL, and were measured by immunohistochemical staining (n = 5) (400X
  magnification, the lines marked in all figures represent 50 µm). Image J software
  was used for area statistics. E. Effects of KMO inhibitor UPF-648 on the contents
  of xanthurenic acid in urine samples of MI model groups mice after 2 weeks'' CAL
  (n = 6-7) (1 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day). F. Effects of cardiac-specific knockdown
  of KMO expression through infection of recombinant AAV-KMO on the contents of xanthurenic
  acid in urine samples of MI model groups mice after 2 weeks'' CAL (n = 6). Data
  are presented as mean ± SD. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs. sham or sham + AAV-NC group,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. model or model + AAV-NC group; ns means no significance'
