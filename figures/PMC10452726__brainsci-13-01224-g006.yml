figure_title: Differential metabolic pathways analysis between the CCI and sham groups.
caption: 'Differential metabolic pathways analysis between the CCI and sham groups.
  The differential metabolites were subjected to metabolic pathway enrichment analysis,
  with p < 0.05, VIP > 1; top 20 related metabolic pathways were analyzed. (A,C) Enrichment
  map: the red dummy line indicates a p-value of 0.01, and the blue dummy line indicates
  a p-value of 0.05. Signal pathways higher than the blue dummy line represent significant
  differences. (B,D) Bubble chart: the size of the dots represents the number of metabolites.
  RichFactor, the number of differential metabolites/total number of metabolites in
  this pathway'
