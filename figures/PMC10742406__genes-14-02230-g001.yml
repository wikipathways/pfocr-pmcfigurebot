figure_title: Metabolite accumulation of P.
caption: 'Metabolite accumulation of P. montana var. thomsonii at different growth
  stages. (a) Metabolite accumulation at different growth stages. (b) Principal component
  analysis (PCA) of metabolites in different groups. (c) KEGG analysis of all DAMs:
  the upper section represents the results of the GX1 vs. GD1 group, while the lower
  section represents the results of the GX2 vs. GD2 group. Each bubble in the plot
  represents a metabolic pathway, the abscissa and bubble size of which jointly indicate
  the magnitude of the impact factors of the pathway. A larger bubble size indicates
  a larger impact factor. The abscissa of bubbles indicates the enrichment ratio of
  metabolites in each pathway. The bubble colors represent the p-value of the enrichment
  analysis, with lighter colors showing a higher confidence level. Sorted by the p-value,
  the top 20 metabolic pathways are plotted in the bubble chart'
