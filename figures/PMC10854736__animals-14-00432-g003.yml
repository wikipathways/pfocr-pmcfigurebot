caption: Comparison of the significantly different bacterial genera and functions
  in the feces of juvenile sika deer among the different age groups. (a) The bar plot
  shows the significantly different bacterial genera in the feces of juvenile sika
  deer among the different age groups using the LEfSe based on the KW test (LDA >
  4, p < 0.05). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. (b) The PCoA shows the difference in the
  bacterial functional profiles at KEGG level 3 (relative abundances) based on the
  Brayâ€“Curits dissimilarity. (c) Heatmap showing the significantly changed pathways
  at KEGG level 3 among the different age groups (LDA > 2, p < 0.05)
