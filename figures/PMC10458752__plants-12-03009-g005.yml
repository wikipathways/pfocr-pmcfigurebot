figure_title: Differential flavonoid metabolites were identified in the flag leaves
  of RD2.
caption: Differential flavonoid metabolites were identified in the flag leaves of
  RD2. (A) The simplified schematic representation of the tight relationships between
  photosynthesis and the biosynthetic pathways of flavonoids. Photosynthetic light
  reactions provide NADPH and ATP consumed in flavonoid biosynthesis, and photosynthetic
  dark reactions (Calvinâ€“Benson cycle) supply the triose-P (GA3P/DHAP) as the primary
  carbon skeleton substrates in the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids. DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate
  7-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; F, phenylalanine;
  GA3PD, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Y, tyrosine. (B) The
  differential flavonoid metabolites identified using LC-MS in the flag leaves of
  RD2 in comparison with WT are represented as the cluster heatmap. Fold changes are
  visualized using a color gradient from red (high) to blue (low). Ten biological
  replicates, taken from the flag leaves of 10 groups of plants of WT and transgenic
  rice line RD2, are shown
