  Jurkat cells.
caption: 'Necroptosis up-regulates CD3D via the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway in Jurkat
  cells. (A) The correlation analysis of CD3D expression with necroptosis level. (B)
  The expressing amount of CD3D differed in the untreated control group and necroptosis
  inducer treated group with a p-value <0.01(**). (C) The protein level of CD3D is
  much stronger with the induction of necroptosis and showed an increasing trend with
  the increase of dose. (D, F) Treated with NSA, Jurkat cells exhibited a lower level
  of CD3D evaluated by RT-qPCR, with p-value <0.0001(****) (D) and WB (F). (E, G)
  Treated with Nec-1, Jurkat cells exhibited a lower level of CD3D evaluated by RT-qPCR,
  with p-value <0.01(**) (E) and WB (G). (H) GSEA analysis revealed that the high
  necroptosis group was enriched in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. (I) The protein
  level of JAK2, STAT3 and p-STAT3 is much stronger with the induction of necroptosis.
  (J, K) The protein level of JAK2, STAT3 and p-STAT3 exhibits to decrease in the
  condition of NSA (J) or Nec-1 (K). (L) The protein level of JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3
  and CD3D was much stronger with the induction of necroptosis and this effect was
  eliminated by FLLL32. (M) RT-qPCR results show CD3D was up-regulated by necroptosis
  and this effect was inhibited by FLLL32 at a concentration of 10 µm (p-Value: ***
  p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p <0.05, ns p > 0.05). (N) RT-qPCR showed the down-regulation
  of PD-1, TIGIT, CTLA4, TIM3, LAG3 and VISTA in the condition of TNFɑ + Z-VAD-FMK
  and this effect was inhibited by FLLL32 (p-Value: **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001,
  ** p < 0.01, * p <0.05, ns p > 0.05). (O) RT-qPCR showed the up-regulation of CCR4,
  CCR5, CCR7 and CCR9 with the treatment of TNFɑ + Z-VAD-FMK and this effect was eliminated
  by FLLL32 (p-Value: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p <0.05, ns p > 0.05)'
