caption: The mTORC1/2 signaling pathways. The receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)/PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway, stimulated by growth factors, is pivotal to mTOR protein regulation.
  PI3K, typically maintained at a basal level, is activated to synthesize phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). This
  process is counteracted by the tumor suppressor PTEN. PIP2 and PIP3 trigger AKT
  phosphorylation, leading to TSC2 inactivation and Rheb-GTP generation. Upon phosphorylation
  by mTORC1, ULK1/2 induces autophagy by phosphorylating Beclin-1
