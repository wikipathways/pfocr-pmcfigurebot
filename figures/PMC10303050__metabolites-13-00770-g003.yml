caption: Heat map of metabolites profile involved in (A) pentose phosphate pathway
  and (B) tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in leaves of Scotia tomato seedlings treated
  with pyroligneous acid (PA) under aluminum (Al) stress. Metabolite concentrations
  in every compartment are normalized across all data for an individual compound such
  that similar colour intensities between compounds can represent widely differing
  concentrations. The red colour represents a lower concentration, and the green colour
  represents a higher concentration of a particular metabolite
