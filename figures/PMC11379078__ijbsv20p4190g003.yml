figure_title: UA inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma progression by disturbing the
  ING5-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
caption: UA inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma progression by disturbing the ING5-mediated
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (A) The correlations between ING5 mRNA and Akt or PIK3CA
  mRNA were analyzed using the ggplot2 library in R software. (B) PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway related proteins in ING5-overexpressing or -silencing HepG2 cells were screened
  by western blot. (C) Co-IP was performed to assess the interaction between ING5
  and PI3K/Akt. HepG2 cells overexpressing ING5 were treated with 10 μM LY294002 for
  24 h, and cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were measured by CCK-8
  (D), Annexin V staining (E) (n=3), wound healing (F) (n=5), and Transwell assays
  (G) (n=3), respectively. (H) Western blot assays were performed to determine the
  expression of proteins related to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and phenotype-related
  proteins after ING5-overexpressing HepG2 cells with 10μM LY294002 treatment for
  24 h. (I) Western blot analyses were performed to confirm that treatment with 5
  μM UA attenuated the ING5-induced changes in the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt,
  and the expressions of phenotype-related proteins in HepG2 cells. All data are presented
  as mean ± SD, and Student's t test was used for significance tests, *P < 0.05, **P
  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Scale bar = 50μm. UA, ursolic acid. IP, immunoprecipitation
