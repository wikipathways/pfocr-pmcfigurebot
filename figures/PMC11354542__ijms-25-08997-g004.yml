caption: 'Neurotrophin-signaling pathways in the low-intensity exercise group (coral:
  upregulation; blue: downregulation). The CHK gene was upregulated, and the NF-ÎºB
  gene was downregulated with low-intensity treadmill exercise. The neurotrophin-signaling
  pathway was elicited with the KEGG Mapper Search and Color Pathway tool (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html,
  accessed on 19 December 2020)'
