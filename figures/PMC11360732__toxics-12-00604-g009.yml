caption: Enrichment analysis highlighting the significantly altered metabolic pathways
  in the fentanyl overdose group. The analysis was performed to identify which metabolic
  pathways were significantly impacted due to the fentanyl overdose. Each bar represents
  a different metabolic pathway, with the length of the bar corresponding to the degree
  of enrichment, measured by the enrichment score. The color of the bars indicates
  the statistical significance of the enrichment, with darker colors representing
  lower p-values (higher significance). Pathways shown include those involved in energy
  metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, inflammation processes,
  and others. The x-axis denotes the enrichment score, while the y-axis lists the
  specific metabolic pathways. Notably, pathways such as lactose/galactose metabolism,
  sphingolipid metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis are significantly enriched,
  indicating a strong metabolic response to fentanyl toxicity
