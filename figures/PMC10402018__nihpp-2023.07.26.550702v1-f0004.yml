figure_title: Pharmacological inhibition of the Raf1 pathway does not impact fibroblast
  cell counts.
caption: Pharmacological inhibition of the Raf1 pathway does not impact fibroblast
  cell counts. (A-B) MRC5 or (C-D) HFF fibroblasts were treated with indicated concentration
  of (A, C) Regorafenib or (B, D) Sorafenib at time of infection, AD169-GFP, MOI =
  0.1, fixed on Day 5. (A-D) Using the Cytation and Gen5 software, Floechst-stained
  nuclei were counted and plotted against concentration (avgÂ±SEM, n=3). Solid gray
  line indicates average number of nuclei in untreated HCMV infected cells and dotted
  gray line indicates average number of nuclei in untreated mock infected cells
article_title: Raf1 promotes successful Human Cytomegalovirus replication and is regulated
  by AMPK-mediated phosphorylation during infection
