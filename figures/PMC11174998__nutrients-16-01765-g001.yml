figure_title: Overview of one-carbon metabolism.
caption: 'Overview of one-carbon metabolism. OCM-related metabolites are indicated
  by rectangular boxes, with the folate cycle in green, the choline metabolic pathway
  in blue, the methionine cycle in red, and the transsulfuration pathway in yellow.
  Other vitamins are shown in orange, and amino acids and others are shown in purple.
  The filled rectangular boxes indicate OCM-related metabolites measured in this study.
  Each arrow represents a biochemical reaction, and the dotted rectangle on the arrow
  is labeled with the first letter of the enzyme catalyzing the reaction. Abbreviations:
  5-MTHF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; B12, cobalamin/methylcobalamin; B2, riboflavin;
  B6, pyridoxal phosphate (pyridoxine/pyridoxal/pyridoxamine); BAD, betaine aldehyde
  dehydrogenase; BHMT, betaine–homocysteine methyltransferase; CBS, cystationine-β
  synthase; CHD, choline dehydrogenase; CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase; Cys, cysteine;
  DMG, dimethylglycine; FA, folic acid; Hcy, homocysteine; MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase;
  MS, methionine synthase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTRR, methionine
  synthase reductase; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAHH, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase;
  SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
