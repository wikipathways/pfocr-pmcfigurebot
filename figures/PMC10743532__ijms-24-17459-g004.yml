  the NF-κB and ERK pathways.
caption: WGA-M001 regulated OA-related molecules through dephosphorylation in the
  NF-κB and ERK pathways. For in silico analysis, 200 μg/mL of Tagetes erecta, Ocimum
  basilicum, or WGA-M001 was used for treatment of chondrocytes for 12 h along with
  IL-1β (1 ng/mL), and RNA sequencing was performed. (A) In each signaling pathway,
  the number of genes upregulated by IL-1β and then downregulated by T. erecta, O.
  basilicum, or WGA-M001 was shown. (B,C) Protein levels of pp38, p38, pJNK, JNK,
  pERK, ERK, pp65, p65, and IκB were detected by Western blot analysis and relative
  intensities were quantified by densitometry (n = 5). Each protein level was normalized
  to ERK. Data are represented as mean ± SD as results of analysis by one-way ANOVA
  with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test (n = 5). * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001, and
  n.s = not significant
