figure_title: FARSB activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by suppressing Raptor phosphorylation.
caption: 'FARSB activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by suppressing Raptor phosphorylation.
  (A) Using the TCGA-LIHC dataset, GSEA performed Kegg enrichment analysis, and the
  mTOR signaling pathway was significantly enriched in the FARSB overexpression group.
  (B) Western blot detected the activation level of mTORC1 after FARSB knockdown.
  (C) MHCC97H cells were treated with rapamycin at a gradient concentration for 24
  h, and Western blot detected the expression level of FARSB and the activation level
  of mTORC1. (D) MHCC97H cells overexpressing FARSB and the control group were treated
  with 20 nM rapamycin for 48 h, and Western blot detected the activation level of
  mTORC1. (E,F) Co-immunoprecipitation assay (E) and immunofluorescence co-localization
  (F) confirmed the endogenous (MHCC97H) interaction between FARSB and Raptor. (G)
  Western blot detected the changes in the phosphorylation level of Raptor after knockdown
  or overexpression of FARSB. **: p < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001'
