caption: Optimal duration of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis on glass, bone, and
  dentin substrates (4 days). (A) Light microscopy and TRAP staining recorded the
  differentiation of osteoclasts derived from RAW 264.7 macrophages cultured on glass
  from Day 2 to Day 5. TRAP-positive cells with more than three nuclei were classified
  as mature osteoclasts. Scale bar = 100 μm. The arrows indicated the process from
  osteoclastogenesis to apoptosis. (B) Macroscopic images of TRAP-stained osteoclasts
  in a 48-well plate. (C) Quantitative analysis showed that TRAP-positive areas peaked
  on Day 4, with a significant increase from Day 3, followed by a decline on Day 5
  (** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001). (D) Principal component analysis (PCA) identified
  distinct variance patterns among osteoclasts on glass, bone, and dentin substrates,
  as well as RAW 264.7 macrophages. (E) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated
  a significant upregulation of osteoclast differentiation genes across all substrates
  by Day 4 compared to that of RAW 264.7 macrophages. (F) Hierarchical clustering
  heat maps and temporal density plots illustrated the gene expression profiles associated
  with the NF-κB signaling pathway in osteoclasts across the three substrates by Day
  4
