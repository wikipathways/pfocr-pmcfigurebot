  in regulating lipid metabolism through STAT3.
caption: Transcriptomic data reveal key signaling pathways influenced by Thr in regulating
  lipid metabolism through STAT3. (A) PCA of RNA-seq data after treatment with siRNA-NC
  and siRNA-STAT3. (B) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes. (C) Volcano plot
  of differentially expressed genes. (D) Enrichment plot of the top twenty KEGG pathways
  for differentially expressed genes. (E) Overlapping genes between different Thr
  levels of RNA-seq and siSTAT3 RNA-seq data. (F) KEGG enrichment of overlapping genes.
  (G) Regulatory network between overlapping genes (different colored circles) and
  STAT3, the green line represents gene neighborhood, red line represents gene fusions,
  blue represents gene co-occurrence, yellow line represents text mining, black line
  represents co-expression, lavender line represents protein homology, cyan line represents
  curated databases, and magenta represents experimentally determined relationships
