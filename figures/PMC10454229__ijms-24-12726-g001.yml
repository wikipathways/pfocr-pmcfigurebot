figure_title: Metabolomics analysis of B.
caption: Metabolomics analysis of B. plicatilis exposed to BDE-47 for 24 h. (A) Volcano
  plots of different metabolites between low (0.02 mg/L, L), medium (0.1 mg/L, M),
  high (0.5 mg/L, H) concentration group, and control group (C). The blue dots represent
  significantly down-regulated metabolites (FC < 0.5, p < 0.05); the red dots represent
  significantly up-regulated metabolites (FC > 2, p < 0.05). (B) PCA score plots of
  each treatment group, control group, and quality control group. (C) Differential
  metabolic pathways enrichment analysis between each treatment group and control
  group. The metabolic pathways are displayed as distinctly colored circles depending
  on their enrichment analyses scores (vertical axis, shade of red) and topology (pathway
  impact, horizontal axis, circle diameter)
