figure_title: Correlation between metabolites enriched into metabolic pathways and
  TOP15 microbiota.
caption: Correlation between metabolites enriched into metabolic pathways and TOP15
  microbiota. Spearman’s level correlation between cecum microflora and metabolites.
  Correlation analysis between abomasum dominant microbials and differential metabolites
  in (A) 15% FDG-A vs. BD-A, (B) 30% FDG-A vs. BD-A and (C) 30% FDG-A vs. 15% FDG-A.
  Correlation analysis between cecum dominant microbials and differential metabolites
  in (D) 15% FDG-C vs. BD-C and (E) 30% FDG-C vs. 15% FDG-A. In the figure, red and
  blue colors represent positive and negative correlations, respectively, and color
  gradation indicates the size of the correlation coefficient. * p < 0.05, ** p <
  0.01, and *** p < 0.001 indicate significant differences between the microbiota
  and metabolites
