caption: SRI inhibits cells apoptosis through the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A,B) Tumor
  volume and weight of orthotopic xenograft models derived from upSRI cells treated
  with Stattic. Symbols of different colors represented the weight of tumors in different
  groups. (C,D) Representative IHC images of STAT3, p65, p-p65, p-IκB and apoptosis-related
  proteins in Stattic treatment. Scale bars = 50 μm. (C,E) Representative IHC images
  of p65 and apoptosis-related proteins after treatment with AL inhibitor. The expression
  of proteins were determined by the brown area. (F–H) AL inhibits the fluorescence
  intensity of TMRE (shown in red) and reduced the sensitivities to SRI-induced apoptosis
  by Hoechst 33342 (shown in blue) staining assay. Scale bars = 200 μm. (I–L) Apoptosis-related
  proteins were detected after treated with AL inhibitor by Western blot. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.01
