caption: ACAT1 was highly expressed in BLCA patients and was associated with high
  pathological grade and poor clinical prognosis. (A-B) Analysis of ATAC1 mRNA expression
  in BLCA unpaired (A) / paired (B) samples based on TCGA database. (C) Correlation
  between ATAC1 expression levels and BLCA pathological grade. (D) qRT-PCR analysis
  of the expression of PPARγ mRNA in BLCA (n = 10) and matched paracancerous tissues
  (n = 10). (E-F) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of BLCA patients based on TCGA database,
  overall survival (E) and disease-free survival (F). (G-J) GSEA emphasized the correlation
  between increased ACAT1 expression and pathways in cancer (G), cell adhesion molecules
  cams (H), oxidative phosphorylation (I), and cell cycle (J)
