figure_title: Mel ameliorated hepatic ferroptosis by inhibiting ER stress through
  the MT2/cAMP/PKA/IRE1 signaling pathway.
caption: 'Mel ameliorated hepatic ferroptosis by inhibiting ER stress through the
  MT2/cAMP/PKA/IRE1 signaling pathway. (A) Immunofluorescence analysis of GPX4 in
  HepG2 cells treated with Erastin, H-89, 4μ8C, Mel, or dbcAMP (scale: 50 μm). (B-F)
  Relative protein levels of GPX4, NRF2, FPN, TFR1, and DMT1 in HepG2 cells (n = 5).
  The results are presented as the mean ± SEM. Differences were assessed by one-way
  ANOVA. Values without the same superscript letter were significantly different (p
  < 0.05); those with the same letter do not differ significantly (p ≥ 0.05)'
