caption: F3 activates NF-κB signaling pathway in hypoxic GBM cells. (A) Relative expression
  level of up-regulated genes in OE-F3-LN229 RNA-seq data validated by RT-qPCR. (B)
  Relative expression level of down-regulated genes in this RNA-seq data validated
  by RT-qPCR. (C) Relative expression level of genes enriched in NF-κB signaling pathway
  in this RNA-seq data validated by RT-qPCR. (D) Representative images of Western
  Blot show protein levels of F3, NF-κB p65, phospho-NF-κB p65 and Bcl-2 in hypoxic
  OE-F3-LN229 (left) and OE-F3-U87 (right) cells. (E-G) Correlation analysis of F3
  and NF-κB downstream genes (E) CARD16, (F) F2RL1 and (G) APOL3 in GEPIA online database
  based on TCGA GBM dataset. Data were analyzed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
  Data are shown as mean ± SEM (error bars) and were analyzed using ANOVA test (A-C)
