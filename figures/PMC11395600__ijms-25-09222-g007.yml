caption: 'Hierarchical cluster analysis and metabolic pathway statistics. (A) In the
  hierarchical cluster figure, the left side panel is a hierarchical clustering tree,
  where the samples are clustered based on their resemblance, and the smaller the
  branch length among the samples, the more identical the two samples are. On the
  right panel (plotted by default) is a stacked histogram of the 10 most prevalent
  genera. CK: control. S1: WT Kp138. S2: ∆Kp138. S3: WT KpC4. S4: ∆KpC4. S5: WT KpE4.
  S6: ∆KpE4. (B) Klebsiella pneumoniae impacts metabolic pathways within gut bacterial
  communities. Functional secondary classifications from the KEGG database are categorized
  at the genus level. The lowest column in the table is the abundance or count of
  the first-level pathway/classification, the second column is the second-level pathway/classification,
  and the third column is the functional pathway/classification'
