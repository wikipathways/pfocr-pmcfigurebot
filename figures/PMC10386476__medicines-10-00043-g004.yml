figure_title: Prediction of the estrogen-related receptor with PPARγ coactivator antagonist
  activities (ERRPGC_ant) of Compounds A and B by Toxicity Predictor.
caption: 'Prediction of the estrogen-related receptor with PPARγ coactivator antagonist
  activities (ERRPGC_ant) of Compounds A and B by Toxicity Predictor. In silico study
  suggests the inhibition of Compound A against the estrogen-related receptor-alpha
  signaling pathway, which is identified as an adverse marker for breast cancer progression
  and poor prognosis. Data on CC50 and TSM values were derived from a previous study
  [14]. Tumor selectivity is defined by the balance between pCC50 values for normal
  (N) and tumor (T) cells. The difference (T − N) was used as a tumor-selectivity
  index only for this analysis. When pCC50 is defined as −log (CC50), T-S can be calculated
  as: pCC50 (T) − pCC50 (N) = log CC50 (N) − log CC50 (T) = log (CC50 (N)) − log (CC50
  (T)) = log CC50 (N/T). Box and whisker plots were depicted with red lines. The central
  box represents the values from the lower to upper quartile. The middle line inside
  the box represents the median. The whiskers show the range of the data'
