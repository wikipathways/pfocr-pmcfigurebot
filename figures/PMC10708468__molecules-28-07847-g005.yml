  was evaluated by western blot analysis.
caption: The protein expression of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling pathway of 4 was evaluated
  by western blot analysis. A549 cells were treated with 4 (0.2 and 0.4 μM) for 24
  h, and the expression levels of PI3K, Akt and mTOR were tested by the responsible
  antibodies. Compound 4 inhibited the expression of PI3K, Akt and mTOR after treatment.
