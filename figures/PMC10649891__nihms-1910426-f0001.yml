  (A–C) Cd4cre
  Cd137fl/fl (Cd137−/−) and Cd137fl/fl (Cd137+/+) were injected s.c. with MC38 or B16K1 cells. (A) Tumor area. (B) Frequency and number of CD8+ T cells. (C) Expression of the indicated markers by CD8+ T cells.(D–J) Cd4creCd137fl/flROSA26tomato and Cd137fl/flROSA26tomato mixed BM chimeras were injected s.c. with B16K1 cells. Cd137−/− (tomato+) and Cd137+/+ (tomato−) spleen and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) after 21 days. (n = 7 pooled mice/group.) (D) Ratio of CD137+/+ vs. CD137−/−(CD137WT/KO) spleen and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. (E) Spleen and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells transcriptomic landscape scattered in 6 clusters. (F and G) Relative expression of the indicated genes (F) and signatures (G).(H and I) UMAP (H) and graphs (I) showing cluster frequency in the indicated samples.(J) Fold change in expression and adjusted p value of relevant pathways enriched in Cd137+/+ vs. Cd137−/− tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells.(K) Expression of CD137 by the indicated spleen or B16K1-tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cell subsets after 19 days.(L) CD137WT/KO ratio in the indicated CD8+ T cell subsets from B16K1 bearing mixed BM chimeras as in (D). Data are presented as mean ± SEM from at least 2 independent experiments. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 (Mann-Whitney test or ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test analysis)
