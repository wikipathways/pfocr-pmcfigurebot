figure_title: Dysregulated alternative splicing related genes in COVID-19 patients
caption: (A) Principal component analysis of gene expression levels from 190 samples.
  (B) Results of the top 10 pathways enriched with the 7,529 DEGs. (C) Heatmap of
  92 DEGs involved in RNA splicing (GO:0008380). Z-score indicate relative gene expression
  levels. Hierarchical clustering of DEGs was performed with Euclidean distance matrix
  of relative gene expression levels. (D) Protein-protein network of significant DEGs
  related to RNA splicing. The color of each gene indicates statistically significant
  and fold change to HC. (E) Gene expression levels of six hub genes which are depressed
  in COVID-19 patients. The error bar indicates standard deviation of the mean
