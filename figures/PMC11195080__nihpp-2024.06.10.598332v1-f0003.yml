  Proteomics Analysis
caption: Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in STRING , for upregulated (panel
  a) and downregulated (panel b) proteins. Genes highlighted in red are linked with
  the upregulated protein networks, while genes in blue, gray, and purple correspond
  to those in the downregulated protein network. The visual network in STRING illustrates
  protein interactions. In evidence mode, color in the network represents the interaction
  evidence of data support, derived from curated databases, experimental data, gene
  neighborhood, gene fusions, co-occurrence, co-expression, protein homology, and
  text mining ,.
