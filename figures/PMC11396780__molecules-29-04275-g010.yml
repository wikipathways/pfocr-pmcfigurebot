caption: The qRT-PCR-based analysis was conducted to assess the expression levels
  of 12 selected unigenes. (A) Genes involved in the PI3K-AKT pathway. (B) Genes involved
  in the MAPK pathway. (C) Genes involved in the P53 pathway. (D) Genes involved in
  the central carbon metabolism in cancer. *, **, *** and **** represent significant
  p-values â‰¤ 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, respectively
