figure_title: Proximal and distal enhancers regulate Dnmt3b induction
caption: '(A) qRT-PCR of Dnmt3b during 2i-ESC differentiation as illustrated. The
  threshold cycle (Ct) values were normalized to Gapdh, and expression is shown relative
  to that in UD cells.(B) RT-PCR expression analysis in 2i-ESCs of Dnmt3b1 and Dnmt3b6
  amplified in the same reaction mix by using primers flanking the AS exons. The illustration
  shows AS exons 22 and 23, and red arrows represent the primer’s position to amplify
  around the AS exons of the Dnmt3b gene.(C–G) Chromatin conformation capture (3C)
  assay shows an interaction of the distal enhancer (DE) with the region around the
  promoter of Dnmt3b. The illustration shows the arbitrary location of the DE and
  promoter (Pro) in the Dnmt3b locus. The 3C PCR primers (arrows) at the corresponding
  HaeIII sites are shown. Interaction frequency was calculated by qPCR analysis using
  the primer (green arrow) at the DE as an anchor (chromosome 2 [Chr2] position: 153,466,046).
  Plotted is the relative interaction frequency in arbitrary units of the Dnmt3b DE
  with regions around the six HaeIII sites. The x axis represents the Chr2 location
  (153,465,120–153,477,120) of these HaeIII sites.(D–G) Chromatin immunoprecipitation
  (ChIP)-qPCR shows fold enrichment over input. Histone modifications at Dnmt3b regulatory
  elements (D) H3K4me1, (E) H3K27Ac, and (F and G) H3K27me3 in 2i-ESCs pre- and post-differentiation.
  Results are presented as normalized mean values ± SEM for n ≥3. p values were derived
  using the ANOVA test: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.005. ****p < 0.0001.(H) Bisulfite
  sequencing shows the percentage of CpG methylation at Dnmt3b regulatory elements
  in wild-type and Dnmt3a−/− cells. Bisulfite-treated DNA from wild-type and Dnmt3a−/−
  cells was sequenced using a high-throughput sequencing platform (Wide-seq), and
  Bismark software was used to analyze the data. The boxplot represents the range
  of the percentage of DNA methylation at various CpG sites in each target region.
  The median methylation at both targets is higher in KD cells compared with vector
  control (VC) cells. p values were calculated using Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank test:
  *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.005. See also Figure S1.UD, undifferentiated; D1–D6,
