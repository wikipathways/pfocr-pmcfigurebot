caption: H2O2 generated by TGF-β1 stimulation promotes phosphorylation of Syk, PI3K
  p85α, and Akt. (A) HeLa cells were treated with DPI (10 μM, 6 h) or NAC (5 mM, 6
  h), and the phosphorylation of Syk, PI3K p85α and Akt in response to TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml,
  30 min) was detected by western blot. (B) AQP3-49-shRNA HeLa cells were treated
  with 200 μM H2O2 and TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) alone or in combination for 30 min. Western
  blot analysis was then performed. (C) Western blot was used to analyze the expression
  changes of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway proteins in AQP3-49-shRNA HeLa cells treated
  with IGF-1 (100 ng/ml). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Data were presented
  as mean ± SD. *, P < 0.05, **, P < 0.01, ***, P < 0.001
