figure_title: Gene expression differences between dauer larvae induced to arrest development
  by different stimuli
caption: A limited number of gene expression pathways that regulate specific morphological
  features, and specific stress, immune, detoxification and metabolic programs vary
  between the different dauer larvae. These are summarized here
