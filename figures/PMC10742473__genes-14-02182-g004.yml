caption: Canonical and alternative signaling pathways in B-cells. The canonical B-cell
  receptor signaling pathway is shown (left) highlighting BTK (blue) and BTK inhibitors
  (BTKi—Orange). BTKi resistance alternative signaling pathways are shown (right)
  highlighting alternative signaling from activating mutations in PLCG2 (green), mutations
  in NFkB (orange), signaling through activation of cell surface receptor CD19 (yellow),
  epigenetic signaling described from RAC2 activation (blue), or proposed noncatalytic
  signaling of kinase dead mutated BTK through HCK activation (purple)
