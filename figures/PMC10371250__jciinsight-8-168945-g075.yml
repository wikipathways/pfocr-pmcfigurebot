figure_title: cGAS/STING signaling pathway is activated in the retina of diabetic
  mice
caption: 'Representative immunoblots (A) and densitometry graphs show that the protein
  levels of (B) cGAS and (C) STING expression was increased in the retina of diabetic
  (D) mice (diabetes induction for 2 months) compared with nondiabetic (N) controls.
  Immunofluorescence study shows that (D) STING is localized in the retinal nerve
  fiber layer (asterisk) of both nondiabetic and diabetic mice, and more were observed
  in retinal endothelial cells in diabetic retina. Red, STING+ cells; green, CD31+
  endothelial cells. Scale bar: 50 μm. ELISA shows that (E) IFN-α (not significant)
  and (F) IFN-β (significant) were increased in the diabetic retina compared with
  nondiabetic controls, which is correlated with pericytes loss (G and H; arrowheads
  indicate pericytes). (I) Flat-mount micrographs from WT diabetic mice (2 months
  of diabetes, 4 months of age) and age-matched nondiabetic (N) controls showing blood
  vessel hyperpermeability; arrows indicate leakage sites. Scale bars: 50 μm. (J)
  Quantification of FITC-BSA leakage into the retina. Representative immunoblots (K)
  show increased inflammatory factors iNOS (L) and ICAM-1 (M) and superoxide production
  (N) in diabetic mice. In A–N, n = 6 for each group. Data are expressed as mean ±
  SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 versus nondiabetic controls by unpaired,
  2-tailed Student’s t test'
