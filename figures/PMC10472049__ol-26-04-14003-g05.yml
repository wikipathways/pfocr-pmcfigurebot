figure_title: Partial reversal of RRM2 knockdown effect by β-catenin overexpression
  in lung adenocarcinoma cells.
caption: 'Partial reversal of RRM2 knockdown effect by β-catenin overexpression in
  lung adenocarcinoma cells. (A) Detection of β-catenin expression levels using reverse
  transcription-quantitative PCR. (B) Expression levels of related proteins in the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway after β-catenin overexpression in cells with simultaneous
  RRM2 knockdown. Promotion of (C) cell proliferation and (D) colony formation by
  β-catenin overexpression in cells with simultaneous RRM2 knockdown. (E) Reduction
  of cells blocked in S-phase after β-catenin overexpression. (F) Promotion of cell
  migration by β-catenin overexpression in cells with simultaneous RRM2 knockdown
  (magnification, ×200×). (G) Attenuation of cell sensitivity to cisplatin by β-catenin
  overexpression in cells with simultaneous RRM2 knockdown. (H) Inhibition of apoptosis
  by β-catenin overexpression in cells with simultaneous RRM2 knockdown, reducing
  the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on the cells. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs.
  NC; #P<0.05 vs. NC + DDP. RRM2, ribonucleotide reductase M2; shRRM2, short hairpin
  RNA targeting RRM2; NC, negative control; OD, optical density'
