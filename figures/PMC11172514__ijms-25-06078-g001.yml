caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanism regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  in canonical, non-canonical, and alternate pathway. Optimal activation of NLRP3
  requires two steps. The first step is priming, which is initiated by extracellular
  PAMPs and endogenous cytokines by the PRRs, which then upregulates the NF-κB-mediated
  transcription of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18. The second step is activation,
  which includes canonical and non-canonical pathways. The canonical pathway is triggered
  by multiple pathogens and inflammatory agents through a combination of important
  and related events such as activation of the purinergic receptor P2X7 by ATP, cathepsin
  release following lysozyme rupture, opening of Ca2+ channels to allow ion flux,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS formation, Golgi apparatus disassembly, and endoplasmic
  reticulum stress. Once activated, oligomerization of the NLRP3 inflammasome is thought
  to induce conformational changes that generate active caspase-1, which converts
  pro-pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to mature bioactive IL-1β and IL-18. Additionally, Casp1
  cleaves the protein gasdermin D to generate N-terminal gasdermin D to form pores,
  allowing IL-1β and IL-18 to leave the cell and effectively execute a highly inflammatory
  form of cell death that is termed pyroptosis. In the non-canonical pathway, intracellular
  LPS is directly recognized by the CARD domain of caspase-11 in mice and caspase-4/5
  in humans, ultimately leading to IL-1β and IL-18 release through the activation
  of the NLRP3-ASC-Casp1 pathway. The alternative pathway of activation is caused
  by TLR4 agonists like LPS, which activates the TLR4-TRIF-RIPK1-FADD-Casp8 signaling
  pathway. Casp8 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome but lacks ASC speck formation, pyroptosis
  induction, or K+ efflux
