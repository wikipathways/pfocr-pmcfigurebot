figure_title: Effects of HBO on the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
caption: Effects of HBO on the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. TOP/FOP promoter
  assay was tested to determine Wnt signaling pathway activity. There was decreased
  TOP flash activity following HBO stimulation (** p < 0.01), whereas the FOP flash
  activity was not affected (p > 0.05). HBO treatment decreased the expression of
  Wnt3a, which suppressed β-catenin–TCF transcriptional activity
