caption: Schematic representation of molecular pathways hypothesized to be involved
  in the pathogenesis of nonspecific orbital inflammation. Nonspecific orbital inflammation
  (NSOI) is known to be induced by dysregulation in the immune system, which is outlined
  in this figure. NSOI-induced dysregulations are represented in bold red and with
  red arrows. The figure was partly generated using Servier Medical Art provided by
