figure_title: Response to signaling pathway perturbations
caption: (A) Change in TF reporter activities upon signaling pathway perturbations.
  Shown are only the responses of the direct targets of the perturbations. Activating
  perturbations are shown in blue, repressing conditions in purple. Conditions that
  were selected as best perturbation condition for the TF (i.e., strongest average
  response of the tested perturbations for that TF, see Methods) are denoted by an
  asterisk. TFs highlighted in the text are indicated in bold. TFs depicted in B-G
  are indicated by letter. LIF = leukemia inhibitory factor. PMA = phorbol 12-myristate
  13-acetate, HQ = hydroquinone, CDCA = chenodeoxycholic acid. (B-G) Response of reporters
  of six different TFs to TF-targeted pathway perturbation conditions. TFs for which
  reporters are displayed is denoted on top of each figure. Reporter activities (log2)
  in the basal condition are displayed on the x-axis and in the perturbation condition
  on the y-axis. Reporter design features are indicated by color, published reporters
  by shape
