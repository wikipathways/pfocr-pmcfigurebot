figure_title: Lumbrokinase induced cellular apoptosis and inhibited proliferation
  and metastasis in NSCLC cells.
caption: Lumbrokinase induced cellular apoptosis and inhibited proliferation and metastasis
  in NSCLC cells. (A) H460, H1299, A549, and HFL1 cells were treated with different
  concentrations of lumbrokinase for 48 h, and then the cell viability was tested
  by MTT assay. IC50 values were calculated by CVXPT32. (B) The colony formation assay
  of H460 and H1299 cells treated with lumbrokinase was detected. (C) H460 and H1299
  cells were treated with two doses of lumbrokinase for 48 h, and the expressions
  of the key proteins in the MAPK/Erk signaling pathway were detected by Western blot.
  (D) The expressions of the key proteins in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway were detected
  in H460 and H1299 cells with lumbrokinase treatment by Western blot. (E) The apoptosis-related
  proteins were detected by Western blot in H460 and H1299 cells treated with lumbrokinase.
  (F) FC analysis was used to detect cell apoptosis in H460 and H1299 cells treated
  with lumbrokinase for 48 h. The percentage of apoptotic cells was further calculated.
  (G) Wound-healing assay of H1299 and A549 cells treated with two doses of lumbrokinase
  for 12 and 24 h was detected (magnification 40×). The cell migration rate was calculated
  through the quantification of migration distance. (H) The invasive capacity of H460
  and H1299 cells treated with two doses of lumbrokinase for 48 h was analyzed by
  transwell assay. The invaded cells were stained with crystal violet and the representative
  images were taken with an inverted microscope (magnification 40×). (I) The EMT-related
  proteins were detected by Western blot in H460 and H1299 cells treated with lumbrokinase.
  The data are presented as the mean ± SD. The level of significance was indicated
  by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001, and ns means no statistical significance
