caption: 'Schematic representation of various mechanisms that have been reported to
  regulate epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in SACC patients. Five distinct
  regulatory mechanisms have been identified, including hypoxia, the activation of
  growth factors and developmental pathways (such as the transforming growth factor
  ß (TGF-ß) and Wnt signaling pathway), interaction between cancer-associated fibroblasts
  and adjacent tumor cells, and genomic or epigenomic alterations (such as MYB-NFIB
  fusion, p53 mutation, and microRNA (miR) expression). These factors play a significant
  role in the modulation of the epithelial–mesenchymal spectrum. VEGF: vascular endothelial
  growth factor; EGF: epidermal growth factor; FGF: fibroblast growth factor; PDGF:
  platelet-derived growth factor; HGF: hepatocyte growth factor; RTK: receptor tyrosine
  kinase; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; GSK3β: glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta;
  CK1a: casein kinase 1a; APC: adenomatous polyposis coli; LEF: lymphoid enhancer-binding
  factor; TCF: T cell factors; HIF1α: hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha. (Figure created
