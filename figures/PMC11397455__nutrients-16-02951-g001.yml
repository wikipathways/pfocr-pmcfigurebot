  formulae and breast milk.
caption: Transcriptome profiles of intestine organoids feeding by different infant
  formulae and breast milk. (a) PCA of samples in groups BM, PMF1, PMF2, PMF3, and
  control. PC1 and PC2 Scores of different samples are visualized, and the variance
  contributed by its corresponding component is presented. (b) GSVA analysis of each
  sample for GO terms associated with nutrition absorption in small intestine. (c)
  Venn graph of different groups’ DEG. (d,e) Gene over-representation analysis of
  GO of (d) unique DEG of infant formulae group and breast milk group presented in
  functionally grouped network with terms as nodes linked based on their kappa score
  level (≥0.3) using a Cytoscape plug-in clueGO, and (e) shared DEG of all infant
  formulae and breast milk presented in dendrogram using methods adopted by GeneTonic.
  (f) Pathway enrichment analysis of KEGG for shared DEG of all infant formulae and
  breastmilk. Top 12 enriched significant pathways (p value < 0.05) ordered by count
  were presented
