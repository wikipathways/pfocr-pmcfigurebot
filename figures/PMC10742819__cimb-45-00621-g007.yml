figure_title: Identification of hormone-related and UV-B-related genes between UV-B
  and CK tubers.
caption: Identification of hormone-related and UV-B-related genes between UV-B and
  CK tubers. (A) Heatmap showing 44 DEGs in ethylene-activated signaling pathway (GO:0009873).
  (B) Heatmap showing 8 DEGs in JA biosynthetic process (GO:0009695). (C) Heatmap
  showing 26 UV-B-related genes in potato tubers, including 15 UVR8, 2 COP1, 1 HY5,
  and 8 BBX. Genes with an underline represent a DEG, the rest display no significant
  difference
