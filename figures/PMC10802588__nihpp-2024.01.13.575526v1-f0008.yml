figure_title: Transcriptomic analysis reveals alpha-synuclein involvement in nucleolar
  DNA damage pathways
caption: A) Total RNA was extracted from SK-Mel28 control and KO cells and sent for
  RNA-sequencing analysis at Indiana University. Differentially expressed gene transcripts
  in KO cells compared to control were identified. These were cross-referenced to
  over 500 nucleolar-specific genes. 64 genes were identified and plotted on a volcano
  plot using p-value and fold change. All transcripts, greater than 1 standard deviation
  and less than âˆ’1 standard deviation were plotted. Red labelling indicated RT-PCR
  validated genes. B) All significant upregulated and downregulated transcripts underwent
  gene ontology analysis, which included pathways associated with molecular function,
  cellular component, and biological process. Gene sets found to be significant after
  Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction (P.adj < 0.05) were marked with an
  asterisk. C) Graphic outlining mechanistic function of alpha-synuclein in the nucleolar
  DNA damage response pathway
