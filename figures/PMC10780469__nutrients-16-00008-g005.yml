caption: mRNA expression profiles and effects of herbal extracts on DNA damage checkpoint
  activation, apoptosis, and hedgehog pathway components. (A) mRNA expression profile
  of hedgehog signaling components in C. elegans treated with V. lobelianum extract.
  wrt-1 and hog-1 were significantly downregulated. (B) Upregulation of the hedgehog
  signaling pathway when jervine was used alone. (C) Jervine extract did not increase
  the number of pCHK-1 foci (1.4 vs. 0.6 in control and +jervine, p < 0.0001). Bar
  = 2 µm. (D) V. lobelianum extract did not induce apoptosis (1.4 vs. 1.0 in control
  and +jervine, p = 0.1077). Bar = 20 µm. (E) O. cornuta extract led to the upregulation
  of the hedgehog pathway components wrt-1, hog-1, ptc-3, and qua-1, distinct from
  V.l. extract. V.I. and O.c. were added to a final concentration of 0.03 μg/mL. The
  concentration of Jervine was 20 μM. Asterisks indicate statistical significance
  according to the two-tailed Mann–Whitney test
