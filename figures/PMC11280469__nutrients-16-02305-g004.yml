caption: (A) PLS-DA Score Plot of Pathway Enrichment Analysis performed using all
  surveyed metabolites mapped to canonical KEGG pathways. Dots represent change in
  metabolic activity between groups across time points; size of dot represents the
  size of the pathway; darker colors (ranging from white to dark red) represent higher
  hits. (B) KEGG IDs referenced in pathway diagram. Key metabolite names are noted.
  Highlighted boxes represent up-regulated compounds. NAD+ salvage pathway noted with
  green arrows
