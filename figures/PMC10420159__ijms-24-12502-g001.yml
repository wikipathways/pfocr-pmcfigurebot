figure_title: Immune checkpoints in a tumor microenvironment (TME).
caption: 'Immune checkpoints in a tumor microenvironment (TME). T cell activation
  is induced as APCs present tumor antigens to naïve T cells. The MHC and TCR signaling
  pathway provides a signal for T cell activation whereas immune checkpoints inhibit
  T cell activation in TME. Immune checkpoint markers are expressed on T cells, and
  ligands are present on APCs, tumor cells, and stromal cells such as CAFs and MDSCs.
  Abbreviations: APCs—antigen-presenting cells; MHC—major histocompatibility complex;
  TCR—T cell receptor; TME—tumor microenvironment; MDSCs—myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells; PD-1—programmed death 1; PD-L2—programmed cell death ligand-2; VISTA—V-domain
  immunoglobulin containing suppressor T cell activation; HHLA2—human endogenous retrovirus-H
  long terminal repeat-associated protein 2; TIM-3—T cell immunoglobulin and mucin
  domain 3; Gal-9—Galedctin-9; CAFs—cancer-associated fibroblasts; LAG-3—lymphocyte
  activated gene-3; CTLA-4—cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4'
