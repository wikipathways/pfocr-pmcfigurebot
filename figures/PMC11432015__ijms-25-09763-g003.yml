figure_title: The IGF-1R signaling pathway plays a primary role in the neurogenesis
  effect of β-cyc.
caption: 'The IGF-1R signaling pathway plays a primary role in the neurogenesis effect
  of β-cyc. (A,B) Effects of the IGF-1R inhibitor T9576 and PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002
  on the neurite outgrowth elicited by β-cyc, its combination with low-dose NGF, and
  NGF 1 ng/mL. (C) Western blot analysis and digitalization of IGF-1R and p-IGF-1R
  levels induced by β-cyc dose-dependently. (D) Western blot analysis and digitalized
  results of p-IGF-1R, IGF-1R, p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, and AKT induced by β-cyc in a
  time-dependent experiment. Each experiment was repeated three times. The data were
  expressed as a mean ± SEM. * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared with the
  negative control; ### p < 0.001, compared with the 3 µM β-cyc group; $$$ p < 0.001,
  compared with the combination group of β-cyc with low-dose NGF; && p < 0.01, compared
  with the low-dose NGF, ns indicates no significant difference, compared with the
  low-dose NGF'
