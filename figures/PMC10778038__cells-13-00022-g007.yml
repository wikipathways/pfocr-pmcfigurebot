caption: Effect of EAHDT on stemness markers and c-MET-mediated signaling pathway
  in Huh7-derived LCSCs. (A,B) Huh7 LCSCs were exposed to EAHDT (10, 20, 40 μg/mL)
  for 48 h. Protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies
  and further quantified by densitometry. β-Actin levels were used as a loading control.
