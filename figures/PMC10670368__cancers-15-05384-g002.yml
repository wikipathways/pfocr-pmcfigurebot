caption: SHP2 is critical in regulating RAS/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT signaling
  pathways in cancer cells. These pathways involve cell growth, differentiation, metabolism,
  and apoptosis. SHP2 positively influences the RAS/ERK signaling pathway. Based on
  substrate specificity, SHP2 has a dual role in PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT pathways
