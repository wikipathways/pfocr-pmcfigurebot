caption: Pathway analysis and co-expression changes in the proteome and transcriptome
  of H. rhodopensis. (A) Scatter plot of averaged log2 transformed fold changes of
  abundances of RNA contigs (x-axis) and the corresponding proteins (y-axis). Colored
  bar represents significant expression changes above log2 of 0.5 for contigs and
  proteins (n.c.—no change; arrow up—upregulation; arrow down—downregulation). (B)
  RNA contigs and peptides annotated in the CLUE GO network were searched against
  the KEGG database and visualized together with available metabolomic data to clarify
  their involvement in cellular metabolism. Squares represent assigned proteins, rectangles
  represent transcripts, and circles represent metabolites. The colored bar represents
  changes in log2 FC between plants in the fresh and dry states. P—phosphorylation
  event. (C) Pathway signal flow analysis. The pathway was constructed by condensing
  and enriching a subset of reactions from several primary metabolism pathways of
  A. thaliana downloaded from KEGG. Unidirectional edges were used for reactions.
  Nodes are colored from blue to red, corresponding to low to high signals, respectively.
  The median was regarded as one because it represented the normal state.
