  energy-DNA management functionality.
caption: 'The GPR19−MDC1 intersection data corpus encapsulates a microcosm of energy-DNA
  management functionality. A signaling-based minimal network (SIGNOR 2.0 Database—NetworkAnalyst:
  https://www.networkanalyst.ca/: accessed on 21 February 2023) was created for the
  GPR19-MDC1 32 protein intersection and was found to be centered upon many of the
  input thirty-two proteins (9/10 top network-controlling proteins were from the input
  thirty-two protein data corpus: (A). Applying KEGG signaling pathway annotation
  to the SIGNOR 2.0 network, an encapsulation of the overall GPR19 perturbagen phenotype
  was found, i.e., prominent pathways linked to cancer, DNA damage, and cell fate
  were defined. The signaling network was additionally found to be effectively linked
  to multiple proteins linked to classical signs of metabolic dysfunction. This indicates
  a novel functionality for GPR19−MDC1 (B). The proteins across the signaling network
  associated with the metabolic pathways are color coded on the network and correlate
  with the associated enrichment plot (B)'
