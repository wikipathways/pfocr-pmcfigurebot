caption: 'Involvement of insulin signaling pathway in changes to 3D chromatin in pancreatic
  cancer cells. (A) Overview of insulin signaling pathway (ISP). Left: major key molecules
  in ISP. Right: list of ISP genes—genes with missing looping events after ICG-001
  treatment in PANC1/PATC53 are highlighted with red background. (B) Comparison of
  compartment changes in ISP and Non-ISP in PANC1 and PATC53. Left column: C-score
  difference. Right column: number of compartment changes. * and **: Wilcoxon rank-sum
  test. ISP: genes of insulin signaling pathway. Non-ISP: genes not in insulin signaling
  pathway. (C) Number of differential TADs, in various shifted lengths of TAD boundaries
  upstream to TSS. *: paired samples t-test. ISP: genes of insulin signaling pathway.
  Non-ISP: genes not in insulin signaling pathway. (D) Number of genes of insulin
  signaling pathway with changed loops in PANC1 and PATC53. None to None: no looping
  events with or without ICG-001 treatment. Loop to Loop: having looping events with
  or without ICG-001 treatment. None to Loop: looping events gained after ICG-001
  treatment. Loop to None: looping events lost after ICG-001 treatment.'
