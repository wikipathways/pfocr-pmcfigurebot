caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway to generate compound 6 (threopeptin). SnaA
  links two arginines through a ureido group and SnaB installs a propionate extension
  unit. The drawing assumes that threonine addition occurs on the assembly line. However,
  compounds 4-7 could also be the substrate of SnaE. SnaO installs the enone by dehydrogenation.
  Compounds 1, 2, and 3 are formed from spontaneous nonenzymatic cyclization from
  compounds 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
