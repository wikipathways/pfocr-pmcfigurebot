figure_title: (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites.
caption: (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites. The blue
  represents the p value, which means the metabolic pathway was significantly influenced.
  The size of the point represents the number of relevant metabolites involved in
  this pathway. (B) Correlation network diagram of differential metabolites based
  on r > 0.6 (or r < −0.6) and p value < 0.05
