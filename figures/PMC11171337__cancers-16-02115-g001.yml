caption: Synthesis of glycerophospholipids and TAG. The initial stages of the synthesis
  of all described glycerophospholipids and TAG involve attaching two acyl groups
  to glycerol-3-phosphate. The addition of the first acyl group is catalyzed by GPAT
  and the second one by AGPAT, leading to the formation of phosphatidic acid. Subsequently,
  the lipid synthesis pathway diverges into three routes. In the first route, phosphatidic
  acid is transformed into DAG by lipins. DAG then undergoes further reactions to
  become PE, PC, PS, or TAG. Phosphatidic acid can also be converted into CDP-DAG.
  CDP-DAG is transformed into PI or CL and PG
