caption: Inhibiting H2AX can suppress the expression of p-JNK and mitochondrial autophagy
  and fusion, as well as attenuate apoptosis in cardiac myocytes through the P53/SHP2
  signaling pathway. (a) Western blotting and relative expression of p-H2AX, P53,
  p-JNK, SHP, p-SHP2, and p-RAS. (b) Western blotting and relative expression of parkin,
  Drp1, Cyt-C, Caspase-3, and Caspase-8. ∗∗P < 0.001. (c) Western blot grayscale statistics
