caption: '(A) Western blot analysis of phosphorylated signaling pathway elements in
  co-treatments. (B) Representative Western blots for pSTAT3, p50, p105 and p60. Treatments:
  Ctrl = absolute ethanol for 48 h; Tg = thapsigargin for 24 h, then ethanol for 24
  h; VD = vitamin D for 24 h, then ethanol for 24 h; VD+Tg = vitamin D for 24 h, then
  thapsigargin for 24 h; Tg+VD = thapsigargin for 24 h, then vitamin D for 24 h. The
  asterisks represent a significant difference compared to the control, while the
  crosses represent a significant difference compared to the Tg treatment if the p-value
  was lower than 0.05'
