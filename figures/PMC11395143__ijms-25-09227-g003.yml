caption: 'Summary of biogenesis and trafficking of MPZ in healthy Schwann cells compared
  to pathomechanisms in CMT1B Schwann cells. The upper half of the figure illustrates
  the normal biogenesis and trafficking of MPZ in healthy Schwann cells. MPZ mRNA
  is processed in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm, where it is translated.
  Properly folded and modified MPZ proteins (depicted in purple) enter the ER, are
  transported in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and sorting,
  and are ultimately trafficked to the plasma membrane of myelinating Schwann cells
  [8]. The lower half of the figure depicts two potential pathways by which MPZ mutations
  can lead to demyelination, resulting in CMT1B. (A) shows that mutations in MPZ can
  cause protein misfolding, leading to the accumulation of mutant MPZ proteins (depicted
  in red) in the ER. This accumulation can trigger ER stress and activate the UPR
  and ERAD pathways [7,51]. (B) illustrates an alternative scenario where mutant MPZ
  proteins are correctly transported to the Golgi but are then misrouted and trafficked
  to the plasma membranes of cell types other than myelinating Schwann cells [8,63].
  Both pathogenic mechanisms have been observed to contribute to the development of
  the CMT1B phenotype. Abbreviations: ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD: endoplasmic
  reticulum-associated degradation; GA: Golgi apparatus; MPZ: myelin protein zero;
