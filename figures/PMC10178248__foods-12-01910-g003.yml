caption: Effects of AFP on NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 cells. (A) Western
  blot analysis of NF-κB induced by AFP in RAW264.7 cells. (B) Histogram represents
  the quantification of AFP-stimulated p-p65 in RAW264.7 cells. Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD (n = 3). ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 compared with
