  proteins of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in TNF-α-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
  cells.
caption: STRING, functional enrichment analysis of fucoxanthin’s effects on 6 proteins
  of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in TNF-α-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
  cells. STRING protein–protein interaction network functional enrichment analysis
  of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in TNF-α-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.
  The network included 6 proteins with predicted functional partners, including FOXO1,
  RHOA, ELK1, EIF4B, IRS1, and PDK2. The legend displays the node network, color and
  content, and edge protein–protein associations and confidence
