figure_title: Developmental profile of KCC2 expression and BDNF signaling pathway
  activation in maturing cultured hippocampal neurons.
caption: 'Developmental profile of KCC2 expression and BDNF signaling pathway activation
  in maturing cultured hippocampal neurons. (A) Representative images of immunofluorescence
  showing MAP2 (green) and KCC2 (purple) expression in hippocampal neurons from 3
  DIV to 9 DIV. Scale bar: 10 μm. (B) The graph shows that the fluorescence intensity
  of KCC2 expression increased over time from 1 to 9 DIV. N represents the number
  of cultures = 3; n represents the number of cells = 35 for 1 DIV; n = 45 for 3 DIV;
  n = 32 for 5 DIV; n = 45 for 7 DIV; n = 35 for 9 DIV. For each condition, the mean
  ± SD was represented. (C) Representative images of immunofluorescence showing MAP2
  (green) and pTrkB (purple) expression in neurons from 6–7 DIV in control and Cr-proBDNF-,
  mBDNF-, TAT-Pep5-, and TrKB-IgG-treated neurons. Scale bar: 10 μm. (D) Box plot
  showing the quantification of pTrKB fluorescence intensity in the indicated conditions.
  N = 3; n = 36 for control; n = 38 for CR-proBDNF; n = 41 for mBDNF; n = 37 for TAT-Pep5;
  n = 45 for TrKB-IgG. Box plots show 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, minimum and
  maximum as whiskers, with the mean indicated as “+”. Compared using the Kruskal–Wallis
  test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test, *** p = 0.0008 for mBDNF vs. control, ***
  p = 0.0001 for mBDNF vs. CR-proBDNF, **** p < 0.0001 for mBDNF vs. TrKB-IgG, ****
  p < 0.0001 for mBDNF vs. TAT-Pep5'
