  of female BXD mice.
caption: Functional enrichment analysis of Esr1-correlated genes in femur bone of
  female BXD mice. (A) The correlated genes were submitted to Metascape tool, which
  employs a heuristic algorithm to select the most informative terms from the GO clusters.
  It samples 20 top-score clusters, selects up to the 10 best scoring terms (lowest
  p-values) within each cluster, then connects all term pairs with Kappa similarity
  above 0.3. The nodes represent enriched GO-BP terms and are colored by their respective
  cluster IDs, and the edges link similar terms. The most significant term of the
  cluster is displayed as a label to represent that cluster. (B) Pathways significantly
  enriched by the correlated genes. Genes involved in the most enriched pathway, ‘osteoblast
  signaling’ (based on enrichment ratio) are indicated inside the box. Enrichment
  ratio = number of observed divided by the number of expected genes from each category.
  (C) Correlation of the expression of osteoblast signaling pathway genes with Esr1
  expression. Positive and negative correlations are indicated by blue and red lines,
  respectively. Correlation R value is indicated by colour intensity, while significance
  p-value is indicated by line thickness. Thicker and darker lines indicate highly
  coexpressed genes (only significant associations have been shown in the figure for
  clarity)
