caption: Ouabain–NKA-induced changes in epithelial cultured cells MDCK. The figure
  outlines the diverse signaling pathways triggered by the binding of ouabain, at
  nanomolar concentrations, to NKA. It illustrates the resulting effects on cellular
  components, including voltage-dependent potassium ion channels (VDKC) and TRPV4
  channels, as well as the acceleration of ciliogenesis
