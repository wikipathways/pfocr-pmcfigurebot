caption: Fatty acid synthesis pathway (FASII) in food and pathogenic Lactobacillales.
  (A) FASII comprises a first initiation phase for precursor synthesis, followed by
  the recursive elongation cycle. The mature acyl-ACP products supply fatty acids
  for phospholipid synthesis. Products of FabM/FabN are unsaturated (in gold), while
  those of FabI/FabK are saturated. Proteins performing the same functions may vary
  according to species. (B) FASII genes are clustered in streptococci (S. pneumoniae,
  S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes), E. faecalis, and L. lactis, and share a similar genetic
  organization. Proteins (in panel A) or coding genes (in panel B) are in green for
  initiation functions, red for elongation functions, brown for FA-modifying functions,
  and gray for phospholipid synthesis functions. fabF1 is also named fabO. In panel
  A, the dashed arrow represents the shunt leading to unsaturated FA synthesis; in
  (B) dark blue, fabT; purple and light blue, acpA and acpB, respectively. Bent arrows,
  transcription start sites (, ); dashed bent arrow, suggested transcription reinitiation
  site (); *FabT binding sites; a single star represents one or two closely localized
  consensus sequences.
