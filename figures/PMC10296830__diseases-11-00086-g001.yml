caption: Schematic of the Hippo pathway and YAP/TAZ mechanosignaling. When cells encounter
  a rigid ECM, they respond by adjusting their cytoskeletal tension through integrin-mediated
  focal adhesions, which link the ECM to the intracellular F-actin cytoskeleton, involving
  important kinases such as FAK and other adhesion proteins such as Vinculin and Talin.
  This process leads to an increase in actomyosin tension and a reorganization of
  the cytoskeleton. Key components such as RhoA and myosin II motors are also required
  for this tension-mediated restructuring. The modulation of YAP/TAZ nuclear-cytoplasmic
  shuttling occurs in response to actomyosin tension, which transduces physical cues
  into cellular signals. The F-actin cytoskeleton also influences the mechanical properties
  and shape of the nucleus, promoting the nuclear entry of YAP/TAZ by inducing nuclear
  deformation, facilitated by the stretching of nuclear pore complexes. The Hippo
  pathway acts as a negative regulator of YAP/TAZ by directly phosphorylating these
  proteins through LATS1/LATS2 or indirectly by influencing the actin cytoskeleton.
  Conversely, actomyosin contractility can impact the activity of LATS1/LATS2 through
  the GTPase RAP2. Finally, compounds that are capable of influencing some stage of
  this intricate signaling pathway are highlighted in red squares
