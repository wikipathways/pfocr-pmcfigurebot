caption: Cornification and keratinization as the main putative pathways induced by
  exosomes. Suggested functional pathways induced by ICRP-derived exosomes based on
  proteins overexpressed in exosomes (target) relative to proteins present in the
  ICRP (background), 6.06–100% overexpressed in a Homo sapiens model
