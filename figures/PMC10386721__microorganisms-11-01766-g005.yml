figure_title: Taxonomically variable microbiota encodes similar metabolic functions.
caption: 'Taxonomically variable microbiota encodes similar metabolic functions. Each
  stack represents one sample. The 20 most abundant OTUs (A) and metabolic pathways
  (B) are represented with different colors. Pipe symbol (|) in the sample names shown
  below the plots indicates second collection. Topmost horizontal bars indicate samples
  from pigeons that fly (brown) and pigeons that do not (black). Small black rectangle
  below each plot indicates pigeon #13 replicated samples. The consensus taxonomy
  of the OTUs and the name of each metabolic pathway are shown in Table S2'
