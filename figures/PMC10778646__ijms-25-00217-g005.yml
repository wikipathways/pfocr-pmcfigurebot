figure_title: SARS-CoV-2 Spike is associated with Wnt signaling pathway.
caption: SARS-CoV-2 Spike is associated with Wnt signaling pathway. (A) Immunoprecipitation
  analysis of Spike and Wnt3a. 293T cells were transfected with flag-tagged Spike
  together with HA-tagged YFP, Wnt3a, or ACE2 proteins. Cell lysates were harvested
  at 48 hpt, incubated with HA agarose beads overnight, and subjected to Western blotting
  using rabbit anti-flag and anti-HA antibodies. (B) Pathways activated by Spike protein.
  293T cells were transfected with Spike proteins and were subjected to immunoprecipitation-mass
  spectrometry. The number of assigned genes and the percentage of gene frequency
  in the top 10 pathways detected by Panther analysis are shown (http://www.pantherdb.org;
