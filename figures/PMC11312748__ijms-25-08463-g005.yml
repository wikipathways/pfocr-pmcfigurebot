  signaling pathway.
caption: Transient transfection with miR-369-3p affects the downstream PDE4B signaling
  pathway. (A) Representative blots of PKA C-α, pCREB, and CREB protein expressions
  after miR-369-3p mimic transfection in Raw264.7 cells without and with LPS stimulation.
  Western blot quantitative analysis of PKA C-α (B) and pCREB/CREB (C) expressions
  after miR-369-3p mimic transfection at 30 and 50 nM in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated
  cells. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping protein to normalize the data. Data are
  representative of four independent experiments. The histograms correspond to the
  mean ± SEM (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001)
