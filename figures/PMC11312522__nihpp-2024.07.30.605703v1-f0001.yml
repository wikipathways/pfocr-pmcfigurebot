figure_title: Cysteine deficiency drives rapid weight loss
caption: |-
  a, A simplified cartoon demonstrating the pathways for Cys synthesis (blue) and consumption (reversible – green and irreversible – brown). CSE deletion marked by red cross. GSH synthesis inhibitor BSO shown in purple. b, Average percentage weight loss (from starting weight) with removal of each essential amino acid and cysteine in male Het and KO mice after 1 week (n>=4 for each group). c, Daily weight curves of male Het and KO mice fed control (Ctrl) or No Cys diets at 22 °C housing (n=4). d, Cse KO weight curves of mice deprived of isoleucine, valine, or cysteine at 30 °C (n=4) e, Daily food consumption of Het or KO mice with Ctrl or No Cys diets (n=3). f, Caloric restriction of 2.1 g/day (CR) of male Het and KO mice with control 5CC7 and No Cys diets (n=4). g, Average percentage weight loss unaccounted for by reduced food consumption (including data from PMID: 22016194 for Iso and Val, 34800493 for Trp and Phe)14, 17
  h, Weight of male B6 mice on CR with No Met No Trp compared to No Met No Cys (n=4). i, Weight curves of male Het or KO mice over cycles of No Cys diet versus standard chow 5053 (n=4)
