figure_title: RepID negatively correlates with the DAB2 expression
caption: (A) Profiling of transcription levels of genes involved in Wnt signaling
  pathway in wild-type (WT) or RepID-depleted (KO) K562 cancer cell lines using PCR
  array. (B, C) DAB2 transcription is negatively correlated with the RepID. Expression
  of DAB2 transcripts was compared with RepID transcripts in all cancer dataset based
  on Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database using CellMinerCDB (B). Heatmap
  of transcription correlation between RepID and DAB2 from CCLE dataset (C). (D) DAB2
  transcription is increased in a RepID-depleted cancer cell lines. Transcription
  level of DAB2 was examined by qRT-PCR in K562 or DMS114 cell lines in RepID WT or
  RepID-depleted condition. Average of transcription level relative to GAPDH was indicated,
  and error bars represent the standard deviation (**P-value < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
  (E) DAB2 protein is highly expressed in RepID-deficient cancer cell lines. Immunoblot
  analysis with antibodies against DAB2 was performed and Histone H3 was used as loading
  control. Relative intensity of DAB2 protein was indicated as fold changes of RepID
  KO to RepID WT cells
