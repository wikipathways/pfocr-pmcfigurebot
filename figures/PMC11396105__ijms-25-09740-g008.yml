caption: The identification of subgenome dominance and KEGG enrichment analysis. (A)
  Subgenome expression dominance in pituitarium, liver and muscle tissues, and the
  shared and specially homoeologous genes among different tissues and genome references.
  In the red triangle, the letters of P, L, and M represented these homoeologous genes
  coming from the three test tissues. (B) KEGG results of specifically subgenome bias
  DEGs from paternal and maternal references. The key pathways are shown in red font.
  ASE represented allele-specific expression. DEGs represented differentially expressed
  genes. P, L and M represented pituitarium, liver and muscle. Pa and Ma severally
  represented paternal and maternal genomic alignments. The red color text and the
  yellow dashed box represented paternal genome alignment, while the blue color text
  and the yellow dashed box represented maternal genome alignment
