  and tyrosine kinase (TYK2) system.
caption: 'Cytokines and molecular mediators modulated by the Janus kinase (JAK) and
  tyrosine kinase (TYK2) system. The JAK/TYK2 system regulates the expression of numerous
  cytokines, growth factors, and hormones, resulting in a transcriptional crossroads
  of immune function and the inflammatory process. These kinases (i.e., JAK and TYK)
  interact with several transcription factors, namely those of the signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT) family, which, through intranuclear translocation
  processes, regulate the gene expression of molecules that are part of the signalling
  pathway that combinations among all the mediators previously exposed determine.
  According to a simplified scheme (top of figure), activation of the membranous receptor
  complex consisting of the various combinations of JAK and TYK family members (bottom
  part of the figure) by binding of a ligand, which may be, for example, a cytokine
  or a transcription factor (1), which results in downstream activation, mainly by
  phosphorylation processes of STAT family members (2), which in turn are activated
  intranuclearly by acting as transcription factors and modulating gene expression
  of several genes coding for crucial molecules in the inflammatory process (3). Note:
  IL: interleukin; EPO: erythropoietin; GM-CSF: granulocyteâ€“macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; G-CSF: granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; TPO: thyroperoxidase; GH:
  growth hormone; LEP: leptin; OSM: oncostatin M; IFN: interferon'
