figure_title: Effects of MA, AK, and MIX on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and
  FoxO3a in dexamethasoneinduced muscle atrophy
caption: 'The levels of FoxO3a (A), p-mTOR (B), p-PI3K (C), and p-Akt (D) were evaluated
  by IHC (Scale bar = 30 μm). Quantifications of immunohistochemistry staining of
  FoxO3a (E), p-mTOR (F), p-PI3K (G), and p-Akt (H). *p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001 compared
  with the normal group. #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001 compared with the
  dexamethasone-administered group. N, normal group; D, dexamethasone (600 μg/kg)-treated
  group; ML, dexamethasone and ML (100 mg/kg)-treated group; AK, dexamethasone and
  AK (100 mg/kg)-treated group; MIX, dexamethasone and MIX (100 mg/kg)-treated group.
  PC, dexamethasone and 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid (320 mg/kg)-treated group'
