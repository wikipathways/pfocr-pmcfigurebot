figure_title: Pathways highlighting the differentially expressed genes identified
  in this study
caption: (A) Up-regulated genes in the nitrogen metabolism pathway and. (B) Down-regulated
  genes in the citrate cycle pathway in RNA-seq. The scale represents the average
  fold change (FC) values between samples treated with cinnamaldehyde and the controls.
  The gene depicted in this figure are detailed in Supplementary File 4. (C) The gene
  expression data from RNA-seq and qRT-PCR validation of genes involved in the nitrate
  metabolism and citrate cycle pathways are shown, with relative values compared against
  the expression levels in the control. Error bars represent the standard error of
  the mean from three biological replicates
