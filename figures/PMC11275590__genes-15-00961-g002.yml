caption: CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting and inferred gene essentiality in lung cancer
  cells show porphyrin production. Whole genome loss-of-function growth phenotypes
  show that a partially functional heme biosynthetic pathway is required to survive.
  Gene essentiality is estimated from gene X dependency inferred from CRISPR/Cas9
  gRNA gene X knockout. Low and high cell viability with deletion of gene X indicate
  that the cancer cells have a high and low dependence on gene X for survival, respectively.
  Thus, the lowest and highest gene essentiality values are associated with the least
  and most profound dependence of the cells on the loss of gene X, respectively. The
  UROD gene for the fifth enzyme of the pathway has the highest essentiality in cancers,
  while genes encoding other enzymes are dispensable in many cancer cell lines. Each
  of the rows represents a distinct cancer cell line derived from primary and metastatic
  tumors. Numbers 1 to 8 indicate the order of the eight enzymes of the heme biosynthetic
  pathway. [ABCG2, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter subfamily G, member 2; ALAD,
  ALA dehydratase (aka porphobilinogen synthase); ALAS1, 5-aminolevulinate synthase
  1; CPOX, coproporphyrinogen oxidase; FECH, ferrochelatase; FLVCR, feline leukemia
  virus subgroup C receptor family; HMBS, hydroxymethylbilane synthase; PPOX, protoporphyrinogen
  oxidase; SLC48A1, solute carrier family 48, member 1, a.k.a heme transporter HRG1;
  UROD, uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase; UROS, uroporphyrinogen III synthase]
