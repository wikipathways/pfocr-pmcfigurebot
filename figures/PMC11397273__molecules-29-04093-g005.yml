caption: A model for the promotion of milk fat synthesis in dairy cow mammary cells
  through the ubiquitination pathway by soysterols and myristic acid. Soysterols promote
  CD36 and ADFP expression by increasing intracellular ubiquitination levels. Myristic
  acid promotes fatty-acid-synthesis-related gene expression by antagonising the MARCH14-mediated
  ubiquitination degradation of ORP5. In addition, myristic acid activated the mTOR
  signalling pathway to assist milk synthesis
