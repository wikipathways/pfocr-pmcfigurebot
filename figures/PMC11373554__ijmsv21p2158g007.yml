caption: MetaCore enrichment pathway analysis of genes coexpressed with KDM5B in pancreatic
  cancer. We used the MetaCore platform to analyze genes coexpressed with KDM5B from
  the associated TCGA database. Our analysis revealed that "WNT/Î²-catenin signaling"
  ranked highest in the biological process analysis
