caption: Distribution of receptors in the enteric nervous system (ENS) involved in
  regulating gastrointestinal motility by cannabinoids. AEA and phytocannabinoids
  influence cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) located on enteric neurons, inhibiting the
  release of acetylcholine (ACh) and muscle contractility [8,71]. The role of CB2
  receptors in the regulation of motility is significantly smaller and seems to be
  important in pathophysiological states such as inflammation [6]. AEA can influence
  gut contractility via a non-cannabinoid receptor pathway, through the transient
  receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) [50], located on
  the enteric neurons, and G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) [51], as a putative
  endocannabinoid receptor. CM—circular muscles, LM—longitudinal muscles, MP—myenteric
  plexus, SMP—submucosal plexus, VIP—vasoactive intestinal peptide, SP—substance P.
