figure_title: Gene expression profiles of islets from 3-, 10-, and 15-month-old mice.
caption: 'Gene expression profiles of islets from 3-, 10-, and 15-month-old mice.
  RNA was isolated from the islets of the mice and relative gene expression was analyzed.
  (A) Glucose transporter genes of glucose transporter Slc2a1 and Slc2a2. (B) Genes
  of insulin signaling pathway: Insr, Irs1, Akt1, and Prkaa1. (C) Inflammatory cytokines
  of Il1b and Tnf. (D) Schematic diagram of the chronological change of gene expression
  during aging. The blue triangles denote an age-associated decrease in gene expression,
  while the red triangles denote an age-associated increase in gene expression. (E)
  Expression of Ghsr in pancreatic islets from 3-, 10- and 15-month-old mice. n =
  4. The data are represented as mean ± SEM. Individual data points are represented
  by circles (3-month-old), rhombuses (10-month-old) and triangles (15-month-old).
  #, p < 0.05; ##, and p < 0.01. (A) Slc2a1, 3 M vs. 15 M (p = 0.004), 10 M vs. 15
  M (p = 0.004); Slc2 a2, 3 M vs. 15 M (p = 0.045), 10 M vs. 15 M (p = 0.033). (B)
  Insr, 3 M vs. 10 M (p = 0.045), 3 M vs. 15 M (p = 0.005), 10 M vs. 15 M (p = 0.011);
  Irs1, 3 M vs. 15 M (p = 0.002), 10 M vs. 15 M (p = 0.048); Akt1, 3 M vs. 10 M (p

  10 M vs. 15 M (p = 0.009). (E) Ghsr, 3 M vs. 15 M (p = 0.003), 10 M vs. 15 M (p
  = 0.038) (Kruskal–Wallis). If not specified, ANOVA was used. Slc2a1, solute carrier
  family 2 member 1; Slc2a2, solute carrier family 2 member 2; Insr, insulin receptor;
  Irs1, insulin receptor substrate 1; Akt1, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1; Prkaa1,
  protein kinase AMP-activated alpha 1 catalytic subunit; Il1b, interleukin 1 beta;
  Tnf, tumor necrosis factor; Ghsr, growth hormone secretagogue receptor'
