figure_title: Arginine supplementation enhanced metabolic activity in polymyxin-dependent
  A. baumannii
caption: (A) Bacterial growth of AB5075S/D and AB18S/D in M9 media with arginine (0–20
  mM) as the sole carbon source.(B) Expression of astA/B/D/E genes in the ast operon
  in polymyxin-dependent strains (AB5075D and AB18D) with or without 16 mg/L colistin
  for 2 h compared to their polymyxin-susceptible wild-type strains (AB5075S and AB18S).
  *p < 0.05 (two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction).(C) 13C-labeling study of the
  arginine degradation pathway showing the relative labeling kinetics of the fully
  labeled 13C6-L-arginine and 13C5-L-glutamate and their intensity change across 2
  h. S, polymyxin-susceptible wild-type strains (no colistin treatment); D, polymyxin-dependent
  strain (no colistin treatment); DC, polymyxin-dependent strains treated with 16
  mg/L colistin. The labels M0, M1 … Mn indicate the number of carbons (0, 1 … n)
  labeled with 13C. All data were collected from M9 culture with three independent
  biological replicates and are represented as mean ± SD
