figure_title: The potential molecular mechanisms of TBX3 in OS.
caption: The potential molecular mechanisms of TBX3 in OS. Based on metastatic and
  primary OS samples, we identified four gene groups that are closely linked to TBX3.
  Wherein, metastatic-up-positive genes were primarily enriched in the Cell Adhesion
  Molecules (CAMs) pathway while primary-up-positive genes were primarily enriched
  Cell Cycle pathway. TBX3, T-box transcription factor 3; OS, osteosarcoma

  of T-box transcription factor 3 in osteosarcoma
