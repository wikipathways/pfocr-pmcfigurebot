caption: DnaJ-induced IL−1β expression is partially under the control of TLR2/TLR4
  signaling pathway. (A,B) Cells were pre-treated with either OxPAPC (A) or CLI-095
  (B) at the indicated concentrations for 1 h, followed by treatment with 1 μg/mL
  of DnaJ for 4 h. (C) Cells were pre-treated with 3 μM of CLI-095 for 1 h, followed
  by treatment with 1 μg/mL of DnaJ for the indicated time. (D) Cells were transfected
  with TLR2 siRNA at the indicated concentration. At 24 h post-transfection, the transfected
  cells were treated with 1 μg/mL of DnaJ for 4 h (left panel). The effect of siRNA
  was verified by immunoblot of TLR2 protein (right panel). (E) Cells were transfected
  with 20 nM of TLR2 siRNA. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the transfected cells
  were treated with 1 μg/mL of DnaJ for the indicated time. After treatment, the increase
  in IL−1β mRNA level was quantified by qPCR analysis, and the levels of protein were
  measured by immunoblot analysis. Data in (A,B,D) are expressed as means ± SD (n
  = 3). Data in (C,E) are representative of three separate experiments. **, p < 0.01;
  ***, p < 0.001 vs. DnaJ treatment alone
