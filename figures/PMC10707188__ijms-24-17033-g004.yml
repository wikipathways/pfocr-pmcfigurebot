figure_title: Nuclear Nrf2 activation by FA.
caption: Nuclear Nrf2 activation by FA. (A) Western blot analysis of Nrf2 in the nucleus;
  Nrf2 was verified in the nuclear fraction of the cell treated with FA (30 μM) for
  1–8 h. Western blotting for Lamin A/C also verified the same loading of protein.
  Relative band intensity of nuclear Nrf2. (B) Nrf2 was verified in the nuclear fraction
  of dose-dependent cells. The cells were treated with FA (3–30 μM) for 8 h. (C) Western
  blot analysis of Keap1 in the lysate cells. The HepG2 cells were treated with FA
  (30 μM) for 1–8 h. Western blot analysis of beta-actin verified the same loading
  of protein. (D) HO-1 was verified in the lysate cells. Cells were treated with FA
  (30 μM) for 1–8 h. Relative band intensity of HO-1. (E) Relative mRNA expression
  levels of the HO-1 target gene. HepG2 cells were treated with FA (30 μM) for 8 h.
  (F) Role of the AMPK pathway by FA to induce HO-1. HepG2 cells were pretreated with
  compound C for 1 h and thereafter treated with FA (30 μM) for 30 min. (G) Role of
  LKB1 by FA (30 μM) to induce HO-1 in HepG2 and LKB1-deficient HeLa cells. The data
  represent the means ± S.D. of replicate experiments at least three times. The significance
  of the statistical differences between each treatment group and the vehicle-treated
  control group (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01) was verified
