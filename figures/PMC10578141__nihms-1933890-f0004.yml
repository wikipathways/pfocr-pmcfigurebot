figure_title: CyTOF analyses of CD4 TTS cell metabolic pathways
caption: CD4 SMARTA T cells were transferred into WT mice followed by PyMG tumor injection
  or acute LCMV-Armstrong infection. On day 8, SMARTA cells from tumor dLN or spleen
  of LCMV-infected mice were isolated. SMARTA cells from uninfected mice were used
  as naive control.(A) Heatmap depicts the normalized Z scores of the arcsinh-transformed
  MSI of the indicated protein for each cluster.(B) Radar plot depicts the relative
  arcsinh-transformed MSI of the indicated proteins by each group, scaling as the
  percentage of the highest expression.(C) Heatmaps show the differential state comparisons
  (calculated by diffcyt19) between tumor-specific CD4 SMARTA T cells and LCMV-specific
  CD4 Th1 (top) or Tfh (bottom) SMARTA T cells. Coloration shows log2 fold change.
  *adjusted p value < 0.05.(D) Violin plots show the single-cell scoring of each metabolic
  pathway calculated as described in STAR Methods. Statistics were performed Wilcox
  test only comparing CD4 TTS cells with Th1 and Tfh. *p < 0.05. Data are representative
  of two experiments with at least three mice per group
