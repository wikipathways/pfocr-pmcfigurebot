figure_title: Expression changes in Drosophila 20E signaling pathway genes upon different
  dietary sterol treatments.
caption: Expression changes in Drosophila 20E signaling pathway genes upon different
  dietary sterol treatments. (A) The gene expression changes in the first instar larvae,
  about 48 h after egg laying. The chloroform-fed group was the control (black). The
  bars labeled with different lowercase letters are significantly different (p < 0.05)
  (B) The gene expression changes in the white prepupal stage. Cholesterol was added
  as a control (black), while other dietary sterols (green) were used to be compared
  with it. Data are reported as means ± standard deviation of three independent biological
  replications. The relative expression was calculated based on the value of the reference
  genes. “ns” means “no significant difference”
