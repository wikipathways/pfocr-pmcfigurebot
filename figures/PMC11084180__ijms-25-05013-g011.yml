figure_title: Expression levels of key genes in the DC-SIGN signaling pathway and
  the TLR signaling pathway after MsDC-SIGN silencing and A.
caption: Expression levels of key genes in the DC-SIGN signaling pathway and the TLR
  signaling pathway after MsDC-SIGN silencing and A. hydrophila stimulation. (A) Expression
  level of the MsDC-SIGN gene. (B) Expression level of the RAF1 gene. (C) Expression
  level of the TLR4 gene. (D) Expression level of the NF-ÎºB gene. (E) Expression level
  of the IL10 gene. * Indicates that there is a significant difference between the
  two groups of data in the experimental group and the control group (p < 0.05); **
  indicates that the difference between the two groups of data in the experimental
  group and the control group is extremely significant (p < 0.01)
