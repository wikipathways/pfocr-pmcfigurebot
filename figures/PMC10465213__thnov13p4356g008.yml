caption: TRPM2 protects against cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis and mitochondrial
  dysfunction in vitro by the regulation of autophagy via suppressing the AKT-mTOR
  signaling pathway.Trpm2-/- MEFs or mRTECs were pre-incubated with AKT inhibitor
  VIII (5 μM) or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Rapa, 50 nM) for 1 h before cisplatin (CP)
  intervention. (A) Immunoblotting analysis and quantification of LC3B II, p-AKT and
  p-p70S6K in Trpm2-/- and WT mRTECs following treatment with 5 μM CP for 24 h. (B)
  Representative confocal images of LC3 puncta in Trpm2-/- and WT MEFs expressing
  mRFP-GFP-LC3 following treatment with 20 μM CP for 24 h. Scale bars, 20 μm. (C)
  Quantification of autophagosomes (yellow dots, RFP+GFP+) and autolysosomes (red
  dots, RFP+GFP-) (n = 4). (D, E) Representative confocal images and quantification
  of mitolysosomes evaluated by immunofluorescence double-labeled TOM20 and LAMP2
  in mRTECs (n = 4). Scale bars, 20 μm. Then, Trpm2-/- mRTECs and MEFs were pre-incubated
  with rapamycin (50 nM), Mito-TEMPO (Mito-T, 200 nM) or Rapamycin (50 nM) plus 3-MA
  (5 mM) for 1 h followed by intervention of 5 and 20 μM CP for 24 h, respectively.
  (F) CP-induced apoptosis in mRTECs determined by flow cytometry (n = 3). (G) Level
  of mitochondrial ROS in mRTECs determined by the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI)
  of Mito-SOX (n = 3). (H) Mitochondrial membrane potential of mRTECs indicated by
  the ratio of red to green fluorescence intensity of JC-1 (n = 3). (I) Mitochondrial
  morphology of MEFs detected by the fluorescence of MitoTracker Red. Scale bars,
  20 μm. Data are presented as mean±SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using
  one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
