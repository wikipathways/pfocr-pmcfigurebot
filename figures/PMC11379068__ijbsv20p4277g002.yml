caption: Integration of RNA sequencing and metabolomics in primary neurons treated
  with hemin for 24 h. A) Volcano plot illustrating differences in gene expression
  between control neurons and those treated with hemin for 24 h (p < 0.05 and log2FCâ‰¥1).
  B-C) Gene set enrichment analysis of KEGG and GO gene sets based on the fold change
  of gene expression in the hemin-treated group. Significantly enriched gene sets
  (p < 0.05) were identified, and the selected gene sets are highlighted in red font.
  D) Venn diagrams showing the number of differentially expressed genes that overlap
  with MitoCarta3.0. E) KEGG analysis of the 29 differentially expressed genes that
  overlap with MitoCarta3.0. F) Volcano plot depicting differentially expressed metabolites
  between the control group and the hemin-treated group (p < 0.05, VIP value > 1).
  G) Rectangular tree diagram for enrichment analysis of differential metabolite metabolic
  pathways. The size of the square indicates the pathway's impact on the topology
  analysis, and the color represents the p-value of the enrichment analysis. H) Joint
  pathway analysis of significantly altered genes (RNA-sequencing, right) and metabolites
  (metabolomics, left)
