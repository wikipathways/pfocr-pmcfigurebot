caption: Flow chart for using BDSC or FlyBase to find stocks. Use BDSC for stock numbers
  since it has the most current information about genotype and stock availability.
  Use FlyBase for reference, gene ontology, and pathway searches. Symbols (gene, component)
  on the BDSC webpage are linked to FlyBase, which provides vast genetic and molecular
  data, linkouts, and references for further reading
