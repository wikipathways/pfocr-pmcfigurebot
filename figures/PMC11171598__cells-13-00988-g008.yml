  Mecp2fl/flAdvillincre mice after birth.
caption: The BDNF-TrkB-CREB1 signaling pathway was activated in forebrain of Mecp2fl/flAdvillincre
  mice after birth. Protein levels of BDNF, p-CREB1, CREB1, and TrkB in forebrain
  (a) were determined by western blot. The semi-quantitative protein levels of target
  genes were normalized to Tubulin (b). Mecp2fl/fl n = 6, Mecp2fl/flAdvillincre n
  = 8. p value was determined by two-way ANOVA. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001,
  **** p < 0.0001
