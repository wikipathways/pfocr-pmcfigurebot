figure_title: PM-induced AREG expression promotes glutamine metabolism in lung cancer
  through the EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
caption: PM-induced AREG expression promotes glutamine metabolism in lung cancer through
  the EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. (A) A549.PM cells were transfected with AREG shRNA
  for 24 hr. Western blot analysis examined levels of EGFR phosphorylation and β-actin.
  The graphs demonstrate densitometric analysis of p-EGFR/EGFR. (B) Signaling pathways
  in A549.PM cells were analyzed by RNA Sequencing. (C) Cells were treated with indicated
  inhibitors, and the expression of SLC1A5 was verified by qPCR. (D) A549.PM cells
  were transfected with AREG shRNA for 24 hr. Western blot analysis examined levels
  of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR phosphorylation and β-actin. The graphs demonstrate densitometric
  analysis of p-PI3K/PI3k, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR. A549.PM cells were incubated
  with PI3K, AKT, and mTOR inhibitor or PI3K, AKT, and mTOR siRNA for 24 h. (E&F)
  Levels of glutamine expression were examined by glutamine Assay Kit. *p < 0.05 compared
  with A549.Par or A549.PM expression
