figure_title: Microbial metabolic pathways in stool of men with obesity.
caption: 'Microbial metabolic pathways in stool of men with obesity. Asterisks mean
  statistical difference between groups (p > 0.05). The statistical difference corresponds
  to the groups where the bar with an asterisk begins and ends. (A) starch degradation
  V metabolic pathway intergroup; (B) glycolysis III (from glucose) metabolic pathway
  intergroup; (C) glycogen degradation I metabolic pathway intergroup in stool of
  men with overweight at endpoint by White’s parametric t-test; (D) Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1
  sorghum intragroup relative abundance; (E) Dorea sorghum intragroup relative abundance;
  (F) Odoribacter sorghum intragroup relative abundance; (G) Turicibacter sorghum
  intragroup relative abundance; (H) CAG-873 sorghum intragroup relative abundance.
  Statistical analysis was performed in STAMP software version 2.1.3. considering
  α = 0.05. SGB: sorghum group at baseline; SGE: sorghum group at endpoint; WGB: wheat
  group at baseline; WGE: wheat group at endpoint'
