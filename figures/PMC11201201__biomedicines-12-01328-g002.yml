caption: 'VEGFR activation by the VEGF family of growth factors and resulting downstream
  signaling pathways to angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Family of glycoproteins
  including placental growth factors (PIGF) and VEGF-A, -B, -C, and -D bind to extracellular
  immunoglobulin (Ig) loops of VEGFR-1, -2, and-3. VEGFR-1 and -2 are mostly expressed
  on endothelial cells (ECs) and some cancer cells. This binding activates downstream
  signaling pathways, including RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, as well as PI3K-AKT-mTOR and NCK-MAPK
