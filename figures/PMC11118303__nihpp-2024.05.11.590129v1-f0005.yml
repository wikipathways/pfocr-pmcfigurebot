figure_title: Mid-palatal suture midline mesenchyme marker genes have dynamic expression
  in cranial sutures, growing more restricted over time
caption: |-
  (A) e15.5 coronal palate pentachrome histological stain at low magnification, with major components of the midline mesenchyme annotated in lower magnified panel. MES: Midline Epithelial Seam. (B) Seurat clusters from graph-based clustering of e15.5 palatal shelf, with yellow (cluster 4) marking the midline mesenchyme on visual assessment. Top panel: spatial dimplot, bottom panel: UMAP. Each circular barcode includes whole transcriptome sequencing information for 3â€“10 adjacent cells. (C) Expression of selected midline mesenchyme markers genes identified from Visium e15.5 cluster 4 targets using the FindMarkers() Seurat function: Sfrp2 and Tnn.
  (D) Joint FeaturePlot expression of Sfrp2, Tnn, or both (Sfrp2_Tnn) in scRNA-seq UMAP plots generated for e16, e18, P10, and P28 frontal sutures. Red color indicates Sfrp2 expression, green indicates Tnn expression, and yellow points highlight co-expression of both genes. Plots are labeled with categorical annotation of mes (mesenchymal clusters) or other (remaining clusters). Yellow points are mainly found in mesenchymal clusters across all ages. (E-H) RNAscope in situ hybridization for Dkk1 (yellow) and Lrp6 (cyan) mRNA on coronal samples through the middle plane of palate sectioning at e17.5 and P3, overview in E. Note high expression of Lrp6, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, in the midline mesenchyme of all sutures. Colored rectangles indicate regions of magnification for panels F (mid-palatal suture), G (frontal suture), and H (zygomatic suture). DAPI nuclear counterstain is dark violet. b: brain; e: eye; fs: frontal suture; mps: mid-palatal suture; t: tongue; zs: zygomatic suture
