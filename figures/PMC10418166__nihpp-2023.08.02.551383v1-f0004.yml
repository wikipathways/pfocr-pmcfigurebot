figure_title: sFRP2 promotes basaloid differentiation of human AEC2s
caption: (A) Immunofluorescence for SFTPC and KRT5 of AEC2-derived organoids co-cultured
  with MRC5 cells treated with various concentration of sFRP2 (10, 30, and 60 ng.ml−1)
  for 14 days. Representative of n = 5 biologically replicates. The experiment was
  performed in a technical triplicate and data from three technical replicates are
  counted as one biological replicate. (B) Quantification of the percent of SFTPC+/KRT5−,
  SFTPC+/KRT5+, and SFTPC−/KRT5+ cells in day-14 AEC2s + MRC5 organoids treated with
  sFRP2. (C) Level of expression of krt5 and axin2 mRNA level in EPCAM+ cells isolated
  from day-14 AEC2s + MRC5 organoids treated with sFRP2 (60 ng.ml−1). n= 4–5 biological
  replicates. The experiment was performed in a technical triplicate and data from
  three technical replicates are counted as one biological replicate. (D-E) Precision-cut
  lung slices from non-diseased donors were cultured and treated +/− TGFβ1 (4ng.ml−1)
  +/− sFRP2 (60 ng.ml−1) for 7 days. (D) Lysates were blotted for KRT5 and KRT17.
  n= 3 biological replicates. (E) Immunofluorescence analysis of KRT5 and KRT17. Representative
  of n = 3 independent experiments. (F) Immunofluorescence of AEC2-derived organoids
  co-cultured with AHLM after silencing the expression of sFRP2, with quantification
  of the lineages of the organoids (G). Data are presented as the mean of n = 3 biological
  replicates. (H) Summary schematic illustrating the sFRP2 transdifferentiation pathway
  of AEC2s to metaplastic basal cells was created with BioRender.com. Statistical
  significance was determined by mixed effects analysis followed by Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons test (B) and two-way ANOVA followed by Šídák’s multiple comparisons
  test (G)
