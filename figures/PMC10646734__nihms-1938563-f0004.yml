caption: |-
  BMDC from female mice show differential chromatin accessibility linked to type-I IFN at 4 weeks post-neonatal RSV infection. Neonatal male and female BALB/c mice were infected neonatally with RSV at 7 days of age and bone marrow collected 4 weeks post-infection. BMDCs were cultured in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor for 6 days and collected for assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing evaluation. Age/Sex-matched male or female mice were used as controls. N = 4–6 mice/group. (A) DARs between naïve male and female BMDC at 5 weeks of age were determined. Regions indicated in orange represent those regions more accessible in females. (B) Interferome v2.0 database analysis to determine DARs shown in (A) linked with interferon signaling. (C) Regions indicated in orange represent those regions more accessible in females. (D) Regions indicated in blue represent those regions more accessible in males. Gene Ontology term analysis of biological processes linked with early-life RSV DARs shown in (C); relevant immunological pathways are shown. (F) Selected gene annotations linked with DARs shown in (C) and their roles in type-I immunity. (G) Schematic of type-I IFN signaling pathway. Figure created using
  Biorender.com. (H) Interferome v2.0 database analysis to determine DARs shown in (C) linked with interferon signaling. BMDC = bone marrow-derived dendritic cell; DAR = differentially accessible region; EL = early-life; IFN = interferon; IL = interleukin; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus; Signal transducer and activator of transcription
