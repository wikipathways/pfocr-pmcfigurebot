caption: Comparison of SbEIL co-expressed genes with ethylene-related gene sets implicates
  SbEIL’s role in protein degradation during internode maturation stages. (A) The
  flowchart showing the process of SbEIL co-expression analysis and the comparison
  with the gene sets potentially regulated by ethylene. A literature review identifies
  six gene sets in maize of which their expression patterns were regulated by the
  ethylene signaling pathway (namely C2, C3, C9, C10, C12, and C18). The sorghum orthologs
  of the six gene sets were compared with SbEIL-containing co-expression modules (namely
  RioM1, BTx406M2, and R9188M9) to generate the intersection gene sets (designated
  as RioM1-C2, RioM1-C3, RioM1-C9, and RioM1-C10 and BTx406M2-C9, BTx406M2-C12, and
  BTx406M2-C18) that were significantly enriched with ethylene regulated genes (Phypergeometric
  < 0.05). (B) The expression patterns of sets of genes that are regulated by the
  ethylene signaling pathway (due to ZmACS7 overexpression) under normal and low-nitrogen
  treatments [52]. In the bar plots, relative expression levels scaled from 0 to 1
  were used. (C) The Venn diagram of the gene sets RioM1-C2, RioM1-C3, RioM1-C9, and
  RioM1-C10 showing these gene sets have only a few overlapped genes; we, therefore,
  combine these gene sets into one set namely RioM1-eth. (D) The Venn diagram of the
  gene sets BTx406M2-C9, BTx406M2-C12, and BTx406M2-C18 showing these gene sets have
  only a few overlapped genes; we, therefore, combine these gene sets into one set
  namely BTx406M2-eth. (E) The Venn diagram of the gene sets RioM1-eth, BTx406M2-eth,
  and R9188M9-eth. (F) Significant overlaps between the SbEIL-containing co-expression
  modules of sorghum internode RNA-seq data (i.e., BTx406M2, BTx406M4, RioM1, and
  R9188M9) and the gene sets potentially regulated by ethylene (i.e., C2, C3, C9,
  C10, C12, and C18) were detected (Phypergeometric < 0.05) and are shown in the heatmap.
  Green and purple colors reflect the log10 (p values) of the hypergeometric test,
  while purple stands for significantly over-enriched, and green means under-enriched.
  The significant overlaps between the gene sets were highlighted with red boxes.
  (G) The heat map showing the expression patterns of the gene sets RioM1-eth, BTx406M2-eth,
  and R9188M9-eth. Blue and red colors reflect the extent of log2 (fold change) relative
  to the anthesis stage (T2). (H) Functional enrichment analysis of the gene sets
  RioM1-eth, BTx406M2-eth, and R9188M9-eth calculated by hypergeometric tests highlights
  that protein degradation- and processing-related genes are enriched in the ethylene-regulated
  sorghum gene sets. The heatmap shows log10 (p values) with the numbers on the heatmap
  indicating the number of genes associated with the functional term. (I) The expression
  patterns of protein degradation-related genes in the internodes of Rio, BTx406,
  and R9188
