caption: 'The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) evaluates the variable clustering
  patterns of the metabolites from space--lown NSCs and ground control. We show the
  data in a table format, where the rows represent individual metabolites and the
  columns represent the secretome sample from which molecules were detected: STM medium
  (yellow), GC-NSCs (blue), and SPC-NSCs (red). The color of the cell reflects the
  concentration of each metabolite to its corresponding sample, relative to the mean
  concentration level across the entire set of tissue samples. Respectively, the colors
  red, blue, and white within the table indicate an increase, decrease, or no significant
  change of metabolites. The pathways that the metabolites belong to are indicated
  to the right of the HCA. The HCA compares the metabolite change between the 0 G,
  1 G, and control groups. n  =  5 samples per group. HCA data analysis was generated
  using ArrayStudio'
