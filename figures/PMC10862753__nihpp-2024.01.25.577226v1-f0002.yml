figure_title: HCM cardiomyocytes are enriched in insulin receptor and actin binding
  pathway genes
caption: 'A) UMAP embedding of reiterative clustering of cardiomyocytes. B) Bar plot
  depicting proportion of major cell types of interest within control subjects (C1
  and C2) and HCM subjects (H1, H2, and H3) and proportions in pooled cohorts (Control
  vs HCM). C) Left: Embedding derived from Milo k-nearest neighborhood differential
  abundance testing and layout derived from UMAP embedding. Nodes with false discovery
  rate <10% depict neighborhoods and are colored by log fold changes for HCM (blue)
  versus control (red) samples. Right: Beeswarm plot depicting significant log fold
  changes for HCM (blue) and control (red) neighborhoods derived from differential
  abundance testing stratified by cardiomyocyte clusters (y-axis). D) Heatmap of top
  5 differently expressed genes derived from FindAllMarkers function in CM1, CM2,
  CM3, CM4, CM5, and CM6. E) Volcano plot derived from pseudo-bulk RNA differential
  gene expression. F) Enrichment map stratified by CM cluster depicting the proportional
  GO pathway analysis. Node size is determined by the number of genes within each
  GO pathway. G) Feature plots illustrating expression of normal, pre-stressed, and
  stressed cardiomyocyte scores derived from Kuppe et al. in combined HCM and control
  cells, overlaid on the original UMAP embedding'
