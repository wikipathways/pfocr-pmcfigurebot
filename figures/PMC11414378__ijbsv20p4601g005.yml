caption: Proteomics analysis demonstrated that Cel caused mitochondrial dysfunction
  and apoptosis in vitro. (A) Volcano plot depicting DEPs in Cel vs. Control (DMSO)
  groups. (B) Bubble diagram illustrating the analysis of signaling-pathway enrichment
  for DEPs using the KEGG database. (C) Cluster analysis of DEPs. (D) Statistical
  analyses of apoptosis related proteins among DEPs. Data were calculated by unpaired
  two-tailed t-test (mean Â± SEM, n = 3). **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, vs. Control. Cel
  celastrol, DEPs differentially expressed proteins, SEM standard error of the mean
