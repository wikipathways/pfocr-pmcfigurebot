caption: 'CIN and MSI signaling pathways in colorectal epithelial cancer: A modified
  cartoon from KEGG depicts known activated pathways in colorectal epithelial cells.
  Cyan rectangles are known anticancer-targeted genes. The pink\yellow sun symbols
  represent newly identified kinases in the context of MSI-high p53 Mut cell lines
  that could serve as an SL partner. The sun is located next to the pathway that it
  belongs to. MSI-only pathways are highlighted in red and MSI-high p53 Mut-specific
  pathways are in black'
