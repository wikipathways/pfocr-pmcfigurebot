caption: Association of EN2 with ERBB, insulin, BCR-ABL and JAK signaling. This figure
  shows EN2 interacting pathway components in orange and proteins that were shown
  to be activated in red. The other the pathway components are shown in gray. The
  signaling pathways were adapted from the KEGG pathways database. The first arrows
  starting from the different signaling kinases are color coded and sharp arrow heads
  indicate activating interactions and blunt arrow heads indicate inhibiting interactions
  and the arrows with the letter “P” indicate interactions which involve phosphorylation
  events
