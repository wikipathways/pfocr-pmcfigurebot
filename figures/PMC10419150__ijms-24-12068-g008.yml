caption: Exosomes from retinal organoids (Exo-ROs) markedly inhibit mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in the Royal College of Surgeons rats. (A) Representative
  immunofluorescence images for specific MAPK pathway markers in group 1 (scale bar
  = 50 µm). (B) Quantification of p-JNK, p-44/42, and p-p38 fluorescence intensities.
  The fluorescence intensities of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK),
  p-44/42, and p-p38 are significantly lower in Exo-RO-treated retinas than those
  in control or vehicle-treated retinas of group 1. (C) Representative immunofluorescence
  images for specific MAPK pathway markers in group 2 (scale bar = 50 µm). (D) Quantification
  of p-JNK, p-44/42, and p-p38 fluorescence intensities. The fluorescence intensities
  of p-JNK, p-44/42, and p-p38 are significantly lower in Exo-RO-treated retinas than
  those in control or vesicle-treated retinas of group 2 (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, by one-way analysis of variance)
