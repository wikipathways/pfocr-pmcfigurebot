figure_title: The combination of Gem and ABE demonstrates effective anticancer activity
  in PDAC patient-derived 3D organoid (PDO) models.
caption: 'The combination of Gem and ABE demonstrates effective anticancer activity
  in PDAC patient-derived 3D organoid (PDO) models. (A) Representative images of PDOs
  treated with Gem, ABE, and their combination for 48 h. (B) The average number and
  size of PDOs treated with Gem, ABE, and their combination for 48 h. (C) A schematic
  illustration of ABE-induced reversal of Gem resistance in PDAC. This illustration
  reveals that Gem can activate the MYD88/NF-Îšb axis, resulting in chemoresistance
  by upregulating the efflux transporters (P-gp) and hindering cellular apoptosis
  in PDAC cells (left). In contrast, ABE helps counteract chemoresistance by downregulating
  MYD88 and downstream signaling pathways in PDAC cells (right). * p indicates p <
  0.05 vs. control group; # p indicates p < 0.05 vs. combination group'
