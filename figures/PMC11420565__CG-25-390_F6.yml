  gastric cancer.
caption: 'Building CAFs-myeloid cells based regulatory network by Cellchat in gastric
  cancer. (A) The circle plots show the overview of cell- cell interaction numbers
  and weights between CAFs and myeloid cells in all patients inferred by Cellchat
  (Methods): The plot shows the numbers of cell-cell interaction between CAFs and
  myeloid cells (left), The plot shows the weights of cell-cell interaction between
  CAFs and myeloid cells (right). (B) The circle plots exhibit the weights of cell-cell
  communications facet by cell types. (C) The circle plots of CSF and FN1 signaling
  pathway network inferred by Cellchat, the arrows represent the direction of interactions.
  (D) Immunohistochemical double-staining of PDGFRA/CD163 demonstrated the crosstalk
  between iCAFs and TAMs, brown arrows represent the iCAFs and pink arrows represent
  the TAMs (Scale bars: 50Î¼m). (E) The Hierarchy plot of CXCL12 signaling pathway
  network reveals the unidirectional regulation of iCAFs towards distinct myeloid
  cells. (F) The sankey plot show the different incoming communication patterns of
  target cells in GC'
