caption: Sphingosine and ceramide pathway in SLS. Six metabolites were measured. Statistically
  significant metabolites in SLS are indicated by a number in parentheses corresponding
  to the ratio of mean SLS to mean controls. Metabolites that lack an associated number
  were either not measured or did not differ between the groups. Dashed arrow indicates
  a minor contribution of ceramide to sphingodienine synthesis. Deficiency of FALDH
  in SLS is indicated by a red X. FALDH, fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase; P-Eth, phosphoethanolamine
