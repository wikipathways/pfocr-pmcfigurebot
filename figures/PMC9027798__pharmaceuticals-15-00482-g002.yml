caption: Proposed mechanism of synergy between azoles and inhibitors that operate
  on the ergosterol biosynthesis and mevalonate pathways. In fungi, the synthesis
  of ergosterol occurs primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum, with the final product
  packaged into vesicles to be incorporated into the membrane []. Azole drugs inhibit
  Erg11, preventing lanosterol from being converted into dimethyltrienol and leading
  to the build-up of toxic methyl sterols. These are incorporated into the membrane
  instead of mature ergosterol, causing a loss of membrane structure and an inability
  to divide and resulting in the fungistatic arrest of growth []. Synergistic inhibitors
  co-operate at points up- and down-stream of Erg11, increasing the generation of
  toxic ergosterol precursors and other terpene-derived metabolites. The mevalonate
  pathway, upstream from the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, is responsible for the
  biosynthesis of squalene, a precursor to all fungal membrane sterols. Statins like
  atorvastatin inhibit the HMG-CoA reductases Hmg1 and Hmg2, which are responsible
  for the production of mevalonate from HMG-CoA []. Further downstream, bisphosphonates
  like zoledronate inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, or Erg20, which catalyses
  the production of farnesyl pyrophosphate from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate []. In
  the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, squalene is converted into squalene epoxide
  by Erg1, a squalene epoxidase, which can be inhibited by allylamines like terbinafine
  []. Downstream from Erg11, dimethyltrienol is converted again into dimethylzymosterol
  by Erg24, a sterol reductase that is inhibited by morpholine antifungals such as
  amorolfine [,]. The resulting destabilisation of the cell membrane means synergy
  can often produce a fungicidal effect in the pathogen.
