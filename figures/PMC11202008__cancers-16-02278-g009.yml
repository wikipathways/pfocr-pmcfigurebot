caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis for PaCa 5061 TK.007 (A) and WT (B) after treatment
  with GCV (IC50 concentration). mRNAs responsible for MIF regulation of innate immunity,
  MIF-mediated glucocorticoid regulation, and VEGFR family ligands receptor interactions
  were upregulated, while mRNAs of CCR3 signaling, ERK/MAPK signaling, p38 MAPK signaling,
  and ERBB signaling, phospholipases, and phagosome formation were downregulated
