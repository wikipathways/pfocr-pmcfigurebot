figure_title: CGA alleviated AFB1-induced oxidative damage by activating Nrf2/HO-1
  signaling pathway in L-02 cells.
caption: 'CGA alleviated AFB1-induced oxidative damage by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway in L-02 cells. (A) effects of CGA on the ROS production of AFB1-induced
  L-02 cells. (B) the T-AOC activity of L-02 cells in different treatments. (C) the
  SOD activity of L-02 cells in different treatments. (D) the MDA concentration of
  L-02 cells in different treatments. (E) the modular structure of CGA. (F) the modular
  structure of Keap-1-Nrf2 complex. (G) the high interaction energy (−9.4 kcal/mol)
  between CGA and Keap-1-Nrf2 complex. (H–K) Western blots and quantification of total
  Nrf2, Keap-1, and HO-1. (L,M) Western blots and quantification of Nrf2 in the nuclear.
  Note: No shoulder marker or same shoulder marker in the same row means the difference
  is not significant (p > 0.05), different shoulder markers mean the difference between
  groups was significant (p ≤ 0.05)'
