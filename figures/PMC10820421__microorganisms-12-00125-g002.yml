figure_title: Genomic functional analysis of Ehrlichia canis YZ-1.
caption: Genomic functional analysis of Ehrlichia canis YZ-1. (A) The functional analysis
  of genes, both number (Y-axis on the right) and percentage of total genes (Y-axis
  on the left), from E. canis YZ-1 was performed using the GO database (X-axis), which
  is established based on the biological process. (B) The number of genes (X-axis)
  from the E. canis YZ-1 in each metabolic pathway (Y-axis) was analyzed using the
  KEGG database. (C) The number of genes (Y-axis) of E. canis YZ-1 in biological functions
  (X-axis) was shown based on the COG database. (D) The number of genes from E. canis
  YZ-1 in each Pathogen–Host Interactions (PHI) category was shown here
