figure_title: CRISPR screen for factors affecting CTB binding to Colo205 cells identifies
  glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathway genes
caption: (A) Schematic of genome-wide CRISPR KO screen for mediators of CTB binding
  to Colo205 intestinal epithelial cells using FACS to collect low versus high CTB
  binding populations. (B) Top sgRNA gene targets (p < 10âˆ’6) enriched in the low (left
  panel) and the high (right panel) CTB binding populations relative to the unsorted
  input population of CRISPR KO library-expressing cells. (C) Schematic of lacto-
  and neolacto-GSL biosynthetic pathway which includes a top enriched sgRNA gene target
  of both low and high CTB-binding populations. (D) GlycoEnzoOnto analysis results
  identify glycosylation pathways significantly enriched (p < 0.05) in the low (top
  panel) and high (bottom panel) CTB screen populations
