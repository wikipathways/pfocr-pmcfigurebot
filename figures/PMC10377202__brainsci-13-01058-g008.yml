caption: 'Dexmedetomidine inhibits the activation of the p38/MSK1/NF-κB pathway. (A)
  Immunofluorescence in cells co-labeled with p-p38 (red) and IBA1 (green). (B) Immunofluorescence
  in cells co-labeled with p-NFκBp65 (red) and IBA1 (green). The white dashed arrow
  points to a higher magnification of the area in the white box. Scale bars: low magnification,
  400 µm; high magnification, 50 µm. (C) (a) Western blot analysis of proteins in
  the p38/MSK1/NFκB pathway in the prefrontal cortex; (b–d) Expression levels of phosphorylated
  proteins after standardization with respect to total protein expression; (e,f) Total
  protein expression after standardization with respect to GAPDH expression. CC, n
  = 8; SD, n = 8. Data shown are mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (b–d,f,g).
  ## p < 0.01 vs. CC; # p < 0.05 vs. CC; * p < 0.05 vs. SD + saline; NS, no significance'
