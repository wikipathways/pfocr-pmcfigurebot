figure_title: The knockdown of PLAUR expression hampered the in vitro malignant progression
  ability of ccRCC cells
caption: The relative expression of PLAUR in 786-O and ACHN cells was detected using
  qRT-PCR (A) and western blotting (B). (C) The CCK-8 assay was employed to evaluate
  the impact of PLAUR knockdown on the proliferatio of 786-O and ACHN cells. (D) Transwell
  migration and invasion assay was used to detect the effect of PLAUR knockdown on
  the migration and invasion of 786-O and ACHN cells.* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, ***
  P < 0.001.
