  analysis of DAMs.
caption: General overview of differential metabolites and pathway enrichment analysis
  of DAMs. (A) Heat map of differential metabolite clusters. The horizontal axis indicates
  the sample name; the vertical represents the differential metabolite information;
  and the clustering tree on the left of the figure indicates the differential metabolite
  clustering tree. Red represents the high content, and green indicates the low content.
  (B) Scatter plot of differential metabolites in KEGG enrichment analysis. The p-value
  approaching 0 depicts a more pronounced enrichment. The dimension of the points
  represents the corresponding number of the DAMs enriched
