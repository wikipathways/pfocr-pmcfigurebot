figure_title: SasC affects the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and spore germination.
caption: 'SasC affects the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and spore germination. SasC
  affects the cell wall perturbing agents by inducing sensitivity. (A) PKA activity
  levels of three strains as monitored using gel electrophoresis. (B) Germination
  rate of spores. Conidia were inoculated in MMY and incubated at 37° C for 14 h.
  (C) Expression levels of acyA and pkaC1 mRNA in WT, ΔsasC, and complemented (sasC
  C) strains analyzed via RT-qPCR. Statistical differences between strains were evaluated
  via Student’s t-test: ** p < 0.01'
