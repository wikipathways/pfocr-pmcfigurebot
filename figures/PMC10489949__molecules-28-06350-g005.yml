caption: The unique differential compounds of different comparison groups. (A) The
  Venn plot indicated the common different compounds as potential targets among three
  groups, and the bar chart revealed changes in their level among the three groups
  (* p value < 0.05, ** p value < 0.01). (B) Enrichment analysis of metabolic pathway
  of differential compounds between control and IR (left), IR and Cop treated (right)
