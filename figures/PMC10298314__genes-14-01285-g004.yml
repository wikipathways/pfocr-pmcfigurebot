caption: Establishment and validation of MPPSS for the diagnosis of AD patients. (a)
  The construction of MPP signature models based on multiple machine learning methods.
  The different color circles represent different machine methods. Dark blue represents
  Boruta, dark red represents xgboost, light blue represents LASSO, light purple represents
  decision tree, and dark purple represents random forest. (b) The performance among
  five machine learning methods on train and test datasets. The optimal method among
  five machine methods is marked by red asterisk. (c) The selection of MPP signatures
  by MPPSS; (d) The AUC curves of MPPSS on train and test datasets; (e) The AUC curves
  of MPPSS on four independent validation datasets; (f) The comparison of the APoE
  genotypes in two groups diagnosed by MPPSS on the metaGEO dataset; (g) The comparison
  of metabolic pathway activity in two groups diagnosed by MPPSS on the metaGEO dataset.
  The labeled asterisk indicated the statistical p values (** p < 0.01 and *** p <
  0.001). ROC curves include the AUC value and the corresponding 95% confidence interval
  (CI)
