figure_title: Differential genes analyzed in the Wnt signaling pathway.
caption: Differential genes analyzed in the Wnt signaling pathway. (A) Wnt signaling
  pathway annotation map of DEGs. The box represents the protein, red represents up-regulation,
  green represents down-regulation, and the rounded box represents another metabolic
  pathway. (B) GSEA analysis of all differentially expressed genes in the Wnt signaling
  pathway. The black vertical line in the abscissa represents the genes in the Wnt
  pathway; the ordinate in the above figure represents the dynamic enrichment score;
  the green curve represents the enrichment score of the gene set at each position;
  the peak of the green curve is the ES value of Wnt pathway. If the ES value is positive,
  the current function shows an upward trend; if the ES value is negative, the current
  function shows a downward trend
