caption: 'The molecular mechanisms of the ferroptosis pathway. Ferroptosis is triggered
  by three main regulatory pathways: iron metabolism, the GPX4 pathway, and lipid
  metabolism. In the iron metabolism, Fe3+ (ferric iron) is transported into the cell
  by TfR1 (Transferrin receptor) or obtained through the conversion of the heme group
  to biliverdin by HMOX1 activity. Then, Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ (ferrous iron) by
  STEAP3. Ferritin degradation by NCOA4 via autophagy also contributes to the labile
  iron pool. Once in the cytosol, Fe2+ can react with ROS and it generates the hydroxyl
  radical, promoting PUFA oxidation. The GPX4 pathway is responsible for controlling
  the lipoperoxidation levels through the reduction of lipid peroxides (PE-AA-OOH)
  to lipid alcohol (PE-AA-OH), thus GPX4 blockage by RSL3 induces ferroptosis. GPX4
  utilizes GSH as a cofactor, therefore the GSH synthesis pathway is directly related
  to GPX4 activity, and xCT system blockage by Erastin leads to ferroptotic cell death.
  In the lipid metabolism, AA (as well as other PUFAs) are metabolized by ACSL4 and
  esterified by LPCAT3. Then, LOXs oxidize PUFAs using Fe2+ as a cofactor, which produces
  lipid peroxides. Created with BioRender.'
