caption: The increased transcriptional genes related to flavonoid and capsaicin biosynthesis
  mainly mapped in the flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways. (A) the
  depiction of biosynthetic pathway of capsaicin. The heatmaps exhibited the expression
  patterns of genes associated with flavonoids (B) and capsaicin biosynthesis (C)
  among four groups. The metabolic pathway enrichment showed up-regulated genes associated
  with flavonoids and capsaicin biosynthesis were mapped in flavonoids (D) and phenylpropanoid
  (E) metabolism pathways
