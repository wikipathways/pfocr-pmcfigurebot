figure_title: Metabolites associated with mortality in PAH discovery and validation
  cohorts
caption: (A) Volcano plot of metabolites associated with mortality in discovery and
  validation cohorts. Data are derived from multivariable-adjusted Cox regression
  models. Red dots indicate deleterious metabolites significant in both discovery
  and validation cohorts; pink dots indicate deleterious metabolites significant only
  in the discovery cohort; dark blue dots indicate protective metabolites in both
  discovery and validation cohorts; light blue dots indicate protective metabolites
  significant only in discovery cohort; grey dots indicate all metabolites measured
  in discovery and validation cohorts. (B) Chemical networking of significant metabolites
  in both discovery and validation cohorts. Tandem mass spectra for the chromatographic
  features were clustered against tandem mass spectra for commercial standards with
  the resulting correlations displayed as a nested molecular network. Here, red nodes
  indicate tandem mass spectra for commercial standards, blue nodes indicate tandem
  mass spectra from glucuronidated compounds and grey nodes indicate tandem mass spectra
  from the 356 unknown compounds. (C) Manhattan plot of associations between genetic
  variants and glucuronidated 51 metabolite features. For single nucleotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs) with multiple associations, only the lowest P value is shown. The y-axis
  is truncated at −log10(P) for improved visualization, and SNPs with P>10−7 are omitted.
  Color scale reflect the number of metabolites associated with genetic variant. Top
  scale (dark red) indicates 30 metabolite and lower scale (dark blue) indicates one
  metabolite. (D) Schematic representation of primary bile acid synthesis pathway.
  Key enzymes associated with the glucuronidated 51 metabolite features are highlighted
  in yellow
