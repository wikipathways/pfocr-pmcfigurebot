caption: (a) Dedifferentiation induction of CD44-CD24+ tumour cells of T47D and BT-474
  lines after exposure to cisplatin and ICG-001 inhibitor. (b) Cellularity changes
  dynamics of CD44-CD24+ cell cultures of T47D and BT-474 cells after exposure to
  cisplatin and ICG-001 inhibitor; on the abscissa—time, days. (c) Differential-expressing
  WNT signalling pathway genes at 21 days incubation in CD44-CD24+ cells after ICG-001
  and cisplatin treatment and CD44-CD24+ cells without ICG-001 and cisplatin treatment;
  red—CD44-CD24+ cells without ICG-001 and cisplatin treatment than in CD44-CD24+
  cells after ICG-001 and cisplatin treatment, green—vice versa
