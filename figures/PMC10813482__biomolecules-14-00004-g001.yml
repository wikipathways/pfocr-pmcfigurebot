figure_title: DNA modification of MSCs in SONFH.
caption: DNA modification of MSCs in SONFH. Under the action of DNA methyltransferases
  (DNMTs), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is used as a methyl donor to enhance gene methylation
  modification. Hypermethylation is considered to be an epigenetic marker of gene
  “silence”. During the progression of SONFH, the expression of Frizzled1 in mesenchymal
  cells is inhibited and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway is upregulated and ABCB1
  is downregulated. However, ten-eleven translocation (TET, DNA dioxidase) can gradually
  oxidize 5 mC (methylation of 5-methylcytosine) to 5 hmC (5-hydroxymethylcytosine).
  These advanced oxidation products cannot be recognized by DNMT1, thus hindering
  the maintenance of methylation patterns during DNA replication and indirectly promoting
  DNA demethylation. DNA demethylation in MSCs leads to inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway and promotes SONFH process
