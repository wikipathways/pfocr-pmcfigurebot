figure_title: miR-1 down-regulation during MOV-induced muscle hypertrophy
caption: '(A) Venn diagram comparing significantly up-regulated genes in miR-1 KO
  compared to WT (“miR-1 KO up”), significantly up-regulated genes following 3 days
  of synergist ablation-induced MOV compared to sham (“MOV up”), and eCLIP-seq-defined
  miR-1 targets (CLIP target). Consensus genes listed. Venn diagram generated using
  https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/. (B) Pathway enrichment analysis
  of consensus genes between “miR-1 KO up” and “MOV up,” top 10 pathways by adj. p-value
  shown. (C) Outline of human resistance exercise training program and times of biopsy
  collection (T0: baseline, T1: after the 1st training session, T13: after the 13th
  training session, T14: after the 14th training session). (D) miR-1 expression in
  human skeletal muscle biopsies (from n=14 males) at the different time points of
  the resistance exercise training program. Differences in miR-1 expression at the
  different time points tested using a repeated-measures ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons. (E-F) Association between the change (Δ) in miR-1 expression and the
  Δ PKM1 protein levels at (E) T13 and (F) T14. (G-H) Association between miR-1 expression
  and PTBP1 mRNA expression at (G) T0 and (H) T13. Associations tested using simple
  linear regressions, p-values shown. (I) Type II fiber hypertrophy, demonstrated
  as percent change in Type II fiber CSA from T0 to T14. Participants divided into
  Low (n=7) and High (n=7) groups based on magnitude of CSA increases. (J) Percent
  change in miR-1 expression from T0 to T14 in participants in the Low and High fiber
  hypertrophy groups. Data in (I-J) analyzed using independent t-tests Ns: not significant,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.0001'
