caption: Schematic representation of clinical features associated with cytokine response
  in SARS-CoV-2 infections. 1. Coronavirus infects the cells of the lung. 2. Immune
  cells such as macrophages produce cytokines in response to the virus. 3. Cytokines
  attract more immune cells such as monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and other
  white blood cells which produce more inflammatory cytokines, resulting in hyperinflammation
  that damages lung cells. 4. Damage can occur through fibrin formation. 5. Weakened
  blood vessels allow fluid to seep in to the lung cavities, leading to respiratory
  failure. The activated cytokines result in clinical features involving fever (IFN-γ,
  TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), disseminated intravascular coagulation (IFN-γ, TNF-α), decreased
  serum protein (IFN-γ), hyperlipidemia (TNF-α), acute phase protein (IL-1β, IL-6),
  liver damage (TNF-α, IL-18), hemodynamic instability (IFN-γ, TNF-α), acute kidney
  injury (IL-6), and anemia (IL-6). Thapsigargin, Paroxetine, Parthenolide, Sertraline,
  and Spiperone are ERS pathway inhibitors that reduce the production of multiple
  proinflammatory cytokines (Step 2).
