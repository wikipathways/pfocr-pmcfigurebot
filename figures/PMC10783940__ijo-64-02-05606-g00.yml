caption: Western blot analysis of some key proteins associated with the FABP5 pathway
  in benign and malignant prostate cells, and western blot analysis was combined with
  DNA-sequencing analysis to verify the successful gene KO cell clones. An anti-β-actin
  antibody was incubated with each blot to standardize the immunological responses.
  Quantitative analysis was performed by densitometrical scanning of the area and
  peak of each band on the blot. The protein relative levels were reproduced independently
  three times, and the differences were assessed by Student's t-test for results with
  2 datasets, and one-way ANOVA test for results with 3 or more datasets. Dunnett's
  post hoc test was utilized for multiple comparisons following the ANOVA. (A) Relative
  expression of FABP5 pathway-associated proteins in benign and malignant prostate
  epithelial cells is shown. a) Western blot analysis of FABP5 in benign PNT2 cells,
  the moderately malignant 22RV1 cells, and the highly malignant prostate carcinoma
  cell lines, DU145 and PC3M. b) Relative levels of FABP5 protein in PNT2, 22RV1,
  DU145 and PC3M cells. The level of FABP5 in 22RV1 cells was set at '1', and the
  levels in DU145 and PC3M were obtained by comparing with that of 22RV1. c) Western
  blot detection of PPARγ in PNT2, 22RV1, DU145 and PC3M cells. d) Relative levels
  of PPARγ in PNT2, 22RV1, DU145, and PC3M cells. The level in PNT2 cells was set
  at '1', and the levels in the other cell lines were obtained by comparing with that
  of PNT2. e) Western blot analysis of pPPARγ in PNT2, 22RV1, DU145 and PC3M cells.
  f) Relative levels of pPPARγ in PNT2, 22RV1, DU145, and PC3M cells. The level in
  22RV1 cells was set at '1', and levels in DU145 and PC3M were obtained by comparing
  with that of 22RV1. g) Western blot analysis of ARFL protein in PNT2, 22RV1, DU145
  and PC3M cells. h) Relative levels of ARFL in prostate cell lines. The level of
  ARFL in 22RV1 cells was set at '1', and levels in the other cell lines were not
  detectable. i) Western blot analysis of VEGF protein in PNT2, 22RV1, DU145 and PC3M
  cells. j) Relative levels of VEGF; the level in PNT2 was set at '1', and levels
  in the other cell lines were obtained by comparing with that of PNT2. (B) Western
  blot and DNA sequencing analyses were performed to verify successful gene suppression
  in KO cell clones. a) Western blots of FABP5 protein in 22RV1 cells and its derivative
  FABP5-KO clones. b) Relative levels of FABP5 in 22RV1 cells and in its derivative
  FABP5-KO clones. The level of FABP5 in 22RV1 cells was set at '1', and levels in
  different clones were obtained by comparing with that in 22RV1. c) Further Western
  blots of FABP5 protein in 22RV1 cells and in the successful FABP5-KO clone C3. d)
  DNA sequence analysis revealed the location where the guide RNA-induced mutation
  occurred (depicted by the black arrow). e) Western blot analysis of FABP5 protein
  in DU145 cells and in its derivative FABP5-KO clones. f) Relative levels of FABP5
  in DU145 and in the different FABP5-KO clones. The level of FABP5 in DU145 was set
  at '1', and the levels in the different clones were obtained by comparing with that
  in DU145. g) Western blot analysis of FABP5 protein in DU145 cells and in a selected
  FABP5-KO clone (C2). h) DNA sequence analysis revealed the location where the guide
  RNA-induced mutation occurred (depicted by the black arrow). i) Western blot detection
  of FABP5 expression in PC3M and in different FABP5-KO clones. j) Relative levels
  of FABP5 in PC3M and in its different FABP5-KO clones. The level of FABP5 in PC3M
  was set at '1', and the levels in its different FABP5-KO clones were obtained by
  comparing with that in PC3M. k) Western blot analysis of FABP5 protein in PC3M and
  in its selected FABP5-KO clone, C6. l) DNA sequence analysis revealed the location
  where the guide RNA-induced mutation occurred (depicted by the black arrow). m)
  Western blot analysis of AR protein in 22RV1 cells and in its different AR-KO clones.
  n) Relative levels of AR in 22RV1 cells and in its AR-KO clones. The level of AR
  in 22RV1 was set at '1', and the levels of AR in different clones were obtained
  by comparing with that in 22RV1. o) Western blot analysis of AR expression in 22RV1
  cells and in its AR-KO clones. p) Relative levels of AR in 22RV1 and in its AR-KO
  clones. The level of AR in 22RV1 was set at '1', and the levels of AR in different
  clones were obtained by comparing with that in 22RV1 cells. ***P<0.0001 and ****P<0.00001.
