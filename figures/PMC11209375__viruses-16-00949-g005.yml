caption: A working model for the recruitment of TRIM21 to promote the ubiquitination
  and degradation of IKKβ by the ASFV MGF300-2R protein. The ASFV MGF300-2R protein
  recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 to ubiquitinate IKKβ, and IKKβ is subsequently
  recognized and degraded via the selective autophagic pathway, which subverts the
  NF-κB signaling pathway [6]
