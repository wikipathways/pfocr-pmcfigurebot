figure_title: Identifying amyloid-associated gene expression signatures
caption: 'a-b, Representative fluorescent whole-section images from one AD in DS (a)
  and one 12-month 5xFAD sample (b) stained with Amylo-glo and OC to mark dense amyloid
  plaques and diffuse amyloid fibrils respectively. ST data colored by cluster (left),
  amyloid quantification (middle), and amyloid hotspot analysis (right) are shown
  below the images. c-d, Spatial feature plots showing the amyloid hotspot analysis
  results (Getis-Ord Gi* statistic) for the human (c) and mouse (d) ST datasets for
  OC (left) and Amylo-glo (right). e, Box and whisker plots showing the distribution
  of amyloid quantifications in the human ST dataset, stratifying samples by their
  neuropathological plaque staging. Box boundaries and line correspond to the interquartile
  range (IQR) and median, respectively. Whiskers extend to the lowest or highest data
  points that are no further than 1.5 times the IQR from the box boundaries. f, Stacked
  bar plot showing the number of amyloid-associated genes from Amylo-glo, OC, and
  shared for each of the mouse ST clusters. Euler diagram shows the number of Amylo-gloand
  OC-associated genes in the human dataset, and the overlap between these gene sets.
  g, Bar plots show the number of Amylo-glo- and OC-associated genes that overlap
  with disease DEGs. h-i, Selected pathway enrichment results from amyloid-associated
  genes that were shared between Amylo-glo and OC (h) and OC-specific (i) in the human
  ST dataset. j, Selected pathway enrichment results from amyloid-associated genes
  that were shared between Amylo-glo and OC for each cluster in the mouse ST dataset.
  k, Heatmap showing gene set overlap analysis results with the mouse amyloid-associated
  genes and human (left), and with other relevant gene sets (DAA: Disease-associated
  astrocytes44; DAM: Disease-associated microglia43; DOL: Disease-associated oligodendrocytes45;
  PIGs: Plaque-induced genes70). Fisher’s exact test results shown as follows: Not
  significant (ns), p > 0.05; * p <= 0.05; ** p <= 0.01; *** p <= 0.001, **** p<=
  0.0001. l, Spatial feature plots of selected amyloid-associated genes in representative
  samples from the human (left) and mouse (right) ST datasets. m, Network plot showing
  module hub genes from the mouse spatial co-expression network module SM6. n, Euler
  plot showing the gene set overlap of the SM6 module and the PIGs module from Chen
  et al.70. o-p Spatial feature plots showing the module eigengenes for the SM6 module
  (o) and the PIGs module (p) in representative samples of the mouse ST dataset'
