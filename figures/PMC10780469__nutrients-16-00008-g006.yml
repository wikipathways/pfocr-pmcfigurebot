figure_title: MAPK pathway activation and its role in response to O.
caption: MAPK pathway activation and its role in response to O. Cornuta treatment.
  (A) Induction of the MAPK pathway components mek-2 and sos-1 upon O. cornuta treatment.
  mek-2 expression increased by 2.53-fold (p = 0.0006), and sos-1 expression increased
  by 6.86-fold (p = 0.0002) compared to the control. Additionally, mpk-1 and let-60
  expression was induced by 1.74-fold (p = 0.0003) and 1.43-fold (p = 0.0003), respectively.
  Asterisks indicate statistical significance according to the two-tailed Mann–Whitney
  test. (B) Activation of the MAPK pathway by individual compounds in O. cornuta.
  For instance, sugiol treatment increased mek-2 expression by 1.7-fold (p = 0.0002)
  and sos-1 expression by 3.65-fold (p = 0.0002). Thymol treatment resulted in a 2.54-fold
  increase in mek-2 expression (p = 0.0009) and a 4.0-fold increase in sos-1 expression
  (p = 0.0009). Intriguingly, linoleic acid induced all four MAPK components, while
  other compounds induced one or two genes. Various O. cornuta compounds (sugiol,
  thymol, linoleic acid, luteolin, and DHT) altered MAPK pathway expression. DHT,
  dihydrotanshinone. (C) Linoleic acid-induced DNA damage checkpoint activation. Increased
  pCHK-1 foci during the pachytene stage (p < 0.0001). Arrows indicate pCHK-1 foci.
  Asterisks indicate statistical significance against the control group. Bar = 2 µm.
  (D) Linoleic acid-triggered apoptosis in germline nuclei similar to O. cornuta treatment
  (p < 0.0001). Other O. cornuta compounds did not show a simultaneous increase in
  both pCHK-1 foci and apoptosis. Asterisks indicate statistical significance against
  the control group. (E) The role of the MAPK pathway in the O. cornuta response validated
  by the mpk-1(ga111) mutant strain. Reduced survivability was reversed in the mutant
  (p = 0.4256 on day 5, p = 0.4208 on day 10 by the two-tailed t-test). Relative survivability
  is presented. Asterisks indicate statistical significance against the control group.
  (F) Suppressed apoptosis in the mpk-1 (ga111) mutant, supporting MAPK-dependent
  DNA damage pathway activation and survivability (p = 0.0173 in mpk-1 +O.c. and wild
  type +O.c.). Thymol (2 mM), dihydrotanshinone I (5 μM), luteolin (20 μM), linoleic
  acid (0.3 μM), and sugiol (10 μM) were employed in a qPCR study. O.c. extracts were
  introduced at a final concentration of 0.03 μg/mL Please refer to the Section 4
  for details. Arrows indicate nuclei undergoing apoptosis. Asterisks indicate statistical
  significance against the control group. Bar = 20 µm
