caption: Mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors (Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib)
  in treating castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). PARP inhibitors such as
  Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib block the PARP enzyme, which is crucial for repairing
  single-strand DNA breaks. Inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of single-strand
  breaks, which during DNA replication, result in double-strand breaks. Cells with
  BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibit homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). These
  cells are unable to efficiently repair double-strand breaks through the homologous
  recombination pathway. The accumulation of unrepaired double-strand breaks in HRD
  cells triggers cell death, effectively targeting cancer cells harboring BRCA mutations.
  This targeted approach exploits the inherent weaknesses in the DNA repair mechanisms
  of CRPC cells, providing a potent and specific strategy to combat this challenging
  form of cancer
