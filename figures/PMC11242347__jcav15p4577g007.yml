caption: EGR1 facilitated erastin-induced ferroptosis by activating Nrf2-HMOX1 signaling
  pathway. (A, B) LDH release levels in parental and EGR1-upregulated MDA-MB-231 and
  MDA-MB-468 cells treated with vehicle or erastin and the rescue assay with ZnPP.
  (C, D) GSH levels in parental and EGR1-upregulated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells
  treated with vehicle or erastin and the rescue assay with ZnPP. (E, F) MDA levels
  in parental and EGR1-upregulated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with vehicle
  or erastin and the rescue assay with ZnPP. (G, H) LIP levels in parental and EGR1-upregulated
  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with vehicle or erastin and the rescue assay
  with ZnPP. (I, J) Mitochondrial membrane potential levels in parental and EGR1-upregulated
  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with vehicle or erastin and the rescue assay
  with ZnPP
