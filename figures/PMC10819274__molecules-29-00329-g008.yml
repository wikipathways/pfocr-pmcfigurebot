caption: Microbiomics and untargeted metabolomics KEGG enrichment pathway analysis.
  (A) Microbiomics and identification of KEGG secondary metabolic pathway composition
  bar graphs for each sample. The vertical coordinates represent the relative abundance
  of each functional taxon; the longer the bar, the higher the relative abundance
  of that functional taxon in the corresponding sample. (B) Comparison group A-6d
  and D-6d KEGG pathway category bar graphs. G is Genetic Information Processing,
  M is Metabolism, E is Environmental Information Processing, o is Organismal Systems,
  H is Human Diseases. (C) Interaction maps of KEGG-enriched pathway-regulated metabolite
  networks shared by microbiomics and non-targeted metabolomics
