figure_title: Daphnoretin suppresses the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in vivo.
caption: 'Daphnoretin suppresses the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in vivo. (A) IHC staining
  with antibody against CD31, Ki-67, PCNA, p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT and AKT of tumor tissues.
  (B) The statistical results of positive areas. And the expressions of phosphorylated
  proteins are normalized to comparison with their non-phosphorylated counterparts.
  Scale bar = 50 μm. The data were expressed as mean ± SD. The experiment was repeated
  three times. After one-way analysis of variance and Tukey''s post-hoc test, compared
  with the control group: *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001'
