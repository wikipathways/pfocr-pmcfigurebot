caption: The roles of protein phosphatases in neural regeneration. PP6 promotes, but
  PTEN inhibits, neural regeneration through the mTOR/AKT/CREB signaling pathway.
  The receptor-type PTPs (RPTPs) act as the receptor of CSPG that has an inhibitory
  effect on axon growth and regeneration. PTPN2, a non-receptor PTP, hinders axon
  regeneration by suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway
