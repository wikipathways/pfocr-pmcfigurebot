caption: 'UA inhibited NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway via activating AMPK. (a) Molecular structure
  of UA. (b,c) The molecular docking models of UA with (b) AMPK-α1 and (c) AMPK-α2,
  respectively. The solid blue lines represent hydrogen bonds, the gray dotted lines
  represent hydrophobic effect, and the green dotted lines represent π-π stacking
  interaction. (d,e) Western blotting analysis for the protein expression of p-AMPK
  relative to β-actin in hPASMCs exposed to hypoxia with or without UA treatment (n
  = 6 per group). ** p < 0.01 compared to the control group, # p < 0.05 compared to
  the hypoxia group. (f,g) Western blotting analysis for the protein expression of
  p-AMPK relative to β-actin from lungs of mice exposed to normoxia (NOR) or hypoxia
  with UA (HX + UA) or vehicle (HX) treatment (n = 6 per group). ** p < 0.01 compared
  to the NOR group, # p < 0.05 compared to the HX group'
