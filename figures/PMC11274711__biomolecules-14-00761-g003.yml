caption: H3R-mediated intracellular signaling pathway and its regulation. H3R activation
  triggers signaling cascades via Gαi/o or Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric Gi/o protein
  to mediate intracellular response. Recruitment of β-arrestin1/2 to the GRK-phosphorylated
  H3R prevents further G protein coupling and directs the receptor towards internalization
  to prevent overstimulation
