figure_title: Purine metabolic pathway and major metabolites.
caption: Purine metabolic pathway and major metabolites. (A) Purine metabolic pathway;
  (B) metabolites in purine metabolic pathway. Blue words indicate the metabolites
  with significant differences between the inhibition group and the reduction group,
  green words indicate the metabolites with significant differences only in the inhibition
  group, and red words indicate the metabolites with significant differences only
  in the reduction group. ↑ indicates up-regulation and ↓ indicates down-regulation.
