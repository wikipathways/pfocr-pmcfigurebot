caption: GSEA was performed to analyze the signaling pathway enrichment in different
  groups. (A–C) GSEA bar plots at 30 °C, 22 °C, and 12 °C. (D–F) GSEA enrichment plots
  showing significant enrichment of the AMPK signaling pathway at 30 °C, 22 °C, and
  12 °C. (G–I) GSEA enrichment plots showing significant enrichment of the PPAR signaling
  pathway at 30 °C and 12 °C, and the adipocytokine signaling pathway at 22 °C
