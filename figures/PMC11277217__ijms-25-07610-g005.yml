figure_title: Palovarotene-induced changes in gene expression related to the interferon
  signaling pathway.
caption: Palovarotene-induced changes in gene expression related to the interferon
  signaling pathway. (A) Interactive diagram for the altered interferon signaling
  pathway in palovarotene-treated AcanCreER;Ext1f/f chondrocytes. (B–G) AcanCreER;Ext1f/f
  mice received palovarotene (Palovarotene, 1.76 mg/kg) (B–F) or corn oil (Control)
  (C–G) gavage daily for 3 days starting at 3.5 weeks of age after tamoxifen injections
  at P5 and P7. The forelimbs were then harvested. Coronal sections of the forelimbs
  were acquired and used for in situ hybridization for Cyp26b1 (B,C), Ifnar1 (D,E),
  or Ifngr1 (F,G). Bars denote 200 μm
