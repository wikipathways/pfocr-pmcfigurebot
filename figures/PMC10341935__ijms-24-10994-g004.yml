figure_title: Restraint stress alters gene expression in canonical signaling pathways
  and other biological functions.
caption: Restraint stress alters gene expression in canonical signaling pathways and
  other biological functions. (A) Heatmap of the microarray data displaying differentially
  expressed genes between controls and restraint hearts. Orange indicates high-expressing
  genes, whereas blue indicates low-expressing genes. (B) Pathway analysis of the
  differentially expressed genes. Stress leads to the upregulation of genes involved
  in a cytokine storm, healing (pulmonary healing signaling pathway), cell migration
  and growth (FAK signaling and HER-2 [breast cancer] signaling in cancer), neuroinflammation-related
  genes, and ferroptosis. Genes involved in ferroptosis include tumor protein p53
  (p53), solute carrier family 38 member 1 (Slc38A1), dexamethasone-induced Ras related
  1 (RasD1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (Cdkn1A or p21) and angiopoietin-like
  4 (Angptl4). Red indicates fold-change in restraint hearts (M vs. F) and green indicates
  fold-change in control hearts. Pathway and network analyses of the significant genes
  were conducted using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood
  City, CA, USA)
