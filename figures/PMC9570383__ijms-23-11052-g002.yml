caption: 'Metabolism of normal and tumor ECs. Graphical visualization of a normal
  and a tumor blood vessel with their metabolism. Normal vessels are characterized
  by a tightly adherent monolayer of ECs, intact basement membrane and rich pericyte
  coverage. Tumor vessels are lined by disorganized and structurally abnormal ECs
  and have a disturbed basement membrane with poor pericyte coverage, which leads
  to perturbed blood flow (shear stress) and allows cancer cells to enter the bloodstream.
  (a) Schematic representation of the main metabolic pathways in activated normal
  ECs (NECs). NECs are characterized by a high glycolytic flux, and use the oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP), serine synthesis pathway and glutamine metabolism
  for nucleotide and biomass production. Acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) contributes to sustaining the TCA cycle (in conjunction with anaplerotic substrates)
  for deoxynucleotide (dNTP) synthesis during stalk cell proliferation. NECs retain
  functional mitochondria and OXPHOS, though minimally for ATP synthesis; instead,
  mitochondrial complex III is essential for EC proliferation and is critical for
  the maintenance of the NAD+/NADH ratio. In lymphatic ECs (LECs), the ketone-body
  oxidation pathway (KBO) generates acetyl-CoA which enters the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle. (b) Quiescent ECs (QECs) display a lower rate of glycolysis, OXPHOS,
  fatty acid and nucleotide synthesis, and serine metabolism. They however increase
  FAO and oxPPP levels to regenerate NAPDH in order to maintain redox homeostasis
  and vascular barrier integrity. (c) Tumor ECs (TECs) are hyperglycolytic and have
  increased activity of the oxPPP, serine synthesis pathway, glutamine metabolism
  and FAO to sustain TEC proliferation. TECs can use glycogen as an alternative energy
  source and survive in nutrient-deprivation environments. In the figure, the arrow
  thickness represents the activity of the different metabolic pathways. (d) Activity
  of the selected pathways in activated NECs compared to TECs. Color code: the deeper
  the red, the higher the activity level of the metabolic pathway. Abbreviations:
