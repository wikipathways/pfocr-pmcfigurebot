caption: Proposed model illustrating the necessity of HSP60 in planarian regeneration
  and tissue homeostasis. (A) HSP60 functions in maintaining the integrity of mitochondria,
  which show distinct morphology and function in stem cells and intestinal cells.
  Intestinal cells depend on mitochondria to produce ATP for nutrient turnover, and
  to release nutrients for stem cells and other types of cells. Stem cells mainly
  depend on glycolysis to produce ATP for genes transcription and protein synthesis,
  and also depend on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to produce nucleotides for
  DNA replication. Mitochondria in stem cells are related to maintaining pluripotency.
  (B) Intestinal branches can extend to the tip of planarian head. Activating and
  releasing of cathepsin L from intestinal cells induced by RNAi-Djhsp60 may be the
  reason for head regression.
