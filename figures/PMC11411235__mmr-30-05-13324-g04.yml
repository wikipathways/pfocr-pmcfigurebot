figure_title: Functions of tetraspanins in CRC.
caption: 'Functions of tetraspanins in CRC. (A) Tetraspanins promoting CRC progression:
  (a) RNAi-mediated suppression of TSPAN1 effectively hinders the growth and infiltration
  of colon cancer cells. (b) TSPAN8, EpCAM, claudin-7 and CD44v6 are co-expressed
  in CRC tissues, forming a complex that inhibits apoptosis. Silencing TSPAN8 strengthens
  the binding ability of integrin α3β1 and integrin α5β1, inhibits CD44 and reduces
  CRC cell migration. TSPAN8 directly interacts with E-cadherin and targeting this
  interaction may hinder tumor progression. (c) EVs isolated from the supernatants
  of CRC cell lines contain significantly elevated levels of TSPAN9, ADAM10 and CD59.
  Higher levels of EV TSPAN9 promote the metastasis of CRC cells. (d) TSPAN5 may promote
  the development of CRC by activating the Notch signaling pathway. The proliferation,
  migration and invasion of CRC cells are inhibited by siRNAs that suppress the expression
  of TSPAN5. (e) TSPAN12 promotes CRC cell growth, proliferation, migration and invasion.
  (B) Tetraspanins suppressing CRC progression: (a) Deletion of the TSPAN6 gene activates
  the EGF signaling pathway, leading to an increase in CRC tumor size. (b) Increased
  adhesion of TSPAN29 and integrin β1 to CRC cells and inhibition of TNFα expression
  contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation. (c) The 90K-TSPAN27/TSPAN29
  complex inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC, thereby suppressing CRC progression.
