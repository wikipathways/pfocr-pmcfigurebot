caption: Overview of the PD-1 and PD-L1 checkpoints and signaling pathways associated
  with them. The presentation of antigen by MHC on APCs to the TCR complex on T cells
  activates T cells via the Zap70 and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. CD28 on T cells
  binds to CD80/86 on APCs to provide co-stimulatory signals. PD-1/PD-L and CTLA-4
  signaling suppress the AKT signaling pathway to limit T cell activation. CTLA-4
  suppresses the AKT pathway directly by recruiting PP2A, while PD-1 signaling includes
  SHP-mediated regulation of Zap20 and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Green lines
  indicate stimulatory messages, while red lines represent inhibitory ones. ITSM and
  ITIM are intracellular domains of immunological checkpoints that are responsible
  for intracellular signaling. APC, antigen presenting cell; TCR, T cell receptor;
  MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD-1, programmed death-1; CTLA4, cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte antigen-4; ZAP70, zeta chain of T cell receptor associated protein
  kinase 70; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3 kinase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase; AKT, protein kinase
  B; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif; ITSM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  motif; SHP, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase.
