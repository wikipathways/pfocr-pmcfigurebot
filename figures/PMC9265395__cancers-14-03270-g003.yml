caption: Multiple functions of KDM5A in cancer. (A) In pRb-deficient cells, KDM5A
  promotes tumorigenesis by cell cycle progression and differentiation block. (B)
  KDM5A and MYC coordinately promote tumorigenesis by activating MYC target gene expression.
  (C) KDM5A and RBP-J promote small cell lung cancer (SCLC) by inducing the expression
  of neuroendocrine genes through the repression of Notch target genes. (D) NUP98–KDM5A
  induces leukemogenesis by activating the expression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated
  transcription factors (TFs) and CDK6, as well as the JAK-STAT pathway. (E) KDM5A
  confers drug resistance by chromatin alterations. (F) KDM5A elevates PDL1 expression
  by activating the PI3K–AKT–S6K1 cascade through the downregulation of PTEN.
