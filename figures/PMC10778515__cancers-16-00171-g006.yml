caption: A schematic representation of the Rap1 signaling pathway. The growth factors
  FGF1, NGF, and VEGF act as external signals which bind to their receptors (FGFR,
  TrkA, and KDR) located in the cell membrane. This promotes autophosphorylation of
  the tyrosine domains within the cytosolic site of receptors. These domains are then
  bound by an adaptor protein, growth factor receptor-bound protein (GRB), which in
  turn binds to the son of sevenless (SOS) protein. The activated SOS protein will
  now promote the exchange of GDP, bound to the NRAS protein, to GTP. Activated NRAS
  will result in the subsequent activation of the downstream signal components of
  MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathway proteins. Ultimately, this will result in the activation
  of transcription factors such as Myc, Fos, and Jun in the nucleus, resulting in
  the regulation of gene expression. The figure was created with BioRender.com (accessed
