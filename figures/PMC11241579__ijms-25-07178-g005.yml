figure_title: FAN inhibits ASFV replication by suppressing the AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway.
caption: FAN inhibits ASFV replication by suppressing the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
  PAMs were treated with different concentrations of FAN (A) or 1 μM MK2206 (MK, a
  specific AKT inhibitor) (C) or 5 μM rapamycin (RARP, a mTORC1 inhibitor) (E) for
  24 h, or infected with 0.1 MOI ASFV for 2 h, followed by treatment with FAN (B)
  or 1 μM MK2206 (D) or 5 μM rapamycin (F). The cells were collected at 24 h post
  compound treatment, and the indicated proteins were detected by Western blot
