caption: Cross-talk between EGR and type I interferon signaling. The binding of ligands
  with EGF receptors initiates cell proliferation and suppresses the innate immune
  response. After binding the ligand, HER2 molecules are embedded in the vesicle by
  endocytosis and transfer to the Golgi complex. Then they inhibit STING, which is
  a key stimulator of type I interferon gene transcription via IRF3. Treatment with
  EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib, inhibits HER2 receptors and suppresses the STING
  activation, further increasing the innate immunity response (a left part of the
  scheme based on results shown elsewhere [,]). In addition to inhibition of type
  interferon production, EGF receptor signaling may attenuate type I interferon signaling
  from its receptors, changing the ratio between active forms of STAT1 and STAT3,
  the latter being considered as inhibiting the main response pathway based on activated
  STAT1 dimer (right part of the scheme based on results from []).
