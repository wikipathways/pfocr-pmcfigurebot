caption: Comparison of transcriptome analysis results between rip5-ko and ZH11 plants
  under PEG stress. (A) Volcano plot of DEGs that were differentially expressed between
  ZH11_PEG and rip5-ko-PEG. The red dots on the right of the plot represent significantly
  up-regulated genes, the blue dots on the left of the plot represent significantly
  down-regulated genes, and the black dots in the middle of the plot represent genes
  that did not show significant differential expression. (B) KEGG metabolic pathway
  enrichment analysis comparing DEGs between ZH11_PEG and rip5-ko_PEG samples. (C)
  GO functional classification enrichment analysis comparing DEGs between ZH11_PEG
  and rip5-ko_PEG samples
