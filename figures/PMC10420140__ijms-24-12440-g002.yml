caption: Potential mechanisms of irisin in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies
  have shown that irisin, which is a hormone stimulated via physical exercise derived
  from the precursor protein fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5),
  is reduced in the brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of humans with AD. The AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) is a key pathway in autophagy. Irisin can modulate this pathway
  by activating the AMPK pathway and inhibiting mTOR, thus leading to the increase
  in autophagy and the clearance of amyloid and toxic aggregates in the brain. Irisin
  can decrease pro-apoptotic Bad, Bax and caspase-3, and caspase 9 while increasing
  anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl through the ERK signaling pathway. Irisin
  demonstrates the inhibition of the necroptotic signaling pathway through increasing
  BDNF (which increases neurogenesis), mitigating the impact of HMGB1 and suppressing
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) mRNA expression. It can also inhibit p38, STAT3, and
  NFκB, reducing neuroinflammation
