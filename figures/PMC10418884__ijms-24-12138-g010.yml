figure_title: The regulatory pathway of GR.
caption: 'The regulatory pathway of GR. Cav−1: caveolin−1; Src: steroid receptor coactivator;
  STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; BTM: Basal transcription
  machinery; GR regulates gene expression through three mechanisms. (a) Direct-activated
  GR binds directly to GREs or ngREs on DNA; (b) Tethering—GR acts by bundling with
  other DNA−binding transcription factors; (c) Composite—GR binds directly to DNA
  and interacts with adjacent DNA-binding transcription factors'
