caption: Metabolic pathway analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites in
  GY-RG vs. GY-CG (a) and GC-RG vs. GC-CG (b). In (a,b), the red dotted line indicates
  a p-value of 0.01, and the blue dotted line indicates a p-value of 0.05. The color
  of the bar graph from light to dark indicates that the p-value decreases in order,
  and when the top of the bar is higher than the blue line, a pathway is considered
  to be significant
