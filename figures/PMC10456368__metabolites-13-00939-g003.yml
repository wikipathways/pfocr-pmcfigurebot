caption: Nuclear PTEN regulates pyrimidine metabolism, specifically de novo dTMP biosynthesis
  through interaction with MTHFD1. (A,B) Over-representation analysis of significantly
  changed metabolites in nuclear PTEN-overexpressed PC3 (A) and C4-2 (B) cells, compared
  to its control counterpart. Note that pyrimidine metabolism is the most significantly
  enriched metabolic pathway in both nuclear PTEN-overexpressed PC3 and C4-2 cells.
  (C,D) Heatmap (C) and bar graph (D) showing the relative abundance of various significantly
  altered metabolites in the pyrimidine metabolic pathway in nuclear PTEN-overexpressed
  PC3 cells. (E,F) Heatmap (E) and bar graph (F) showing the relative abundance of
  various significantly altered metabolites in the pyrimidine metabolic pathway in
  nuclear PTEN-overexpressed C4-2 cells. (G) Bar graph showing the relative abundance
  of dTMP and its immediate downstream metabolites in both nuclear PTEN-overexpressed
  PC3 and C4-2 cells. (H) Co-immunoprecipitation of PTEN and MTHFD1 in Wt and nuclear
  PTEN-overexpressed PC3 cells using control IgG and PTEN antibody. Input is 10% of
  total cell extracts used for immunoprecipitation. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001. All data are mean Â± SD from n = 3 biological replicates
