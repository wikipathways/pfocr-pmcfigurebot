figure_title: Cell-cell communications between patients with remission-low and moderate-high
  disease activity and matched controls
caption: (A) Heatmap representing the relative number of interactions between RA and
  matched controls. (B) Bar plot illustrates statistically significant communication
  pathways based on the weight of interactions between patients with RA and controls.
  (C) Dot plot of the relative contribution of communication pathways based on weight
  of interactions between high and low disease activity compared with controls. (D)
  Heatmaps of the relative importance of cells as senders and receivers for the IFN-II,
  the VEGF, and the NT signaling pathway network in high and low disease activity.
  (E) Circle plots representing the relative importance of cells as senders and receivers
  for the VISTA signaling pathway network in high and low disease activity and overall.
  CD, cluster differentiation; IFIT, IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats;
