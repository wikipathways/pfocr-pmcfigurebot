caption: The effect of tephrosin on downregulation of the FGFR1/FRS2 signaling pathway
  in SKOV3-TR cells. (A) Cells were treated with DMSO (mock), paclitaxel (200 nM),
  tephrosin (10 µM), combination treatment with paclitaxel and tephrosin, BGJ398 (2
  µM), and combination treatment with paclitaxel and BGJ398. After 48 h of treatment,
  immunoblotting was performed to determine the expressions of FGFR1, FRS2, EGFR,
  and their phosphorylation forms. The expression of cleaved PARP showed apoptotic
  cell death for each treatment condition. (B) SKOV3-TR cells were treated with paclitaxel
  (200 nM) with dose-different combinations of tephrosin (0, 1, 5, and 10 µM) for
  48 h. In addition, cells were treated with tephrosin (10 µM) with dose-different
  combinations of paclitaxel (0, 1, 10, 100, and 200 nM). The expressions of FGFR1,
  FRS2, and their phosphorylation forms were analyzed using immunoblotting. Protein
  expression levels were quantified relative to the control, following normalization
  to the corresponding expression of actin using ImageJ software. (C) Cells were treated
  with paclitaxel and tephrosin, as shown in Figure 3A, and the mRNA expressions of
  FGFR1 and FRS2 were analyzed using RT-PCR tests. GAPDH was used as a loading control.
  (D) Relative quantifications of FGFR1 and FRS2 were analyzed using RT-qPCR tests,
  and the mRNA relative expression was normalized using GAPDH. Significant differences
  were calculated using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). p > 0.05 indicated
  no significant (ns) difference. PTX, paclitaxel; Teph, tephrosin; BGJ, BGJ398
