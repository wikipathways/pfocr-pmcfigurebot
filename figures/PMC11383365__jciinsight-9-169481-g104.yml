figure_title: PFKFB3 is upregulated in AP and SAP
caption: '(A) Pancreatic tissues were collected 10 or 22 hours after injection of
  saline or caerulein (CAE), followed RNA-Seq (the National Genomics Data Center Accession
  no. CRA002365). Heatmap shows differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of HIF1 signaling
  pathway in CAE-AP model. (B–D) Western blotting and qPCR detected the PFKFB3 level
  in CAE-AP (B), FAEE-SAP (C) and NaTc-SAP (D) models. (E–J) IHC analysis of PFKFB3
  in pancreas from control group (n = 5) and CAE-AP (E), FAEE-SAP (F), and NaTc-SAP
  (G) models (n = 5). Quantification of PFKFB3 intensity in 3 AP models is shown in
  H–J, respectively. Scale bar: 200 μm. (K and L) IHC analysis of PFKFB3 in pancreas
  from patients with AP or SAP (n = 5). Scale bar: 80 μm. (M) PFKFB3 levels were detected
  using Western blotting in AR42J cells treated with TNFA (80 ng/mL; 6 hours) and
  CoCl2 (200 μmol/L; 6 hours). P values calculated using unpaired Student’s t test.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Error bars show mean ± SD. Each experiment
  was performed at least in triplicate'
