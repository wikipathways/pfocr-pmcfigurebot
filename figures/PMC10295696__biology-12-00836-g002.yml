caption: Overview of the carbohydrate and glycan metabolic pathways of the Achatina
  fulica snail reconstructed by the genomic contig data and functionally annotated
  based on the KEGG pathway database followed by three-step manual curation to fill
  the additional enzymes into the missing gaps. The interaction graph indicates the
  enzymes with solid dots, the enzymatic direction with arrows, pathway annotation
  with different colours, intermediates or metabolites with black characters, and
  enzyme names with coloured abbreviated names. Text labels show the pathway names
