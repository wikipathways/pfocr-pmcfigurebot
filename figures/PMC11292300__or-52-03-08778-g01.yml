caption: Schematic representation of the WNT signaling pathway in CMTC. (A) In normal
  thyroid cells, the canonical (β-catenin-dependent) WNT signaling is in the ‘off’
  state because the APC protein, together with the scaffolding protein Axin, serine/threonine
  kinases CK1 and GSK3β, and β-catenin, form a ‘destruction complex’ that phosphorylates
  β-catenin, thus promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. (B) In
  CMTC cells, different somatic mutations in APC, CTNNB1 and/or AXIN1 genes alter
  the destruction complex, impairing β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation in
  the proteasome. β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and subsequently translocates
  to the nucleus, where it binds to the TCF/LEF family to activate the transcription
  of target genes involved in proliferation and loss of differentiation, such as MYC
  and CCND1. (C) Localization of β-catenin in CMTC. Tumor cells (right) show characteristic
  nuclear and cytoplasmic positivity for β-catenin, while non-tumor cells (left) show
  membrane positivity with discrete cytoplasmic immunostaining (original magnification,
  ×400). CMTC, cribriform morular thyroid carcinoma; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor; CCND1, cyclin D1; APC, APC regulator of WNT signaling pathway;
  CK1, casein kinase 1; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; DVL, disheveled; CBP,
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element binding protein 1 binding protein;
  LRP5/6, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6
