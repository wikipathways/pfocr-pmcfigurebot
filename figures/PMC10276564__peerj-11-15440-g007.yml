figure_title: Scatterplot of enriched KEGG pathways for DEGs under drought stress.
  Only the top 20 most strongly of I. bungeana leaf and root represented pathways
  are displayed
caption: Each circle/triangle in the figure represents a KEGG pathway, the ordinate
  represents the name of the pathway, and the abscissa is the enrichment factor. The
  size of the circle represents the number of genes enriched in the pathway. The larger
  the number, the more genes.The larger the enrichment factor, the more significant
  the enrichment level of differentially expressed genes in this pathway. The color
  of the circle/triangle represents the q value, which is the P-value after correction
  for multiple hypothesis testing. The smaller the q value, the more reliable the
  enrichment significance of the differentially expressed genes in the pathway.
