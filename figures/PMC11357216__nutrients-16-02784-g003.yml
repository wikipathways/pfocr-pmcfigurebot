  and reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm).
caption: RSJ regulates the expression of the proteins in the mitochondrial pathway
  and reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). (A,B) Western blotting detected
  the expression of apoptosis-related proteins following RSJ treatment in the BC cells.
  (C–E) The alteration in ΔΨm in the BC cells after RSJ treatment was detected by
  measuring fluorescence (scale bar = 100 μm)
