caption: 'Model depicting the mechanisms by which glucose controls glucagon release.
  Glucose controls glucagon release by multiple mechanisms (inhibitory: red bars;
  stimulatory: green arrows). Increasing the glucose concentration exerts two opposite
  effects on α-cell [Ca2+]c. It decreases [Ca2+]c independently of α-cell KATP channels
  (1) and partly via SST (2). It also increases [Ca2+]c at glucose concentrations
  that stimulate insulin secretion. This latter effect likely results from electrical
  coupling which could be direct between β- and α-cells (3), or indirect and involve
  δ-cells (4). This stimulatory effect on α-cells is counteracted by SST which hyperpolarizes
  α-cells and keeps α-cell at low levels (2). Hence, it can only be observed in the
  absence of paracrine influence of SST. All glucose-induced changes in α-cell [Ca2+]c
  induce parallel changes in glucagon release. In addition, glucose decreases the
  efficacy of α-cell Ca2+ on exocytosis by an attenuating pathway that is opposite
  to the amplifying pathway of glucose in β-cells. As previously shown [], SST released
  from δ-cells in response to glucose also contributes to the inhibitory effect of
  glucose by inhibiting the efficacy of Ca2+ on exocytosis (6). KATP, ATP-sensitive
  K+; VGCC, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels; SST, somatostatin; SSTR: somatostatin receptor;
  KSST, Hyperpolarizing K+ channel activated by SST (GIRK or another type).'
