figure_title: Genome-wide CRISPRi screens of breast cancer associated enhancers
caption: 'a. Schematic overview of this study using single-cell CRISPRi screen to
  connect variant-associated enhancers with downstream gene targets and pathways.b.
  (Left) ATAC-seq signals of all 8 breast cancer cell lines across 3,512 perturbation
  regions. Cell lines colored in blue indicate the subtype of ER positive, and cell
  lines in orange indicate the subtype of ER negative. (Right) Schematic illustration
  of filtering the non-coding regulatory elements with breast cancer variants and
  epigenetic markers.c. (Upper) The H3K27ac signals of (ER+) MDA-MB-361 cells across
  3,512 perturbation regions. (Lower) The localization of somatic mutations in the
  perturbation regions.d. Genome browser shots of perturbation regions prioritized
  by GWAS and somatic mutations (SM).e. Single-cell CRISPRi screen overview and key
  statistics. sgRNA libraries were packaged into lentivirus to infect the breast cancer
  cells. We sequenced 558,137 cells from (ER+) MDA-MB-361 and (ER−) MDA-MB-231 cell
  lines and generated single-cell transcriptome and perturbation data.f. sgRNAs targeting
  CHGB enhancers demonstrate 81% of repression in (ER+) MDA-MB-361 cells, indicating
  robust CRISPRi in (ER+) MDA-MB-361 cells. (Raw p-value, Student’s t-test). (Box
  plot: center line, median; box limits, top and bottom 10%; whiskers, 1.5x interquartile
  range; points, outlier).g. The UMAP plot of somatic mutation perturbation modules
  in (ER+) MDA-MB-361.h. The UMAP plot of gene programs.i. (Upper left) The normalized
  expression heatmap arranged by perturbation modules and gene programs. (Upper right)
  Correlation coefficient heatmap of gene programs indicates high similarity within
  the same gene program. (Lower) Correlation coefficient heatmap of perturbation modules
  confirms that enhancers within the same module share a similar expression pattern.j.
  Functional annotation of each gene program identified by GSEA.k. Schematic overview
  of the pySpade package to identify direct and indirect gene targets from CRISPRi-mediated
  repression of enhancers. To reduce false positives, we modeled background distributions
  by random simulation. The figure illustrates an example of how MT2A promoter perturbation
  impacts MT2A expression. We compare the MT2A expression level of cells with MT2A
  promoter sgRNAs to all the other cells by hypergeometric test. We implement a background
  correction strategy, that randomly selects cells 1,000 times from the population
  and calculates the p-value of MT2A expression level comparing random selected cells
  and other cells. Based on the background distribution and observation p-value, we
  calculate the empirical p-value and adjusted p-value'
