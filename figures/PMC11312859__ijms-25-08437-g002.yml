figure_title: IL-18 synthesis and signaling.
caption: 'IL-18 synthesis and signaling. Top: Lipopolysaccharide and IFN induce the
  synthesis of pro-IL-18 and IL-18BP. Concurrently, the inflammasome activates pro-caspase-1
  into caspase-1, which cleaves pro-IL-18 into IL-18. Additionally, caspase-1 cleaves
  gasdermin D (GSDMD) into N-GSDMD, forming pores through which IL-18 is released
  from the cells. Bottom: Once secreted into the extracellular space, IL-18 can bind
  to its receptor (IL-18R) or to IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). Binding to IL-18BP
  inhibits IL-18 signaling, whereas binding to IL-18R initiates the signaling cascade.
  The cytosolic domain of IL-18R contains a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain that recruits
  Myd88, facilitating the recruitment of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). IRAK
  then associates with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which in turn binds
  to the kinase TAK1. TAK1 phosphorylates and activates NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK).
  Activated NIK then activates the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates
  IkB, leading to IkB ubiquitination and rapid degradation. This process liberates
  the NF-κB transcription factor, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus, where
  it binds to κB sites in the promoter regions of inflammatory genes. Moreover, TRAF6
  phosphorylation also connects with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) through
  TAK1, activating downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways,
  including p38 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B (PI3K/AKT), and extracellulart signal-regulated kinase (ERK). This cascade
  culminates in the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor. Created with biorender.com.
