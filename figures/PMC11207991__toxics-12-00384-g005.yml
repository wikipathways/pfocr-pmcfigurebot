caption: 'Summary plot of metabolic pathway analysis of eOPFRs treatments performed
  on A549 cells: (A) control group vs. CDP treatments; (B) control group vs. RDP treatments;
  (C) control group vs. TAP treatments; and (D) control group vs. PEPA treatments.
  (a) D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism; (b) glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism;
  (c) alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; (d) arginine and proline metabolism;
  (e) arginine biosynthesis; (f) glutathione metabolism; (g) glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
  metabolism; (h) inositol phosphate metabolism; (i) phenylalanine, tyrosine, and
  tryptophan biosynthesis; (j) phenylalanine metabolism; and (k) cysteine and methionine
  metabolism'
