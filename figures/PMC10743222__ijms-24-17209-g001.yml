  worms.
caption: Activation of the mitochondrial MAPK (MAPKmt) signaling pathway in lonp-1-deficient
  worms. (A) Schematic representation of the MAPKmt pathway consisting of the DLK-1/SEK-3/PMK-3
  kinase cascade and the downstream target gene, tbb-6. (B) Relative mRNA quantification
  of endogenous tbb-6 gene expression levels in wt and lonp-1-knockout (ko) mutants.
  (C) Representative microscopy images and GFP fluorescence quantification of the
  tbb-6p::gfp reporter in wt and lonp-1(ko) worms. (D,E) Quantification of endogenous
  tbb-6 gene expression or the tbb-6p::gfp reporter in wt and lonp-1(ko) mutants upon
  disruption of the MAPKmt signaling components. Experiments were performed on 1-day-old
  adult worms grown on NGM plates, seeded with E. coli OP50 or with E. coli HT115
  bacteria transformed with the indicated RNAi construct (and empty vector as a control)
  at 20 °C. Scale bar indicates 100 µm. Values are presented as means ± SEM, and asterisks
  denote statistical significance assessed with an unpaired Student’s t-test or with
  a two-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey’s test, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001,
  **** p ≤ 0.0001
