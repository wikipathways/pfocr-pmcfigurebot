caption: 'TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
  (A,B) Heatmaps illustrating the expression profile of significantly increased (in
  red) or decreased (in green) enzymes (ANOVA and Tukey’s test, p-value < 0.05) involved
  in TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation (A), and oxidative phosphorylation (B) pathways.
  (C) Graphical representation of metabolic canonical pathways: activated (z-score
  > 2; orange arrows) or inhibited (z-blue < 2; blue arrows) in muscles attached to
  inflamed tendons, without (COL) and with PEMF treatment (PEMF). (D) Heatmap displaying
  the expression profile of enzymes involved in the NAD signaling pathway. (E) Heatmap
  presenting the most significant upstream regulators. Orange- and blue-colored rectangles
  indicate predicted regulator activation or inhibition, respectively, via the z-score
  statistic. (F,G) Bar graphs depicting the expression of Yes-Associated Protein (YAP)
  (F) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1alpha)
  (G) in the gastrocnemius muscle from PBS, COL, and COL + PEMF groups (mean ± SD;
  * = significant difference, ANOVA and Tukey’s test, n = 2, * p-value < 0.05; **
  p-value < 0.01; *** p-value < 0.001). Full-length images are available in Supplementary
  Figure S1. The graphical illustration was generated using BioRender (version 4)'
