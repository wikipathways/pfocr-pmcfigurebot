caption: 'Sodium selenite induces autophagy and apoptosis via mitochondrial ROS. (A,B)
  After Mito Q pretreatment, mtROS levels were detected by confocal microscopy (A,
  magnification Ã—200) and quantified by flow cytometry (B) in HeLa cells. Changes
  in cell proliferation (C), the percentage of apoptotic cells (D), and the percentage
  of MDC-positive cells (E) were measured in HeLa and SiHa cells. (F) Expression levels
  of AMPK/mTOR/FOXO3a pathway proteins, as well as autophagy and apoptosis proteins
  in HeLa cells. All results were repeated at least three times. # indicates statistical
  significance compared to the control group, ns: p > 0.05, #### p < 0.0001; * indicates
  statistical significance compared to the SS treatment group, **** p < 0.0001. Con:
  Control; SS: sodium selenite; Mito Q: Mitoquinone mesylate; c-PARP: cleaved-PARP;
  c-caspase3: cleaved-caspase3'
