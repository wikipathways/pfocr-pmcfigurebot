figure_title: Functions of tetraspanins in liver cancer.
caption: 'Functions of tetraspanins in liver cancer. (A) Tetraspanins promoting HCC
  progression: (a) TSPAN15 enhances ERK phosphorylation and ADAM10 secretion, controls
  CTGF expression and secretion and promotes HCC cell proliferation. (b) miR-135b
  targets TSPAN31, increasing CDK4 protein levels, which promotes HCC cell invasion
  and migration. (c) TSPAN8 promotes HCC cell metastasis by inducing ADAM12. (d) TSPAN24/CD151
  induces metastasis through integrin β1, induces MMP9 expression, promotes cancer
  cell migration and contributes to angiogenesis and HCC metastasis. (e) TSPAN30/CD63
  activates the TGF-β and FAK-Akt signaling pathways by binding to TIMP-1, promoting
  HCC cell migration and survival. (f) TSPAN5 activation of Notch signaling enhances
  EMT-promoted metastasis in tumor cells. (g) TSPAN1 regulates HCC cell proliferation
  by targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway. (B) Tetraspanins suppressing HCC progression:
  (a) TSPAN27 binds to integrins and E-cadherin, affecting the invasive and metastatic
  potential of HCC cells. (b) TSPAN29/CD9 blocks the activation of JNK and c-JUN,
  leading to the inhibition of HCC cell proliferation in vitro. (c) TSPAN7/CD231 upregulation
  suppresses the growth of HCC cells. HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; TSPAN, tetraspanin;
