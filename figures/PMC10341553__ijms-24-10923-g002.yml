figure_title: LPS challenge dynamically induces inflammatory response and activates
  muscle protein degradation signaling pathway in weanling pigs.
caption: 'LPS challenge dynamically induces inflammatory response and activates muscle
  protein degradation signaling pathway in weanling pigs. Longissimus dorsi muscle
  samples were collected from the control group (0 h after injection of saline) and
  LPS-treated groups (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after injection of LPS). (A–G) mRNA
  levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and the
  key components of muscle protein degradation signaling pathway (including Akt, FOXO1,
  MuRF1, and MAFbx). (H) Representative image of t-Akt, p-Akt, t-FOXO1, and p-FOXO1
  protein expression. (I–N) Protein expression of t-Akt, p-Akt, t-FOXO1, and p-FOXO1.
  Data are presented as means ± SEM, n = 6. *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05,
  and # 0.05 < p < 0.10, different from the control group (0 h)'
