caption: Schematic representation of the roles of FER in auxin-induced cell elongation
  and root hair growth. Two pathways have been reported to depict the roles of FER
  in auxin-induced root hair growth. In the first one, in the right side of the figure,
  FER regulates NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS accumulation through RAC/ROP to participate
  in auxin-induced root hair growth []. Specifically, the FER–ROPGEF module preferentially
  binds RAC/ROP in a GDP-dependent manner; upon signal activation, activated GTP-bound
  RAC/ROPs interact with NADPH oxidase to mediate ROS production, leading to root
  hair growth []. Additionally, LLG1 is a key component of the FER–ROPGEF–RAC/ROP
  signaling complex []. In the second pathway, on the left side of the figure, auxin
  regulates cell elongation by modulating the apoplast acidification in a FER-dependent
  manner. Specifically by binding its RALF ligand, FER induces phosphorylation of
  plasma membrane-localized H+-ATPase to inhibit proton transportation into the apoplast
  [].
