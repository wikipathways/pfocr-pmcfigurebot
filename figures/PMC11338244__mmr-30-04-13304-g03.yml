caption: Effects of methylation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway on tamoxifen.
  The methylation-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway leads
  to tamoxifen resistance. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol

  complex; mTORC1, target of rapamycin complex 1; H3K4, histone H3 lysine 4; MLL,
  mixed-lineage leukemia protein; SALL2, Sal-like protein 2; ZDHHC22, Zinc finger
  DHHC-type containing 22; METTL3, methyltransferase-like 3; AK4, adenylate kinase
