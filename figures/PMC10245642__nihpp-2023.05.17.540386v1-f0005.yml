figure_title: CYCLOPS clock magnitude varies in Luminal A samples, correlates with
  EMT, and predicts prognosis
caption: (A) Cartoon depicting CYCLOPS sample magnitude. CYLOPS projects the n-dimensional
  eigengene expression of each sample to a plane where the circular data structure
  is apparent. The angular position of any sample in the reconstructed circle reflects
  its circadian phase. The distance from the circle’s center to a given sample is
  the sample’s CYCLOPS magnitude (dotted line). This distance is a weighted sum of
  the amplitudes of individually cycling seed genes.(B) Histogram of Luminal A CYCLOPS
  sample magnitudes colored by tertiles (N = 70). The distribution shows a long tail.(C)
  A histogram of transcript amplitude ratios comparing samples from the top-third
  and bottom-third magnitude groups. Nested cosinor regression models assessed the
  significance of including CYCLOPS sample magnitude in fitting transcript rhythms.
  Transcripts that showed differential cycling by CYCLOPS magnitude group were identified
  (BHq <0.05). For differentially cycling transcripts the amplitude of cycling in
  the highest tertile was compared to the amplitude of cycling in the lowest tertile.(D)
  Batch normalized expression data are shown for representative core clock transcripts
  that exhibit differential cycling between magnitude groups (BHq <0.05). Luminal
  A samples in the top tertile of CYCLOPS magnitude are shown in red and the bottom
  two tertiles in blue. The best-fit sinusoid is superimposed for each group. Significance
  was assessed by nested cosinor regression.(E) The CYCLOPS estimated phase of Luminal
  A tumor samples is plotted against the matched non-cancerous samples for the small
  number of matched samples in TCGA. Samples are colored by CYCLOPS magnitude group,
  distinguishing the top tertile from the bottom two tertiles.(F) Five-year patient
  mortality grouped by tumor CYCLOPS magnitude group. Patient outcome data were obtained
  from the TCGA database. For each tertile/magnitude group, the percentage of patients
  who died within 5 years of diagnosis is shown. The increased risk in the high-magnitude
  tumor group remained statistically significant when evaluated in a logistic regression
  model that included patient age and the presence of known metastasis at diagnosis
  (chisq p<0.05).(G) MSigDB Hallmark gene sets overrepresented among transcripts that
  showed differential cycling among Luminal A magnitude groups are shown. Transcripts
  showing differential cycling in Luminal A magnitude groups (BHq < 0.05) were input
  to EnrichR, and overrepresented gene sets were identified. Similarly, all transcripts
  cycling in Luminal A tumors were ranked by the ratio of transcript amplitude in
  the highest tertile compared to the lowest. GSEA was used to identify MSigDB Hallmark
  gene sets enriched in the ranked list. The -log(BHq) from the EnrichR analysis is
  plotted against the normalized enrichment score (NES) from GSEA. Both methods identify
  the “Epithelial-mesenchymal transition” gene set as most impacted by differential
  cycling in the high magnitude group.(H) Batch normalized expression data for selected
  transcripts in the Epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway exhibit differential
  cycling (BHq <0.05). Luminal A samples in the top tertile of CYCLOPS magnitude are
  shown in red and the bottom two tertiles in blue. The best-fit sinusoid is superimposed
  for each condition.
