figure_title: Auxin-regulated TFRN attenuates lignin biosynthesis.
caption: 'Auxin-regulated TFRN attenuates lignin biosynthesis. Green boxes stand for
  the substrates/products of the reactions involved in lignin biosynthesis. Green
  arrows denote chemical transformations. Orange and violet filled boxes present the
  genes encoding lignin biosynthesis enzymes and their regulators, respectively. First,
  p-Coumaric acid is transformed into several p-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA thioesters (highlighted
  in pastel mint), which are interconverted by CCoAOMT and F5H. Second, p-hydroxycinnamoyl
  CoA thioesters are transformed to p-hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes (highlighted in light
  green) by CCR, which are further converted to p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols (monolignols)
  (highlighted in aquamarine) by CAD. p-hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes and monolignols
  interconversion is provided by COMT and F5H. Finally, monolignols polymerize into
  lignin. UGT72B1 catalyzes monolignol conjugate formation, and BGLU45 and BGLU46
  promote their deconjugation. Laccases, peroxidases and ESB1 enable monolignols’
  polymerization to lignin and its deposition. TFRN is represented by its interconnected
  US–DA part supplemented with the free-standing US NAM, which is a regulator of two
  dDEGs encoding lignin biosynthesis enzymes. The numbers in blue boxes mark the steps
  in the lignin biosynthesis pathway (only the ones affected by USes/DAs are represented).
  Next to a TF, these numbers indicate that the TF regulates lignin biosynthesis genes
  at the corresponding step. A “plus” sign in a blue box denotes entering of an additional
  chain of reactions to the main one. Asterisks point out the genes activated by MYB63
  [57]. US, upregulated suppressor; DA, downregulated activator. Abbreviations for
  the lignin biosynthesis genes (or genes/enzymes if gene and enzyme names differ):
