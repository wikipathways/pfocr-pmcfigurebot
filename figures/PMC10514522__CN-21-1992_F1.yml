caption: Activation pathways of microglia in SAE and their neurotoxicity. ① During
  sepsis, peripheral inflammatory cells release large amounts of inflammatory factors
  in response to pathogen stimulation. These inflammatory factors and pathogen components
  (such as LPS) can act on endothelial cells of the BBB through blood circulation,
  leading to endothelial cell activation. ② Activated endothelial cells can produce
  large amounts of inflammatory cytokines acting on the CNS. At the same time, peripheral
  inflammatory stimulation can also cause endothelial cell apoptosis, resulting in
  BBB destruction and increased permeability, and peripheral inflammatory factors
  can thus cross the BBB into the brain, causing astrocyte and microglia activation.
  ③ Homeostatic microglia are transformed into the M1 phenotype by inflammatory signals
  and release large amounts of inflammatory mediators. At the same time, activated
  astrocytes produce CCL, CXCL, IL-6, GM-CSF, and other cytokines, which are involved
  in regulating microglial migration, activation, and proliferation. ④ ROS, NO, and
  various cytokines released from M1 microglia are toxic to neighboring neurons, leading
  to neuronal dysfunction
