figure_title: Correlation between conjugated bilirubin and presepsin in sepsis.
caption: 'Correlation between conjugated bilirubin and presepsin in sepsis. Sepsis
  induces cholestasis by reducing the activity of membrane pumps, including MRP2,
  which is involved in transporting bilirubin from hepatocytes into the bile ducts.
  In sepsis, the PI3K signaling pathway is activated, leading to MRP2 reduction. The
  downregulation of the Farnesoid X receptor further contributes to NLRP3 inflammasome
  assembly, IL-1β synthesis, and subsequent MRP2 decrease. Increased MRP3 activity
  serves as a protective mechanism, facilitating the transport of excess bilirubin
  from hepatocytes into the bloodstream. LPS stimulates hepatocytes and Kupffer cells
  to produce IL-6, which reduces MRP2 levels. In sepsis, various cells (including
  monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, along with Kupffer cells, hepatocytes,
  and biliary epithelial cells) stimulated by LPS increase presepsin production. However,
  kidney and liver biliary dysfunction induced by sepsis decreases presepsin clearance,
  resulting in elevated presepsin levels. ↓: decrease/downregulate, ↑: increase/upregulate
