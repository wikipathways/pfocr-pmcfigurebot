figure_title: Summary of an intracellular Mg2+-mediated pathway regulating synaptic
  configuration
caption: 'a Schematic to show that the synaptic configuration is a biomarker for dendritic
  branch-specific synaptic computations. Intracellular Mg2+ regulates the configuration
  and optimizes computational properties of nearby synapses along individual branches,
  including transmission efficiency, plasticity, and coding capacity (see Discussion).
  b A [Mg2+]i-mediated regulatory pathway (left, schematic pathway; top-right, regulatory
  scheme in a bouton). In brief, [Mg2+]i exerts a dual effect on D and Pr. On the
  one hand, [Mg2+]i enhances mitochondrion (Mito) functions by increasing Mito number
  and membrane potential (ΔΨ). This leads to an increase in intracellular free ATP
  levels ([ATP]i), promoting the anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT) of CaSPs.
  As a result, presynaptic [CaSPs] increases, converting a remarkable portion of synapses
  from silent to functional and increasing D. On the other hand, it has an ongoing
  negative effect on Pr likely by competing with intracellular Ca2+ on presynaptic
  Ca2+-binding proteins (CBPs) (top-right). Overall, the changes in [Mg2+]i lead to
  varying synaptic configurations across individual dendritic branches. Notably, at
  presynaptic sites, the strength of vesicle release during bursting transmission
  is dominantly determined by both burst-induced facilitation of presynaptic Ca2+
  influx and [CaSPs], suggesting a regulatory scheme: ↑[Mg2+]i → ↑ [CaSPs] → ↑ Prburst.
  In synergy, the increase in [ATP]i accompanied by elevated [Mg2+]i can well support
  the high-energy demand of vesicle turnover during bursting transmission. Consequently,
  ↑[Mg2+]i causes increases in both ΣPrburst and short-term facilitation (STF, =ΣPrburst/ΣPr)
  at dendritic branches. At postsynaptic sites, elevated [Mg2+]i induces an increase
  in [GluN2B], enhancing Ca2+ influx via GluN2B*NMDARs in dendritic spines ([Ca2+]burstspine)
  during bursting transmission. Hence, both pre- and postsynaptic sites synergize
  burst-induced synaptic plasticity,. Overall, the synaptic configuration, crucially
  regulated by [Mg2+]i, determines branch-specific synaptic computations during information
  processing.'
