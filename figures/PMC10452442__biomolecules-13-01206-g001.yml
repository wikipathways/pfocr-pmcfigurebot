figure_title: Strigolactone biosynthetic pathway in rice.
caption: Strigolactone biosynthetic pathway in rice. SL biosynthesis involves sequential
  actions of an isomerase, DWARF27 (D27); two CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASES 7 (CCD7)
  and CCD8; cytochrome P450 (CYPs) from the 711 clade and other enzymes. D27 catalyzes
  the reversible isomerization of all-trans- into 9-cis-Î²-carotene. The latter one
  is further converted by CCD7 and CCD8 into carlactone (CL), a key intermediate in
  SL biosynthesis. Canonical and non-canonical SLs arise through the conversion of
  CL by different CYPs and further modifications by other enzymes, such as a methyltransferase
