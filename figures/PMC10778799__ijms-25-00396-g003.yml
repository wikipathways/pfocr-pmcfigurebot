figure_title: Different types of mycolic acids activate host cellular immunity and
  cholesterol accumulation.
caption: Different types of mycolic acids activate host cellular immunity and cholesterol
  accumulation. (A) TDM binding to Mincle triggers activation and upregulation of
  the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophage, leading to release of caspase-1, which can
  promote the maturation of IL-1β (red arrow). In addition, TDM also promote the activation
  of Mincle–Syk-CARD9/Bcl10/MALT1 complex to mediate NF-κB signaling pathway to produce
  IL-1β (green arrow). MCL binds to Mincle to help recognize TDM. The synthetic analogue
  of TDM is TDB, which is an agonist for Mincle. TDB activates MYD88 pathway and enhances
  cytokine secretion through recognizing Mincle and TLR4 receptors. In addition, MYD88
  pathway phosphorylates PtdIns3K, STAT1 to promote autophagy. This mechanism played
  a key role in controlling the growth of Mtb (orange arrow). Non-glycosylated mycolic
  acids play roles in host immunity. Free MAs are recognized by TREM2 receptor, which
  induces STING-dependent upregulation of TREM2 expression, which, in turn, enhances
  IFN-β and IL-10 secretion. The secretion of IFN-β inhibits proinflammatory cytokine
  production, which results in the increased intracellular survival of Mtb. Meanwhile,
  the expression of TREM2 inhibits the activation of Mincle to aggravate Mtb infection
  (gray arrow). (B) Mincle triggers phosphorylation of the MEK1/2 in neutrophils,
  resulting in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 protein into the nucleus to promote the
  secretion of cytokines and the expression of CD11b and CD 18 molecules (purple arrow).
  (B) Once inside the host, Mtb is retained within the phagosomes, and secretes its
  cell wall components. Thereafter, the secreted components, mainly lipids and mycolic
  acid, are trafficked from the phagosome into the cytosol. Various host factors are
  present as sensors and effectors in the cellular milieu. The nuclear receptor TR4
  binds to the secreted mycolic acid (keto-MA). Activation of the receptor by ligand
  binding leads to downstream regulation of gene involved in lipid biogenesis through
  its binding to its target gene having the TR4 response element (blue arrow)
