caption: Effects of p,pʹ-bis-[4-chlorophenyl]-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) on apoptotic
  pathway signaling in human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). (A, B) ESCs were treated
  with p,pʹ-DDT at concentrations of 0, 1,000, and 1,000 pg/mL+fulvestrant (ICI) for
  72 hours. Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we
  assessed the messenger RNA expression levels of genes involved in the intrinsic
  and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, including B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL),
  B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), caspase-3, caspase-6,
  and caspase-8, in the ESCs. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served
  as an internal control for the experiments. The reported values are the means derived
  from three separate experiments, with the data normalized accordingly. (C) Morphological
  evidence of apoptosis induced by p,pʹ-DDT. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained
  micrographs depict control (left) and DDT-exposed (right) ESCs. These images were
  obtained using cytometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy. (D) Immunoblots
  for (a) Bax and Bcl-2 and (b) FAS, caspase-3, and caspase-9. The cells were exposed
  to various concentrations of p,pʹ-DDT for 72 hours, followed by analysis through
  Western blotting. Protein levels were normalized to β-actin (the loading control)
  and are presented as relative fold changes in comparison to control values. Data
  are expressed as the mean±standard error of the mean. a)p-values that denote statistical
  significance when compared to the control cells at the corresponding time point,
  as determined by the Student t-test (p<0.05); b)p<0.005 c)p-values that denote statistical
  significance when compared to the control cells at the corresponding time point,
  as determined by analysis of variance (p<0.05)
