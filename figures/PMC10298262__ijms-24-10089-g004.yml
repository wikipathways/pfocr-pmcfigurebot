caption: Gene expression pattern and activity analysis of nitrogen metabolism in S.
  rugosoannulata. (A) Gene expression profiles of the nitrogen metabolic pathway under
  three nitrogen levels. The enzyme activities of NR (B), NiR (C), GOGAT (D), GDH
  (E), AS (F) and GS (G) under three nitrogen levels. All data are presented as the
  means ± SDs of three independent experiments. Bars with different letters are significantly
  different at p < 0.05 according to Duncan’s multiple range test
