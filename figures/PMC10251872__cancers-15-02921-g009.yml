figure_title: Differential expression of previously reported down-regulated chemokine-related
  genes (upper panel, left side) and up-regulated chemokine-related genes (upper panel,
  right side), down-regulation of SLC4A4 (middle panel, left side) and up-regulation
  of TIMP1 (middle panel, right side).
caption: Differential expression of previously reported down-regulated chemokine-related
  genes (upper panel, left side) and up-regulated chemokine-related genes (upper panel,
  right side), down-regulation of SLC4A4 (middle panel, left side) and up-regulation
  of TIMP1 (middle panel, right side). Up-regulation of expression of IL-17 signaling
  pathway (lower panel, left side) and down-regulation of Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation
  gene (lower panel, right side). Sporadic CRC tissue is shown in blue and adjacent
  normal tissue is shown in red
