caption: 'Energy metabolism in the normal heart and failing heart. (a). In the normal
  heart, FAs are the main substrate for cardiac ATP production, whereas carbohydrates
  (glucose and lactate), ketone bodies, and BCAAs play a lesser role. (b). In the
  condition of HF, myocardial substrate utilisation shifts from FAs towards carbohydrates
  (especially glycolysis). The uncoupling between glycolysis and glucose oxidation,
  and the diminished cardiac BCAA catabolism, lead to the accumulation of glycolytic
  intermediates and BCAAs (leucine), activating the mTOR signalling pathway, which
  contributes to insulin resistance and pathological remodelling. In addition, the
  myocardium increasingly relies on ketone bodies as an alternative fuel. Nutrient
  deprivation sensors, including SIRT1 and AMPK, are suppressed in the condition of
  HF, leading to reduced FAO, impaired mitochondria biogenesis and dynamics, and increased
  oxidative stress through the effects on downstream transcriptional regulators (mainly
  PCG-1α). Abbreviations: FFA:free fatty acid; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; ADP: adenosine
