caption: Hypothetical mechanisms of the antifibrotic action of rosmarinic acid (RA).
  RA can remove ROS and suppress cell activation, EMT, and fibrogenic gene expression
  by inhibiting the stress-induced expression of TGF-β, CTGF, and Wnt and their signaling
  pathways. Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ is repressed in myofibroblastic
  cells, and RA restores the gene expression of PPAR γ through an epigenetic mechanism
  that reduces the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). PPARγ activates 5′
  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits cell activation, EMT, and fibrogenic
  gene expression. RA also activates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  (NRF) 2 via multiple mechanisms to induce the transcriptional expression of phase
  II/antioxidant enzymes, and the increased expression of catalytic subunits of glutamate
  cysteine ligase (GCLc) promotes the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), thereby reducing
  ROS. Collectively, RA alleviates oxidative stress and maintains the structural and
  functional integrity of the organs through multiple mechanisms. Profibrotic and
  antifibrotic factors are shown in brown and green circles, respectively. Sharp red
  arrows (→) indicate stimulation, and blunt blue arrows (⊥) indicate suppression
