  diet-induced NASH mouse model.
caption: 'miR-552-3p down-regulates fibrotic and inflammatory responses in HFHFrHC
  diet-induced NASH mouse model. (A) Schematic diagram of HFHFrHC-induced animal experiment.
  (B) Relative level of miR-552-3p in the liver tissues. (C) HE staining of liver
  samples. Scale bar: 100 µm. (D) Liver coefficient presented by liver weight to body
  weight ratio. (E-F) Serum ALT and AST levels. (G) Sirius red, Masson''s trichrome
  and α-SMA staining of liver samples. Scale bar: 100 µm. (H-J) Fibrotic area per
  field was quantified. (K) Content of hydroxyproline in mouse livers. (L-M) Relative
  mRNA levels of fibrotic and inflammatory genes in mouse livers. (N-O) Protein levels
  of Collagen Ⅰ, p-Smad3 and t-Smad3 in TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. (P) Relative
  mRNA levels of Tgfbr2, Smad3 in mouse livers. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
