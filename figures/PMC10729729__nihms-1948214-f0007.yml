figure_title: FABP5-VCP interaction promotes the TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling pathway
caption: (A) The workflow on immunoprecipitation with anti-FABP5 antibody in HaCaT
  cells.(B and C) Silver staining (B) and Coomassie blue staining (C) on SDS-PAGE
  gel for immunoprecipitated complexes. Blue arrow shows the band for FABP5, and orange
  arrow shows the band for VCP.(D and E) Validation of FABP5-VCP interaction using
  immunoprecipitation and western blot. HaCaT lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP)
  with anti-FABP5 antibody (D) and anti-VCP antibody (E), separately. Immunoblots
  were performed with anti-VCP antibody and anti-FABP5 antibody as indicated in the
  figure.(F and G) Images of HaCaT cells show co-localization of FABP5 and VCP using
  confocal analysis (F). The straight line indicates the region of interest (ROI)
  utilized to measure the fluorescence intensity in both VCP and FABP5 (G). FABP5
  (green), VCP (red), Hochest33342 (blue). Scale bars, 50 μm.(H) Detection of NF-κB
  signaling activation using western blot. Transient silencing FABP5 with RNAi for
  24 h in HaCaT cells and controls were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α for the indicated
  time points. FABP5, VCP, p-IκBα(S32), and p-NFκB(S536) were detected. β-Actin was
  used as internal control.(I–K) The levels of p-IκBα(S32), p-NFκB p65 (S536), and
  FABP5 were quantified using ImageJ from three independent western blots experiments
  (*p < 0.05). Data are shown as mean ± SD in (I–K) (*p ≤ 0.05 compared with the siNC
  control group, unpaired Student’s t test). See also Figure S7
