caption: Identification of EGFR signaling pathway genes in hMSCs treated with TUDCA.
  hMSCs were treated with TUDCA at concentrations of 250 and 500 μM, total RNA and
  protein were extracted from the cells, and then qRT-PCR and Western blotting were
  performed. (A–D) The mRNA levels of EGFR, CREB1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 were determined
  and normalized to GAPDH mRNA. (E) Protein levels of p-Akt, Akt, and GAPDH were determined.
  All data represent the mean ± S.D. of five independent experiments. * p < 0.05,
  ** p < 0.001 versus the control group
