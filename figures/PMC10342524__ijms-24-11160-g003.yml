caption: The NF-κB signaling pathway and pyroptosis in rat bladder tissues after SCI.
  (A) Immunohistochemical staining of bladder tissue showed increased expression of
  P-P65 in the NB group (scale bar = 100 μm). (B) The ratio of the NF-κB pathway protein
  P-P65/P65 and IKBα expression levels in tissues were detected by Western blotting.
  (C) Serum levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18 in rats (n = 5 each group). (D–F) Immunofluorescence
  staining and mean fluorescence intensity analysis of NLRP3 and ASC in bladder tissues
  (scale bar = 100 μm). (G) SEM showed disorganized cell arrangement in the epithelial
  layer of the rat bladder after SCI, increased filamentous secretions, and the generation
  of pyroptotic bodies. Scale bar = 10 μm, arrows indicate pyroptotic bodies. (H)
  TEM showed cell death, abnormal endoplasmic reticulum morphology and structural
  disruption. Scale bar = 2 μm, arrows indicate abnormal endoplasmic reticulum. (I)
  Protein expression levels of NLRP3, GSDMD, ASC, and IL1-β in the two groups were
  detected by Western blotting. The data are presented as the mean ± SD; ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, ns, not significant
