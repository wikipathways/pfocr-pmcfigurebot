caption: Correlation between DKK1 and genes associated with immune checkpoints in
  oral squamous cell carcinoma. DKK1 expression was positively correlated with the
  expression levels of (A) CD40, (B) CD44, (C) VTCN1, (D) NRP1, (E) PDCD1LG2, (F)
  CD276, (G) CD80 and (H) CD86 and negatively correlated with expression levels of
  (I) TNFRSR18, (J) CD27, (K) TIGIT, (L) IDO2, (M) CD48, (N) CD244 and (O) CD40LG.
  DKK1, Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor 1; VTCN1, v-set domain containing
  T cell activation inhibitor 1; NRP1, neuropilin 1; PDCD1LG2, programmed cell death
  1 ligand 2; TNFRSR18, TNF receptor superfamily member 18; TIGIT, T cell immunoreceptor
  with Ig and ITIM domains; IDO2, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2; CD40LG, CD40 ligand;
  TPM, transcripts per million
