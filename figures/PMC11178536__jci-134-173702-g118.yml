figure_title: Day 24 SMA iHeps show dysregulation of genes implicated in mitochondrial
  function and lipid metabolism
caption: (A) RT-qPCR of mitochondrial OXPHOS-related genes. (B) RT-qPCR of lipid transport
  genes. For ALB, APOE, and APOA1, one outlier from SMA3 was removed using the ROUT
  test with a maximum FDR of 1%. (C) RT-qPCR of lipid and cholesterol synthesis pathway
  genes. (D) RT-qPCR of β-oxidation pathway genes. Data are from 3 to 4 independent
  experiments, each with 3 biological replicates. In A–D, unless specifically indicated
  that outliers were removed, analysis of data from 3 independent experiments included
  9 samples (n = 9) each for WT, SMA3, and SMA1 conditions. Similarly for analysis
  of data from 4 independent experiments, n = 12 for each condition. Data were analyzed
  using 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test and are presented as mean
  ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001
