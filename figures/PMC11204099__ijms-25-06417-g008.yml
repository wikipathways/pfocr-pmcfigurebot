caption: Effects of chlorogenic acid and cinnamaldehyde synergism on Akt-mediated
  signaling pathway downstream target proteins. Addition of CGA–CA inhibits phosphorylation
  of Akt (1) and inhibits expression of Bcl-2α (2), allowing induction of apoptosis
  via caspase 3 upregulation (3). Concurrently, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation
  affects N-cadherin and MMP9 expression (presumably by inhibiting SNAIL), causing
  upregulation of E-cadherin (4), and ultimately decreasing invasion and migration
  in breast cancer cells
