caption: 'Enriched metabolic pathways of DEGs by KEGG. (A) KEGG classification on
  DEGs; note: y-axis: KEGG pathway terms; x-axis: Number and the percentage of genes
  annotated to the KEGG pathway. (B) TOP 20 pathways of KEGG enrichment; note: the
  q-value to determine the enrichment significance was calculated through hypergeometric
  distribution. (C) Starch and sucrose metabolic pathway in 31-bp Del. note: red indicates
  up-regulated genes, green indicates down-regulated genes'
