figure_title: Lumbrokinase induced cellular apoptosis and inhibited proliferation
  and metastasis in chemo-resistant NSCLC cells.
caption: Lumbrokinase induced cellular apoptosis and inhibited proliferation and metastasis
  in chemo-resistant NSCLC cells. (A) H-T (H460 cells with paclitaxel resistance)
  and H-V (H460 cells with vincristine resistance) cells were treated with different
  concentrations of EFE for 48 h, and the cell viability was tested by MTT assay.
  (B) The colony formation assay was performed in H-T and H-V cells treated with different
  concentrations of EFE. (C) H-T and H-V cells were treated with EFE for 48 h, and
  the expression levels of MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by
  Western blot. (D) The expression levels of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related proteins
  in H-T and H-V cells after EFE treatment for 48 h were detected by Western blot.
  (E) The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins in H-T and H-V cells treated with
  EFE for 48 h were detected by Western blot. (F) FC analysis was used to detect cell
  apoptosis in H-V and H-T cells treated with EFE for 48 h. The percentage of apoptotic
  cells was further calculated. (G) Wound-healing assay of H-T and H-V cells treated
  with EFE was performed to detect the capacity of cell migration (magnification 40×).
  The cell migration rate was calculated through the quantification of migration distance.
  (H) The invasive capacity of H-T and H-V cells treated with two doses of lumbrokinase
  for 48 h was analyzed by transwell assay. The invaded cells were stained with crystal
  violet and the representative images were taken with an inverted microscope (magnification
  40×). (I) The expressions of EMT-related proteins in H-T and H-V cells treated with
  EFE were detected by Western blot. The level of significance was indicated by *
  p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
