figure_title: Palovarotene treatment stimulates the Stat3 pathway.
caption: Palovarotene treatment stimulates the Stat3 pathway. (A) Immunoblot results
  of chondrocyte cultures. Primary epiphyseal chondrocytes were isolated from P3-P7
  wild-type C57BL/6J mice and seeded at a density of 3.0 × 104 cells/cm2 in high glucose
  Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. On Day 2,
  the cultures were treated with 300 nM palovarotene, 100 nM NRX204647, or 150 ng/mL
  mouse interferon beta (mIFNb) for 2 or 24 h. The cultures were subjected to immunoblot
  analysis with antibodies to phospho-Stat1, phospho-Stat2, or phospho-Stat3, followed
  by reblotting with an anti-α- tubulin antibody. (B) Cignal Finder® reporter assay
  data. Primary epiphyseal chondrocytes isolated from RARγ null mice were subjected
  to reverse transfection with the reporter constructs on the Cignal Finder 45-Pathway
  Reporter Array plate at a density of 3.0 × 104 cells/cm2. The next day, the culture
  was treated with 100 nM NRX204647 for 24 h. (C) Immunohistochemical staining for
  phospho-Stat3. AcanCreER;Ext1f/f mice received palovarotene (Palovarotene, 1.76
  mg/kg) or corn oil (Control) gavage daily for 3 days starting at 3.5 weeks of age
  after tamoxifen injections at P5 and P7. The forelimbs were then harvested. Coronal
  sections of the forelimbs were immuno-stained with the phospho-Stat3 antibody, followed
  by Fast Green counterstaining
