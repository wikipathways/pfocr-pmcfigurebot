caption: TNBC cell-derived VEGFA promotes TAM polarization into M2 type and schematic
  of the crosstalk between TAMs and TNBC cells. (A-B) Flow cytometry analysis of the
  expressions of M2 macrophage markers (CD163 and CD206) after co-cultured with conditional
  medium from control TNBC cells or VEGFA-silencing TNBC cells. (C) RT-qPCR analysis
  of M1-related markers (CD80 and CD86) and M2-related markers (CD163, CD206 and IL-10)
  expression after co-cultured with conditional medium from control TNBC cells or
  VEGFA-silencing TNBC cells. The images show representative data, and data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD of each group of cells from three separate experiments. *P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001 vs. the controls. (D) Schematic of the crosstalk between
  TAMs and TNBC cells mediated by VEGFA in the promotion of breast cancer stemness.
  VEGFA (secreted by TAMs in a paracrine manner and by TNBC cells in an autocrine
  manner) binds to NRP-1 and activates the downstream GAPVD1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway to promote the stemness of TNBC. Additionally, VEGFA may provide an immunosuppressive
  microenvironment for tumor progression by recruiting TAMs and facilitating the M2
  polarization of TAMs
