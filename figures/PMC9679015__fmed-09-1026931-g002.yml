caption: 'The role of POLDIP2 in the modulation of disease-related signaling pathways.
  (A) Domain map of POLDIP2. POLDIP2 contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting
  peptide (mTP) and two main functional domains: a DUF525 domain and a hemimethylated
  YccV-like domain. DUF525 may be involved in protein-protein interaction and cation
  efflux, respectively. YccV may bind to DNA and regulate its expression. (B) POLDIP2
  can increase the focal adhesion turnover and cell polarization of VSMCs. POLDIP2
  participates in the migration of VSMCs by promoting the NOX4/RhoA/FAK pathway. POLDIP2
  is involved in the cytokinesis and proliferation of VSMCs by activating RhoGEF epithelial
  cell transformation sequence 2 (ECT2) and its downstream molecule RhoA. (C) POLDIP2
  is a novel regulator of Tau aggregation in Alzheimer’s disease and another tauopathy.
  Expression of POLDIP2 can be increased in neuronal cells by the multiple stresses,
  including Aβ, TNF-α, and H2O2. POLDIP2 overexpression can induce impairments of
  autophagy activity and partially proteasome activity and subsequently result in
  Tau aggregation. (D) In the TGF-β-induced rat renal myofibroblast differentiation
  model, the activation of the RhoA/Rock/POLDIP2/NOX4/ROS pathway can induce the activation
  of renal myofibroblasts, which may be of great significance in the pathogenesis
  of renal fibrosis. (E) Lin et al. have studied the effect of NOX4/p22phox/POLDIP2
  interactions on the activity of TRPV1-mediated mechanosensation. Using co-immunoprecipitation
  experiments, they have demonstrated that POLDIP2 can interact with NOX4 and p22phox
  in renal pelvis lysates. The elevation of intrapelvic pressure (IPP) stimulates
  POLDIP2 expression and enhances the association between POLDIP2 and p22phox, which
  further activates NOX4. NOX4 stimulates TRPV1 by producing H2O2, increases the release
  of substrate P (SP), and boosts afferent renal nerve activity (ARNA). The mechanism
  clarifies the cause of renal non-response to fluid retention and provides a new
  therapeutic strategy for relieving abnormal fluid retention. (F) POLDIP2, a mitochondrial
  protein, can increase mitochondrial lipoacylation, enhance cell respiration, and
  reduce the growth rate of cancer cells. POLDIP2 binding to CLPX can restrain lipoic
  acid-activating enzyme Ac-CoA synthetase medium-chain family member 1 (ACSM1) degradation.
  Consequently, lipoyl-AMP is produced, and lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) has a substrate
  for the lipoylation of dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT) and dihydrolipoamide
  S-succinyltransferase (DLST). The lipoylation promotes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, leading to prolyl hydroxylase-2 (PHD2) production and HIF-1α degradation.
  However, POLDIP2 expression is declined in breast cancer cells. (G) POLDIP2 is downregulated
  in NSCLC tissues, and the overexpressed POLDIP2 increases the anchorage independent
  growth (AIG) and proliferation of NSCLC cells. As shown in the mechanism study,
  POLDIP2 knockdown can significantly impair the expression of cell proliferation,
  cyclin D1, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, cdh2, and slug and twist,
  thereby indicating that POLDIP2 participates in regulating tumor growth and invasiveness.'
