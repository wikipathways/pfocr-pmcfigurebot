figure_title: Aβ42 activates the Dectin-1-Syk signaling pathway by binding to Dectin-1
  and inducing its homodimerization.
caption: Aβ42 activates the Dectin-1-Syk signaling pathway by binding to Dectin-1
  and inducing its homodimerization. (A) BV2 cells are treated with 20 µM Bio- Aβ42
  or free biotin for 45 min, and cells are double-stained for biotin (green) and Dectin-1
  (red) or Trem 2 (red), respectively. Nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (blue)
  [scale bar = 5 μm]. (B) Bio-Aβ42 is added to streptavidin-agarose beads and incubated.
  Biotin alone was used as control. Lysates prepared from BV2 cells were added to
  beads. The eluent was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel for western blot analysis.
  Total lysates were used as input controls. Trem2 was used as a positive control.
  (C) The Dectin-1-APP/ β-amyloid interaction is analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation
  in the brains of WT and model mice. (D) Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis
  showing a direct interaction between Aβ42 and rhDectin-1. Mean KD constant derived
  from five separate experiments. (E) 3D binding model of dectin-1 and amyloid beta
  peptide. The backbones of dectin-1 and amyloid beta peptide are shown as cartoons.
  The residues in dectin-1 are shown as cyan sticks, whereas the residues in amyloid
  beta-peptide are shown as wheat sticks. The hydrogen bonds are depicted as red dashed
  lines and the salt bridges are depicted as blue dashed lines
