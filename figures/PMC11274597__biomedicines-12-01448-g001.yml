caption: Outline of the HH signaling pathway [16]. If an Hh ligand is present, SMO
  is phosphorylated, and SUFU is re-activated, while GLI2 induces Hh target genes
  of transcription. However, if an Hh ligand is absent, GLI is phosphorylated by PKA,
  GSK3, and CK1, forming GLI3R (GLI repressor), thus inhibiting the Hh target genes
