caption: '(a) STRING pathway analysis on patient with PSEN2 Thr421Met mutation: PSEN2
  may interact directly with different AD (such as EPHA1, ABCA7, and SORL1) and non-AD
  (NOTCH3, MAPT, and LRRK2) risk genes. (b) Pathway analysis by ClueGo confirmed that
  PSEN2 may interact with SORL1 and ABCA7 genes, involved in cargo receptor activity.
  Further indirect associations also appeared between PSEN2 and LRRK2, GAK, SETX,
  or SLC24A4, which may impact lysosomal transport.'
