  (A) The volcano plot of the differentially expressed genes in MCF10A cells treated
  with 231EXO compared with untreated MCF10A cells. The blue dots show the significantly
  (fold change < 0.5, p-value < 0.001) down-regulated genes and the red dots show
  the significantly (fold change > 2, p-value < 0.001) up-regulated genes. (B) KEGG
  analysis of the differentially upregulated genes between untreated MCF10A cells
  and MCF10A cells treated with 231EXO for 2 weeks. The input gene number, p-value
  and rich factor of each signaling pathway are indicated. (C) The verification of
  the inflammation-related-mRNA levels of TNF, NOD2, CXCL1 and CSF1 by qPCR in MCF10A
  cells treated with 231EXO on day 0, 3, 9 and 16. (D) The Venn diagram shows the
  differentially expressed gene number in MCF10A WT/ KO cells treated with/ without
  231EXO. (E) KEGG analysis of genes that were significantly upregulated in MCF10A
  CREPT-WT cells but not significantly up-regulated in MCF10A CREPT-KO cells. The
  input gene number, p-value and rich factor of each signaling pathway are indicated.
  (F) Heatmap of the mRNA levels of genes related to TNF signaling pathway in MCF10A
  CREPT-WT and CREPT-KO cells treated with PBS or 231EXO. The mRNA levels of TNFRSF1B
  (G) and PIK3CD (H) were quantified by qPCR of MCF10A WT/ KO cells treated with/
  without 231EXO. (I) Western blot of CREPT, p-AKT, AKT, p-p65 and p65 in protein
  extracts of MCF10A CREPT-WT and CREPT-KO cells treated with 231EXO for 0, 1, 3,
  6 and 9 days. The statistics analysis of p-AKT and p-p65 levels was present (J-K),
