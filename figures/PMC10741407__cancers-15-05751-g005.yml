caption: 'KMT inhibitors. (a) UNC0642: an example of methylation inhibition by competitive
  blocking of the G9a binding pocket, (b) G9a and GLP-affected pathways: H3K9 di-methylation
  inhibits caspase 1 expression; G9a demethylates p53, inhibits its activity, and
  enhances the expression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which is implicated in cell
  proliferation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Red arrows—up arrow is
  an indicative of upregulation, down arrow is an indicative of downregulation, and
  blunt arrow is an indicative of impairment'
