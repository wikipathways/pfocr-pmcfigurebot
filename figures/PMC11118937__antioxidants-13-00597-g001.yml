figure_title: The role of Nrf2 signaling in mitigating heat stress and xenobiotic-induced
  oxidative distress and apoptosis.
caption: 'The role of Nrf2 signaling in mitigating heat stress and xenobiotic-induced
  oxidative distress and apoptosis. (A) Exogenous supplementation of bioactive compounds
  with antioxidant ability activates the Nrf2/KEAP1 signaling pathway. This activation
  leads to NRF2 translocation to the nucleus and heterodimerization with sMaf proteins.
  Subsequently, there is binding with ARE to activate antioxidant genes (SOD, CAT,
  NQO1, HO1, and GPx). The activation of these antioxidant genes enhances the antioxidant
  response by suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis induced via heat stress and
  xenobiotics. (B) Oxidative stress induced by xenobiotics/heat stress increases the
  level of KEAP1 and inhibits the translocation of NRF2 to the nucleus, leading to
  oxidative damage and apoptosis of reproductive cells. Note: Blunt arrows () indicate
  inhibition and sharp arrows (â†’) indicate stimulation'
