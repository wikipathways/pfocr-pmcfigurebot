caption: 'A comparison of genomic selection between the BFC and other Felis species.
  (A) Plots of principal components 1, 2, and 3 from PCA analysis of Felis spp. (B)
  Distribution of ln (pi ratios) and Fst values calculated in 50-kb sliding windows
  with 25-kb increments between BFCs group and control group (including jungle cat,
  sand cat, and other five wildcat species). The data points in blue [corresponding
  to the top 5% of the empirical ln(pi ratios) distribution with values < = -3.485
  and the top 5% of the empirical Fst distribution with values > 0.406] are genomic
  regions under selection in BFC group. (C) The top 20 KEGG pathways were identified
  by the functional enrichment tests on genes that are under selection from Tajima’s
  D test, and the most significant item is the metabolic pathway (P: 4.76E-05). The
  KEGG items with different colors were associated with metabolism (red), immune (blue),
  and nervous system (orange). (D) A region with significant genetic divergence and
  selection (Fst = 4.793 and π ratio = 2.652) between BFC and other contains three
  genes: MRPL30, MITD1 and LIPT1, and the pattern of genotypes shows the different
  between BFC (major allele) in yellow and others (minor allele) in blue.'
