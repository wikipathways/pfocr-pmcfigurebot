caption: (A–D) Representative immunoblots (A) and quantification of PJA1 (B), p-CREB
  (C), and CREB (D) in normal human astrocytes (NHAs). n = 6 samples per group. (E–H)
  Representative immunoblots (E) and quantification of PJA1 (F), p-CREB (G), and CREB
  (H) after H89 treatment. n = 6 samples per group. (I) The binding of CREB to the
  promoter region of Pja1 in NHAs was assessed by ChIP. The experiment was repeated
  3 times. (J) Co-IP showing the interaction between PJA1 and AACT (a homolog of Serpina3n
  in humans). (K) The level of AACT in the plasma was measured by ELISA. n = 9 samples
  in the premenopausal group. n = 8 samples in the postmenopausal group. Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA with
  Tukey’s posthoc test (B–D and F–H) or independent sample t test (I–K)
