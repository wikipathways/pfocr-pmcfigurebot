figure_title: Mechanism of action of heparin relevant to pharmacogene identification
  (further details provided in the Data Supplement).
caption: 'Mechanism of action of heparin relevant to pharmacogene identification (further
  details provided in the Data Supplement). The coagulation cascade intrinsic (black)
  and extrinsic (blue) pathways are indicated. Genes encoding participating proteins
  are highlighted in yellow. ① The conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is reduced by
  ② heparin, which inhibits Factors Xa and IIa. Low molecular weight heparin and unfractionated
  heparin bind to antithrombin III (AT-III encoded by SERPINC1 and ③ produced in the
  liver) and ④ enhance inhibition of FXa and FXa plus FIIa, respectively. LMWH: low
  molecular weight heparin; UFH: unfractionated heparin'
