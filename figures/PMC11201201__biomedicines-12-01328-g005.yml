figure_title: Marketed drugs targeting the VEGF/VEGFR axis and its downstream signaling
  pathway.
caption: 'Marketed drugs targeting the VEGF/VEGFR axis and its downstream signaling
  pathway. Figure presents drugs marketed around the world with principal mode of
  action grouping them into ones that act on interaction of VEGF and VEGF-R, those
  that inhibit tyrosine kinase and those that interact or block downstream signaling
  through one of the three major pathways. Reproduced with permission from Wang, L.,
