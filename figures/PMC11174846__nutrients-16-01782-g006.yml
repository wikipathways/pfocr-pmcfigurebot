caption: 'GPE suppresses the expression of inflammatory genes in the liver. (A) Pathway
  analysis of liver tissue of NASH mice based on transcriptomics in combination with
  ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) between the MCD and LGPE groups; (B) pathway analysis
  of liver tissue of NASH mice based on transcriptomics in combination with ingenuity
  pathway analysis (IPA) between the MCD and HGPE groups; (C) the level of IL-1β in
  blood serum was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (n = 4); (D)
  the level of LBP in blood serum was tested by ELISA (n = 4); (E–J) RT-PCR of IL-1β,
  Ccr5, TLR4, CD14, Myd88, and TNF-α mRNA expression in liver. The relative expression
  of IL-1β, Ccr5, TNF-α, Myd88, CD14, and TLR4 was adjusted with GAPDH as the housekeeping
  gene (n = 5). Each biological replicate (n = 4–5) had three technical replicate
  wells for the experiment. Data are expressed as means ± SEM. # p < 0.05, ## p <
  0.01 vs. the MCS group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. the MCD group'
