  (MI).
caption: 'ACN aids in cell recovery in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI).
  (A) HE staining of myocardial tissues in each group. (Bâ€“E) Measurement of Nt-proBNP,
  NO, Hs-CRP, and Angiotensin II levels in myocardial cells of each experimental group
  using ELISA. (F,G) Effects of ACN on myocardial infarct area in MI model mice. (H)
  Expression levels of PTEN-Akt pathway-related proteins in MI model mice of each
  group. *: p < 0.1, ** (##): p < 0.01, *** (###): p < 0.001. p-values for differences
  between cohorts in mean scores in tests are based on analysis of variance (one-way
  ANOVA)'
