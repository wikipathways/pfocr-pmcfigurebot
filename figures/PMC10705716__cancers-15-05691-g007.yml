caption: 'TMEM97 knockdown reduces both ERα and mTOR/S6K1 signaling activity and increases
  the tamoxifen sensitivity: two mechanisms for TMEM97 to regulate ERα activities.
  (A). Dual luciferase assay for MCF7-GIPZ, 131, 836, and 602 cells. Cells were transiently
  transfected with ERE reporter construct under full serum culture conditions for
  24 h. After being serum and estrogen depleted for another 24 h, cells were subjected
  to 10 µM E2 treatment for 5 h and harvested for dual luciferase assay. Results show
  relative luciferase activities. (B). Immunoblot detection of p-ERα S167 with or
  without 10 µM E2 treatment for 5 h under serum- and estrogen-depleted conditions.
  (C). Immunoblot for phosphorylation of mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway with or without
  10 µM E2 treatment for 5 h under serum- and estrogen-depleted conditions. (D). Responsiveness
  to tamoxifen treatment of MCF7-TMEM97 knockdown cells. Cells were serum and estrogen
  deprived for 24 h prior to 4 days of culture in E2 10µM and increasing concentrations
  of OH-Tam, as indicated. The proliferative capacity was measured by MTS assay and
  relative to E2 stimulation alone, respectively. The results represent the mean ±
  S.D. of each experiment performed in quadruplicate. *, p < 0.05. **, p < 0.01 by
  two-tailed paired Student’s t test. (E). Regulation of ERα by TMEM97. TMEM97 can
  regulate the activities of ERα through modulating ERα binding to estradiol and binding
  to responsive elements in the promoters of ER target genes. Another mechanism involved
  is the TMEM97 modulation of mTOR/S6K1 signaling in the activation of ERα. The original
