figure_title: The GATA factors regulate parietal TGC-specific paracrine factors and
  help maintain hematopoietic-angiogenic balance
caption: (A) PyMINEr based prediction of the enriched paracrine ligands expressed
  by cells in cluster 33 shows receptor matched targets in four major clusters that
  include HSPC/ HSC containing cluster 33, hematoendothelial cluster 15, trophoblast
  progenitor cluster 6 and labyrinthine trophoblast cluster 16. Major signaling pathways
  involved Integrin signaling pathway members lamin and collagen group 4 of proteins
  and prolactin family of hormones. (B) Prl3d1 expressing cells in cluster 33 were
  further analyzed for the level of paracrine factors expression. While almost all
  the Integrin pathway members were upregulated, all the prolactin family members
  showed downregulation in the GATA Pl1-KO samples compared to the control. Average
  log2 fold change expression values are plotted. (C) Immunostaining of E13.5 placental
  sections with LAMBI and LAMB2 antibodies show increased expression for both the
  proteins in the pTGCs of the KO samples than controls (Scale Bar 100Î¼m)
