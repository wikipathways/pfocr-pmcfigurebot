caption: 'Cell-to-cell crosstalk in EnD and EnC of adenomyosis. (A) The number of
  connections between different cell types in EnC of adenomyosis by CellphoneDB: vascular
  progenitor cells (Vas Prog), ciliated epithelial cells (Cili Epi), MKI67+ cells
  (MKI67+), NK cells (NK), mast cells (Mast), T cells (T), smooth muscle cells (SMC),
  venular EC (Ven Endo), STEAP4+ perivascular cells (Pv STEAP4), stromal cells (stromal),
  macrophages (Macr), MYH11+ perivascular cells (Pv MYH11), unciliated epithelial
  cells (nCili Epi), arterial EC (Art Endo), fibroblasts (fibroblast). (B) The number
  of connections between different cell types in EnD of adenomyosis by CellphoneDB.
  (C) Heatmap of signal patterns of different cell types in EnC of adenomyosis shown
  by CellChat. (D) Heatmap of signal patterns of different cell types in EnD of adenomyosis
  shown by CellChat. (E) Bar graph shows the correlation of signaling pathway in EnC
  and EnD. (F) Circle plot showing the inferred PTN and TWEAK signaling networks between
  different cell types in EnC. (G) Circle plot showing the inferred WNT and IGF signaling
  networks between different cell types in both EnC and EnD. (H) Circle plot showing
  the inferred SPP1 and HH signaling networks between different cell types in EnD.'
