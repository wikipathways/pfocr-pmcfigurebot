caption: Schematic representation of PAR1- and PAR2-mediated signal transduction.
  PAR1 and PAR2 are G protein-coupled receptors that can be activated by thrombin
  and FXa, initiating a cascade of cellular responses. Upon cleavage, PAR1/2 interact
  with different G proteins like Gαi, Gα12/13, Gαs, and Gαq. Gα12/13 leads to Ras
  homolog family member A (RhoA) activation, via Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors
  (RhoGEFs) influencing cell hypertrophy. Gαq activates phospholipase C-β, generating
  second messengers that trigger calcium release and Protein Kinase C (PKC) activation.
  PKC can further activate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to
  upregulate production of SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) and A disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5). Gαi can inhibit adenylate
  cyclase (AC) to regulate downstream cAMP, whereas Gαs can increase cAMP. β-arrestin
  can activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway but exhibits inhibitory effects on PKC
  and calcium release. Anticoagulants like dabigatran (thrombin inhibitor) and apixaban,
  edoxaban, and rivaroxaban (FXa inhibitors) can potentially disrupt this signaling
  by preventing PAR activation. Ultimately, these signal transduction pathways can
  trigger physiological changes like inflammatory and immune responses, cell hypertrophy,
  and cell migration
