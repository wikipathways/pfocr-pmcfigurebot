caption: 'Summary of results and lipid mediator metabolism pathways in lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS)-stimulated CVO cultures: simplified pathway models of polyunsaturated fatty
  acids’ (PUFA) metabolism with literature-based “checkpoint” enzymes; n-6 fatty acids
  (linoleic acid, yellow; arachidonic acid, red) and n-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic
  acid, green; docosahexaenoic acid, blue) are metabolized by the same enzymes: cyclooxygenases
  (COX), lipoxygenases (LOX), cytochrome P450 monoxygenases (CYP450), and epoxide
  hydrolase 2 (Ephx2). Other pathway enzymes are not displayed for better visualization.
  Increased or decreased levels of metabolites in supernatants or cells’ mRNA expression
  of enzymes are displayed by arrows (increased ↑, decreased ↓). Substrates (fatty
  acids) and enzymes not measured by us are visualized in color (fatty acids) or in
  italic with an asterisk (*). Colored lines depict metabolic pathways via enzymes
  to produce oxylipins from their substrates. Sensory circumventricular organ (sCVO)-derived
  primary cell cultures were pre-incubated with PUFA (each 50 µmol/L). LPS-induced
  (10 µg/mL) inflammatory stimulation of cell cultures for 4 h induced mRNA expression
  of COX-2 and decreased mRNA expression of Ephx2. ALOX15 expression was not affected
  by LPS stimulation. Enzymes’ activity led to altered release of lipid metabolites
  into supernatants, as depicted by arrows. Arachidonic acid-derived metabolites were
  elevated in LPS-stimulated samples: 15-HETE (hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid); 8,15-DiHETE
  (dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid), 15-OxoETE (oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid); 5-OxoETE;
  11,12-DHET (dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid); 14,15-DHET; 15d-PGJ2 (15-Deoxy-Delta-12,14-prostaglandin-J2).
  The arachidonic acid metabolite 18-HETE was reduced in LPS-stimulated samples when
  compared to controls. Linoleic acid metabolites were increased in supernatants by
  LPS: 13-HODE (hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid); 9,10-DiHOME (dihydroxy-octadecenoic
  acid); 12,13-DiHOME. Eicosapentaenoic acid metabolites LXA5 (Lipoxin A5) and 18-HEPE
  (hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid) were elevated in supernatants of LPS-stimulated
  cells, whereas 8-HEPE, 9-HEPE, and 12-HEPE levels were reduced due to LPS stimulation
  versus controls. Docosahexaenoic-derived NPD1 (neuroprotectin D1) was observed to
  be increased by LPS stimulation. Metabolic pathways are visualized according to
  [,,].'
