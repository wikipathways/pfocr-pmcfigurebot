figure_title: The therapeutic mechanism of polyphenols for ASD.
caption: The therapeutic mechanism of polyphenols for ASD. ASD is caused by decreased
  levels of SIRT-1. Decreased SIRT-1 expression may increase NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation
  and mitochondrial bursting. PGC-1α is a major regulator of mitochondrial bursting,
  ultimately elevating the levels of ROS, leading to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation,
  resulting in the development of ASD. Baicalin stimulates SIRT1/PGC-1α, decreasing
  mitochondrial bursting and the levels of ROS. Resveratrol activates AMPK and SIRT-1,
  which decreases the levels of ROS and neuroinflammation. Hesperidin inhibits oxidative
  stress and neuroinflammation via the NF-κB pathway
