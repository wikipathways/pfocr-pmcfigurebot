caption: Schematic diagram representing cardioprotective molecular mechanisms of GLP-1
  analogs in cardiomyocytes. The GLP-1R-dependent and -independent signaling pathways
  have been described as contributing to healthy myocardium and heart functions under
  pathophysiological conditions. The binding of GLP-1 to its receptor activates adenylate
  cyclase, and cAMP levels are elevated, which is followed by the activation of downstream
  cAMP sensitive molecular effectors in a GLP-1R-dependent way. While GLP-1R-independent
  GLP-1(9-36) activates PI3K, Akt, and the downstream signaling pathway, the full
  mechanisms of this process are not yet known. GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; cAMP,
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; Akt, protein kinase B; Epac, exchange protein activated
  by cAMP; CREB, cAMP-response element binding protein; CaMKKβ, calcium ions/calmodulins
  dependent protein kinase kinases β; PINK1, PTEN-induced kinase 1; Mfn, Mitofusin;
  Drp, dynamin-related protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; eNOS, endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase
