figure_title: Impact of acetic acid/acetate on peripheral vasculature and the regulation
  of cardiovascular function.
caption: 'Impact of acetic acid/acetate on peripheral vasculature and the regulation
  of cardiovascular function. (A) Major metabolic pathway for ethanol metabolism (box
  in purple highlights potential chemoreceptor−stimulating pathways). Auto−oxidation
  (denoted [O]) of acetaldehyde, which can be increased by the presence of Fe3+ to
  form peracetic acid (peroxyacetic acid). Peracetic acid decomposes to acetic acid,
  generating hydrogen peroxide. (B) Acetate stimulates eNOS in the peripheral vasculature,
  which increases production of the powerful vasodilator, nitric oxide. (C) Schematic
  of the location of peripheral arterial baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, their innervation
  to the brainstem, and their relationship with neural control of autonomic function.
  Abbreviations: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), cytochrome P450 (CYP 450), aldehyde
  dehydrogenase (ALDH), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), nitric oxide (NO),
  rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), intermediolateral column (IML), sympathetic
  nerve activity (SNA)'
