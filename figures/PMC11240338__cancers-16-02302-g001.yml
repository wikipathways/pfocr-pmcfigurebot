caption: A standardized pipeline for simulating metabolism identified metabolic commonalities
  and differences across 10,915 patients from 34 cancer types. (A) Study overview.
  RNA-seq and reaction kinetic data were downloaded from the TCGA, MMRF-COMMPASS,
  and BRENDA databases. Genome-scale metabolic modeling using the GECKO algorithm
  was performed to characterize individual metabolic profiles for each patient from
  RNA expression profiles. Finally, survival analyses were performed to associate
  metabolic activities with survival within cancer types. (B) Metabolic specific growth
  rates (SGRs) across 34 cancer types showed a significant overlap in growth rates
  across cancer types. (C) Metabolic heterogeneity was governed by a combination of
  SGR, glycolysis pathway activity, and oxidative phosphorylation pathway activity.
  Highest SGR tumors have high activity of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation
  pathways. (D) Specific cancer types tend to occupy characteristic regions of the
  glycolysis/oxidative phosphorylation space. GBM and BRCA tend to have high glycolysis,
  and low oxidative phosphorylation. LUAD has a range of glycolysis and oxidative
  phosphorylation. PRAD tends to have higher oxidative phosphorylation and low glycolysis
