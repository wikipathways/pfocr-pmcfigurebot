caption: Characterization of cell communications among microglia. (A) The number and
  strength of intercellular ligand–receptor interactions in the MPTP and Con. (B)
  Heatmaps of the interaction numbers (left) and strengths (right) in the MPTP and
  Con groups. (C) Heatmaps of the overall signaling pathway for each cell in Con (left)
  and MPTP (right). (D) Circle plots show the IGF signaling pathway among microglia
  and other cells in the Con group. (E) Circle plots show the AGRN signaling pathway
  among microglia and other cells in the Con (left) and MPTP (right) groups. (F) Circle
  plots show the PTN signaling pathway among microglia and other cells in the Con
  (left) and MPTP (right) groups.
