caption: KEGG pathway analysis of glycolysis in B. coli based on the DEGs of the set
  TS vs. NS. The red and green colors represent the up- and downregulations of genes
  involved in the glycolysis pathway. The genes related to glucokinase, glycogen phosphorylase,
  glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, and 6-phosphofructokinase were upregulated in expression
  in the glycolysis pathway of B. coli
