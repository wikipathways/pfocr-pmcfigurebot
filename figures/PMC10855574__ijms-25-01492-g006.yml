caption: Differential metabolite analysis and functional enrichment. The PLS-DA analysis
  and the validation analysis of the permutation test in CH72 (A) and ZC17 (B). Histograms
  of the top 10 metabolites with the largest fold change in terms of up- and down-regulated
  differences in CH72 (C) and ZC17 (D). The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis bar graphs
  showed the top 10 pathways that were most significantly enriched (with the smallest
  p-value) in CH72 (E) and ZC17 (F), respectively, in reverse order of the number
  of DEMs
