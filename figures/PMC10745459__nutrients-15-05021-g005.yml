figure_title: Effect of long-term oral administration of BGP on Pi3k/Akt signaling
  pathway and TGF-β1 level in SHR rats.
caption: 'Effect of long-term oral administration of BGP on Pi3k/Akt signaling pathway
  and TGF-β1 level in SHR rats. Note: (A) The protein bands (Pi3k, Akt, and p-Akt)
  in Western blot analysis; (B) expression levels of TGF-β1; (C) expression levels
  of Pi3K; (D) expression levels of Akt; (E) expression levels of p-Akt; WKY-NCG:
  0.9% saline (n = 6), SHR-NCG: 0.9% saline (n = 6), SHR-LPG: low dose BGP group-100
  mg/kg BW (n = 6), SHR-HPG: high dose BGP group-200 mg/kg BW (n = 6), SHR-PCG: captopril-10.0
  mg/kg BW (n = 6); * and ** indicate significant difference (p < 0.05) and extremely
  significant difference (p < 0.01) compared to SHR-NCG group. # and ## indicate significant
  difference (p < 0.05) and extremely significant difference (p < 0.01) compared to
  SHR-PCG group. ++ indicates an extremely significant difference (p < 0.01) from
  the WKY-NCG group. ns indicates no significant difference between different groups
  (p > 0.05)'
