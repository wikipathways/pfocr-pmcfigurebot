figure_title: CellChat reveals TBXT-driven regulation of cell-cell adhesions and ncWNT
  signaling across and within clusters
caption: (A) Bar plot comparing information flow (A. U.) of key pathways between WT,
  TBXT-Het, and TBXT-KO. (B) Circle plots visualizing communication between or within
  clusters for the CADM, JAM, and ncWNT signaling pathways. Numbers correlate with
  cluster identity, while line thickness corresponds to the strength of predicted
  communication. “9” indicates the mesoderm cluster. Small circle plots under the
  “ncWNT Signaling Pathway” header depict interactions between WNT5A and designated
  FZD receptors. (C) Heatmap showing the communication dynamics for each genotype
  for the CADM, JAM, and ncWNT signaling pathways. (D) Bubble plot comparing predicted
  ligand-receptor interactions for CADM, JAM, WNT, and ncWNT pathways. Only ligand-receptor
  interactions with variability in communication probability are shown
