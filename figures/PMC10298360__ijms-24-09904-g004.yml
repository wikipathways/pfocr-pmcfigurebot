figure_title: CXCL5 activates the signaling pathway via CXCR2.
caption: 'CXCL5 activates the signaling pathway via CXCR2. (A) Cells were treated
  with 30 ng/mL CXCL5 for the indicated periods. Representative Western blots of p-Akt,
  Akt, p-ERK, ERK, p-p38, p38, p-c-Jun, and c-Jun in VSMCs are shown in the left panel.
  The right panel is the quantification of phosphorylated p-Akt, p-ERK, p-p38, and
  p-c-Jun normalized to total protein. All values are presented as mean ± SD. * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 versus control; N.S.: not significant. (B)
  VSMCs were treated with 100 ng/mL CXCL5 for 2 h or pretreated with 5 μM SB225002.
  p-Akt, p-ERK, p-p38, and p-c-Jun were assessed by Western blotting, followed by
  quantification and normalization by ImageJ. The right panel represents quantitative
  data of relative expression. All values are presented as mean ± standard deviation
  (SD). ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 versus non-treated control; ## p < 0.01 versus
