figure_title: Curcumin inhibits the TORC1 signaling pathway.
caption: 'Curcumin inhibits the TORC1 signaling pathway. (A) The growth assay was
  conducted using yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic background CEN.PK113-7D wildtype
  cells and mitochondrial-dysfunction mutants (pet100∆ and rmd9∆). They were treated
  with varying concentrations of curcumin for 72 h. Growth rates were normalized to
  the untreated control. The data are presented as means ± SD (n = 4). Statistical
  significance was determined as follows: * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001, and ns (non-significant)
  based on a two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. (B,C)
  Yeast exponential cultures of wildtype Sch9-6xHA-Tag cells were exposed to varying
  concentrations of curcumin and rapamycin for one hour. Subsequently, aliquots from
  these cultures were collected to extract proteins and RNA. (B) TORC1 activity was
  assessed by monitoring the phosphorylation of the Sch9 substrate through western
  blotting. (C) Expression analysis of SDH1 gene was analyzed by qRT-PCR of yeast
  cells treated with DMSO, curcumin, and rapamycin. Gene expression of curcumin- and
  rapamycin-treated samples were compared with DMSO control. Data are represented
  as means ± SD (n = 2). (B) * p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001, and ns (non-significant)
  based on an ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.
  (D) Wildtype and snf1∆ exponential cultures of Sch9-6xHA-Tag were treated with different
  concentrations of curcumin for the indicated times. Aliquots of the cultures were
  collected to prepare protein extracts, and TORC1 activity was assessed by monitoring
  the phosphorylation of the substrate, Sch9, through western blotting'
