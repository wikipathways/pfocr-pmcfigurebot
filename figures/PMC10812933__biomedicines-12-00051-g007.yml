caption: 'CTRP13 suppresses UUO-induced NF-κB p65 signaling pathway activation. (A)
  Representative Western blot analysis of P65 and phosphorylated p65 in the kidney
  of UUO mice. (B) Representative immunofluorescence staining of phosphorylated p65
  in the kidney of UUO mice. Scale bar = 50 μm. * p < 0.05 versus Sham+Vehicle or
  Vehicle (UUO) group. # p < 0.05 versus UUO+Vehicle group'
