caption: Analysis of DEGs and DAMs involved in JAs synthesis pathway with CGMMV infection.
  (A) Scheme of the JAs synthesis pathway. DEGs and DAMs identified via transcriptome
  and metabolome analyses are marked in red. (B) qRT-PCR verification of the DEGs
  involved in the JAs synthesis pathway. Asterisks indicate the significance of difference
  between mock and CGMMV plants using Studentâ€™s t-test method. *** p < 0.001. (C)
  Comparison of the accumulation of JA and JA-Ile in mock and CGMMV-treated bottle
  gourd. *** p < 0.001
