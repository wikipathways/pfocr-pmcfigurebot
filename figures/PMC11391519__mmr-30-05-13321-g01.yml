figure_title: I/R injury inhibited the expression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
caption: I/R injury inhibited the expression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (A)
  The protein expression of PI3K and AKT and the activity of phosphorylated AKT in
  rat myocardium was detected by western blotting. (B) The protein expression of PI3K
  and AKT and the activity of phosphorylated AKT in H9C2 cells was detected by western
  blotting. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, n=3. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase; AKT,
  serine/threonine kinase; NC, negative control; H/R, hypoxia and reoxygenation
