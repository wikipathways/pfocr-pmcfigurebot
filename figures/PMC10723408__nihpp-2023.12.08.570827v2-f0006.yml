figure_title: Insights into metabolic pathway regulation through flux modulation ratio
  analysis
caption: (A) & (C) Scatter plot and boxplot distribution for the first biological
  replicate, respectively. These depict variations in flux modulation ratios, highlighting
  tightly regulated (red cluster) and flexible metabolic reactions (green and blue
  clusters). The figures represent three distinct partitioning of flux modulations.
  (B) & (D) Scatter plot and boxplot distribution for the second biological replicate.
  The boxplot distributions of flux modulation provide a view of metabolic congruence
  or divergence. While there are slight differences between the two replicates, these
  are deemed insignificant and are likely due to noise effects in the measurements.
  Key reaction players remain consistent across both replicates
