caption: Metabolic reprogramming of malignant cells in human liver cancer. (A,B) Heat
  maps illustrating metabolic pathway enrichment for major cell types and malignant
  cell subclusters. (C,D) Quantitative violin plots demonstrating metabolic activity
  for major cell types and malignant cell subclusters. (Eâ€“G) Pseudotime trajectory
  differentiation plots for malignant cell subclusters (1, 2, 3 means branch point).
