caption: qPCR-based verification analysis of the expression of genes involved in ABA
  synthesis and sucrose metabolism-related pathways in the leaf sheath of B03S. (A)
  Analysis of the expression of seven genes involved in the ABA synthesis pathway.
  (B) Analysis of the expression of ten genes involved in the sucrose metabolism pathway.
  The internal reference gene used was OsActin1. Bars represent means plus the standard
  error (n = 3). Means followed by the same letter are not significantly different
  (p < 0.05) as determined by Duncanâ€™s multiple range test
