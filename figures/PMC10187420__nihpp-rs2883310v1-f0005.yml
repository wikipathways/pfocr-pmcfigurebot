figure_title: Cell annotation, marker gene feature plots, and endocannabinoid signaling
  pathway from neurons of PAG region cells in CFA-induced chronic inflammatory pain
  model with ApAP and SRP-001 treatments
caption: a, UMAP plots showing the distribution of annotated cell clusters color-coded
  by each cluster â€“ astrocytes, excitatory neurons, inhibitory interneurons, oligodendrocytes,
  oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC), and microglia, from the aggregated clusters
  of all the 4 samples. b-f, Marker gene feature plots showing selected distinctive
  marker genes used for cell annotation of single cell clusters into 6 different cellular
  subpopulations. b, Oligodendrocytes, c, Astrocytes, d, OPC, e, Glutamatergic neurons,
  and f, GABAergic neurons. g, Heatmap of DESeq2-normalized expression values from
  scRNA-seq data for genes involved in endocannabinoid signaling. h, Endocannabinoid
  signaling pathways generated by IPA with an overlay based on DESeq2-normalized expression
  values of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in neuronal clusters CFA_Vehicle
  vs CFA_SRP-001 treatments, respectively
