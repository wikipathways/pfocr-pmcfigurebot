figure_title: IFN-γ treatment disrupts epithelial barrier function in esophageal epithelium
caption: (A) Hierarchical clustering based on the leading edge of the positively enriched
  pathway, HALLMARK_APICAL_JUNCTION; heatmap showing gene expression levels across
  IFN-γ and IFN-α treated and unstimulated organoids. (B) IHC of tight junction proteins,
  Claudin 1 and Occludin in 3D organoids derived from EPC2-hTERT cells treated with
  IFN-α and IFN-γ. (C) Schematic depicting the ALI (Air-Liquid Interface) epithelial
  culture model. The culture spans days 1 to 7, facilitating proliferation and initial
  differentiation, followed by days 7 to 10, which support terminal differentiation.
  External stimuli are introduced into the basolateral media chamber from days 10
  to 14, enabling the evaluation of their impact on epithelial barrier function. (D)Transepithelial
  electrical resistance (TEER) was measured on day 14 and calculated as net resistance
  × membrane area (0.33cm2 for 24-well Millicell inserts), and only samples with TEER
  > 200 Ω*cm2 on day 10 were used for stimulation experiments. (n=6 wells per group,
  mean ± SD, * p-value < 0.05). (E) Basolateral translocation of 70kDa FITC-dextran
  across ALI membranes to assess the permeability upon IFN treatment (n=6 wells per
  group, mean ± SD, * p-value < 0.05)
