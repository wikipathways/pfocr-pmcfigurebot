figure_title: Effect of sodium sulphate on the FGF15/FGFR4-Klb/JNK signaling pathway
  in the livers of mice fed an HCD.
caption: 'Effect of sodium sulphate on the FGF15/FGFR4-Klb/JNK signaling pathway in
  the livers of mice fed an HCD. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR results of
  the relative mRNA expression levels of (A) Fgf15 in the ileum and of (B) Fgfr4 and
  (C) Klb in the liver tissues of mice from the five study groups: CON, HCD, HCD +
  LSS, HCD + MSS and HCD + HSS. (D) Western blotting results showing the protein expression
  level of KLB in the liver tissues of mice from the five groups. GAPDH was used as
  the internal control. The right panel shows the semi-quantitative analysis. (E)
  The p-JNK and JNK protein expression levels in the livers of mice from the five
  groups. The right panel shows the semi-quantitative analysis of the p-JNK/JNK ratio.
  (F) Western blotting results showing the p-c-Jun and c-Jun protein expression levels
  in the liver tissues of mice from the five groups. GAPDH was used as the internal
  control. ##P<0.01 vs. the CON group; *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. the HCD group.
  HCD, high cholesterol diet; CON, control; LSS, low dose of sodium sulphate; MSS,
  middle dose of sodium sulphate; HSS, high dose of sodium sulphate; FGF, fibroblast
  growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; KLB, Klotho Î²; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  p-, phosphorylated'
