figure_title: The underlying mechanism of Treg in skeletal muscle repair and regeneration
caption: After muscle injury, mMSCs secrete IL-33 which binds to ST receptors on Tregs
  causing Treg aggregation at the damaged site. IFN-γ produced by effector T cells
  causes polarization of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages
  and promotes the proliferation of satellite cells to facilitate tissue repair. Tregs
  also secrete Areg to influence the repair process by directly promoting the proliferation
  of satellite cells through the EGFR pathway. Areg inhibits Treg-regulated T cell
  differentiation to Th1 cells, thereby suppressing the local inflammatory response.
  Estrogen inhibits Th1 responses in damaged muscle by promoting Treg cell aggregation,
  thereby reducing inflammation in skeletal muscle. PD-1 downregulation affects Treg
  aggregation in skeletal muscle and impairs skeletal muscle regeneration, whereas
  CCL2 may potentially regulate Treg aggregation to affect the repair process. mMscs,
  muscle mesenchymal stem cells; CGRP, calcitonin gene related peptide; CCL2, chemokine
  ligand 2; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; Teff, effector T cell; NK cell, natural killer cell;
  Th1, T-helper 1 cell; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PD-1, programmed cell
  death ligand 1.
