  pathway.
caption: QPCR identification of the key genes participated in lignin biosynthesis
  pathway. The key genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, including (A) PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonialyase; (B) CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; (C) 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase; (D) COMT, caffeate/5-hydroxyferulate3-O-methyltransferase; (E) CSE, caffeoyl
  shikimate esterase; (F) CCoAOMT, caffeoyl CoA3-O-methyltransferase; were all upregulated
  in Piri and Piri + Fp treatments. Different small letters above the columns represent
  significant differences (p < 0.05)
