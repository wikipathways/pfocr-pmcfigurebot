figure_title: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of gingival and synovial cells
caption: (A) Experimental design.(B and C) Two-dimensional UMAP representation of
  69,509 cells, according to (B) sample origin and results of clustering and (C) results
  of annotation.(D) Heatmap visualization of the distribution of sequenced cells in
  gingiva (top left) and synovium (top right) and cluster analysis of cell types in
  gingiva (bottom left) and synovium (bottom right), normalized for the number of
  cells per sample in the dataset.(E and F) CellChat analysis of intercellular communication
  networks in CD45.2+ (mutant) and CD45.1+ (WT) cells from 10%Dnmt3aR878H/+BMT mice.(E)
  Heatmap of differential number and strength of possible interactions between any
  two of the indicated analyzed cell populations in gingiva (red, increased interaction
  in mutant cells; blue, increased interaction in WT cells).(F) Visualization of the
  overall information flow of each indicated signaling pathway by calculating the
  sum of communication probability among all pairs of synovial cell groups in the
  inferred network. The red and green colors indicate increased enrichment in mutant
  or WT cells, respectively.(G and H) Gene expression levels in distinctly defined
  CD45.2+ cell types from gingiva (G) or synovium (H).(I) List of gingival upregulated
  enriched genes in CD45.2+ (Dnmt3aR878H/+) cells in the indicated KEGG pathway terms
  analyzed by STRING.(J and K) Top 10 significantly enriched GO terms sorted by PANTHER
  based on significantly upregulated or downregulated genes (in 10%Dnmt3aR878H/+BMT-CD45.2
  vs. 10%Dnmt3a+/+BMT-CD45.2) in neutrophils and T cells from gingiva (J) and synovium
  (K) (Fisher test with FDR-correction, p < 0.05).See also Figures S2 and S3
