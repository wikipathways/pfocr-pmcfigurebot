caption: 'TP53 + RAD51D knockdown upregulated IL-17 signaling pathway. (A,B) We utilized
  qRT-PCR to evaluate the expression of IL-17A (A) and IL-17C (B) in FTE and HGSOC
  tissues. (C) IHC staining of IL-17C in FTE and HGSOC tissues. Scale bar: 100 μm.
  (D) Cell viability of WT and TP53 + RAD51D-KD organoids after IL-17A treatment for
  72 h (0, 10, and 50 ng/mL). (E) ELISA of CXCL1 in 72 h conditioned media supernatants
  from the indicated organoids. (F) qRT-PCR was utilized to assess the mRNA level
  of IL-17 signaling pathway-related genes in TP53 ± RAD51D-KD organoids (n = 6).
