caption: Venn diagram showing co-occurrence of active inflammatory signaling pathways
  in sarcoidosis patients (n = 60). Every circle represents one of the pathways, with
  overlapping sections representing tissue sections with a positive expression of
  two or more signaling pathways. Numbers represent percentage of patients with a
  positive expression of one or more signaling pathways. In total, 85.0% of patients
  were shown to be positive for the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway compared
  to 50.8% positive for mTORC1 and 50.0% positive for JAK/STAT
