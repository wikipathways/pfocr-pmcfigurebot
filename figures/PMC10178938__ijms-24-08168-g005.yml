figure_title: The putative phenylpropanoid biosynthesis metabolic pathway of E.
caption: The putative phenylpropanoid biosynthesis metabolic pathway of E. ulmoides
  was constructed based on KEGG annotation. These unigenes are distributed in the
  rectangular boxes in the figure. Red indicates the key up-regulated genes associated
  with the lignin metabolic pathway, purple indicates down-regulated genes, and white
  indicates both up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes
