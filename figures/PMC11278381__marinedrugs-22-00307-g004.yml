caption: Recombinant virus oncoVV-AVL promoted lipid synthesis by regulating the ROS/NRF2/FASN
  signaling pathway. The expression levels of NRF2 and FASN in PLC/PRF/5 (A,C) and
  Huh7 (B) cells were detected by Western blot at 36 h p.i. (C) PLC/PRF/5 cells were
  treated with PBS, oncoVV (MOI = 2), oncoVV-AVL (MOI = 2), or in combination with
  NADPH (100 uM). GAPDH was measured as a loading control
