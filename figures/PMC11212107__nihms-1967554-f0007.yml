figure_title: Socs36E and Et regulate sweet and fatty acid perception
caption: (A) Schematic of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Both the short receptor
  Et and the downstream JAK/STAT mediator Socs36E act as negative regulators of the
  JAK/STAT pathway.(B) 1% C6 PER of Gr64f-Gal4>et-IR and Gr64f-Gal4>Socs36E-IR flies
  compared to et-IR/+ and Socs36E-IR/+ flies, fed control diet (CD, gray) and high-fat
  diet (HFD, yellow). n = 20. Median (midline) and 75% quantiles (dashed lines) are
  depicted.(C) Gr64f-Gal4>Socs36E-IR flies on CD show decreased sugar PER (filled
  line) compared to genetic control flies (Gr64f-Gal4/+ and socs36E-IR/+, dotted lines).
  n = 20.(D) Gr64f-Gal4>Socs36E-IR flies on CD (gray line) and HFD (yellow line) show
  similar sugar PER. n = 20.(E) HFD-fed Gr64f-Gal4>Socs36E-IR show lower sugar PER
  compared to the genetic controls (Gr64f-Gal4/+ and Socs36E-IR/+, dotted lines);
  n = 20.(F) Sugar PER of Gr64f-Gal4>et-IR and genetic control (Gr64f-Gal4 and et-IR/+)
  flies exposed to CD (gray) and HFD (yellow). n = 20. Median (midline) and 75% quantiles
  (dashed lines) are depicted. Data are presented as means Â± SEM. PER data were non-normally
  distributed. Statistical analysis was performed via Mann-Whitney tests (B, D, and
  F) or Kruskal-Wallis H tests (C and E). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p
  < 0.0001
