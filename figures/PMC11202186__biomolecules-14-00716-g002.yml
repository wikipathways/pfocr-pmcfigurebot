caption: TSS coverage was distinct between cancer and non-cancer samples. (A) Principal
  Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated clear group separation between lung cancer
  and healthy individuals based on TSS coverage values. (B) A volcano plot of differentially
  expressed genes between lung cancer and healthy individuals, derived from TCGA RNA-seq
  data, highlighted 1241 genes identified using TSS values, indicating their potential
  role in lung cancer development. (C) Gene enrichment analysis identified the top
  25 pathways associated with differentially expressed TSSs between cancer and non-cancer
  samples, including pathways specifically related to lung cancer (e.g., “Non-small
  cell lung cancer” and “ErbB signaling pathway”) and other pathways related to cancer
  development. (D) Differences in TSS between healthy individuals and lung cancer
  patients were observed among the filtered 200 features selected for dimensionality
  reduction in the model, suggesting their potential utility in constructing a lung
  cancer screening model
