figure_title: DNA methylation drives transcriptomic dysregulation in BOS samples and
  identifies common dysregulated transcripts enriched in Wnt signaling genes
caption: (A) Integration of patient blood samples across DNAm (BOS n = 13, control
  n = 26) and RNA transcriptomic (BOS n = 8, control n = 11) dysregulation identified
  672 differentially methylated CpG sites (Padj < 0.05) that correlated to 341 RNA-seq
  DEGs (Padj < 0.05). These significant DEGs were further filtered for RNA-seq abs(log2FC)
  ≥ 0.58, and DNAm abs(Δβ) ≥ 0.05, shown by the dotted red lines. After filtering,
  we retained 50 of 672 CpG sites (7.44%) and 24 of 341 unique genes (7.04%). (B)
  Analysis of enriched biological processes identified canonical Wnt signaling, anterior-posterior
  body patterning, regulation of neuron projection development, and other biologically
  relevant pathways. (C) In BOS patients, PSMA8, which encodes a key component of
  the β-catenin destruction complex, is hypermethylated in blood DNAm across 8 CpG
  sites (Δβ 6.1% to 18.9%) and (D) shows strong downregulation in blood RNA-seq (log2FC
  = –2.92). Control sample–normalized counts ranged from 0 to 17.7 (whiskers), with
  a mean (horizontal line) of 8.1, and quartile bounds (box limits) of 4.6 and 10.8.
  BOS normalized sample counts ranged from 0 to 2.1, with a mean of 0.8, and quartile
  bounds of 0 and 1.5
