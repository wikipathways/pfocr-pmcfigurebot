figure_title: Identification of major signaling changes after the OV-mOX40L therapy.
caption: 'Identification of major signaling changes after the OV-mOX40L therapy. A)
  Normalized interactions were summed as the overall information flow and significantly
  different signaling pathways were identified between the PBS and OV-mOX40L groups.
  B) The overall signaling patterns among our defined cell clusters in the PBS group
  and the OV-mOX40L group. C and D) The inferred IL6:IL6R/gp130 (C) and PDCD1: PD-L1
  (D) signaling network among the cell populations represented by the nodes. The edge
  width represents the interaction strength of the specific pathway'
