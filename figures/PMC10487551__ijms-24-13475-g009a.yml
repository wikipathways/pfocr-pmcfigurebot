caption: The top 50 pathways involving differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the
  different comparison groups, according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG). Two wheat lines, Dikemai1 (D) and Yunmai 0606 (Y), at two phenological maturation
  stages, waxy grain (WG) and mature grain (MG), were compared. The horizontal axis
  of each graph represents the number of DEGs involved in a specific pathway, and
  the enriched KEGG pathways are listed on the vertical axis. To the right of each
  figure, the pathway classifications are indicated. (A) DWG vs. DMG, (B) YWG vs.
  YMG, (C) DWG vs. YWG, and (D) DMG vs. YMG
