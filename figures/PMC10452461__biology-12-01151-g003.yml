figure_title: Fusobacterium affects chemotherapy drugs.
caption: 'Fusobacterium affects chemotherapy drugs. Co-culture with Fusobacterium
  nucleatum can enhance the vitality of cancer cells, reduce cell apoptosis, antagonize
  5-FU, and enhance chemotherapy resistance and cancer cell proliferation. This is
  related to the overactivation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, which upregulates
  the ABC transporters (MRP1 and P-gp). LRP: lipoprotein receptor-related protein.
