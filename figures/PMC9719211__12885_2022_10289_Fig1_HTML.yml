caption: 'Genetic or pharmacological ISR inhibition sensitizes CML cells to imatinib
  in vitro and in vivo. A The levels of PERK, eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α (S51P)
  protein estimated by western blot in wild-type (wt), or stably transfected eIF2α
  S51A and S51A shUTR K562 mutants. Arrows indicate wt (lower) and mutated (40 kDa
  higher) eIF2α bands. Tubulin was used as a loading control. The full-length membranes
  were properly cut based on the protein marker size according to target protein sites
  prior to hybridization with primary antibodies (see Materials and Methods). Cropped
  blots are presented; original non-cropped membranes are shown in the Supplementary
  Fig. S. B Apoptotic (Annexin V-positive) cells detected by flow cytometry in K562
  wt, eIF2αS51A and S51A shUTR mutant cells in untreated conditions or after treatment
  with 0,5 and 1 μM imatinib. Data are shown as a percentage of dead cells. Statistical
  analysis: Unpaired Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction (*p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.005;
  *** p ≤ 0.0005). C Schematic graph of the integrated stress response (ISR) signaling
  pathway with the site of ISR inhibitors - ISRIB and GSK157 action (PKR – Protein
  Kinase R, PERK – PKR-like ER kinase, HRI – Heme-regulated eIF2α kinase, GCN2 – General
  Control Non-depressible protein 2, eIF2α – eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α,
  ATF4 – Activating Transcription Factor 4, CHOP – CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein
  (C/EBP) homologous protein, GADD34 – Growth Arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein
  34, PP1 – protein phosphatase 1). D CHOP and GADD34 mRNA expression levels measured
  by RT-qPCR. Wild-type K562 cells were preconditioned with either ISRIB or GSK157
  inhibitors in indicated concentrations for 2 hours, followed by ISR induction with
  100 nM thapsigargin for 2 hours to mimic ISR in vitro. For mRNA analysis the level
  of not treated cells (control) was used as a reference =1. Statistical analysis:
  unpaired Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction and p ≤ 0,05 was estimated as
  significant (*p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.005; ***p ≤ 0.001; ****p ≤ 0.0005). E The workflow
  of the in vivo Xenograft experiment. Mice were: not treated (n = 12); or treated
  with: imatinib (n = 14); imatinib and GSK157 (n = 13); imatinib and ISRIB (n = 12).
  F Left panel - the number of mice which developed tumors upon all tested conditions.
  Right panel – pictures of tumors isolated form representative experiment (n = 5
  mice for each condition). G The tumor mass indicating viability and proliferation
  potential isolated from mice in indicated variants. Tumors grown in mice injected
  with K562 cells and treated with imatinib were used as a control = 100%. Statistical
  analysis: Unpaired Student’s t-test, F-test to compare variances (*p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.005)'
