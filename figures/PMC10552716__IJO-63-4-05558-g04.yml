figure_title: NQO1 activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to regulate cell proliferation,
  movement and the EMT process.
caption: 'NQO1 activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to regulate cell proliferation,
  movement and the EMT process. (A) Expression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway markers was
  detected by western blotting in the four groups of GBM cells. β-actin was used as
  the loading control. Effects of LY294002 and Rapamycin on the proliferation of NQO1-overexpressing
  cells were detected using (B) MTT, (C) colony formation and (D) EdU assays. Effects
  of LY294002 and Rapamycin on the mobilty of NQO1-overexpressing cells were determined
  using (E) wound healing (scale bar: 50 μm) and (F) Transwell assays (scale bar:
  25 μm). (G) Expression levels of EMT markers (E-cadherin and Vimentin) in the four
  groups of GBM cells were detected using immunofluorescence staining. Scale bar:
  50 μm (right), 25 μm (left). Red staining indicates Vimentin, green staining indicates
  E-cadherin, blue staining indicates DAPI. (H) Expression levels of EMT markers and
  PAM pathway markers were detected using western blotting in the four groups of GBM
  cells. β-actin was used as a loading control. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone
