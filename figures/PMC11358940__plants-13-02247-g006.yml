caption: (A) Concentrations of the endogenous hormones, i.e., ABA, JA, and IAA, in
  the leaves of high and low biomass F2 segregants. Bar charts present the means with
  error bars showing standard errors, different letters are based on one-way ANOVA
  and LSD tests at Î± = 0.05. (B) Linear regression model of hormone content and qPCR
  values of the genes identified in RNA-Seq. analysis in the respective signaling
  pathway
