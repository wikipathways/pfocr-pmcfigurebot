caption: 'Potential drug resistance genes among 154 co-culture significant genes.
  (A) Hierarchical clustering heatmap of 154 co-culture significant genes. Yellow
  box indicates commonly upregulated genes, and blue box indicates commonly downregulated
  genes. Red indicates upregulation, and blue indicates downregulation. (B) GO enrichment
  analysis of up- and downregulated genes. Red pie indicates downregulated genes,
  and blue pie indicates upregulated genes. (C) Selected groups of proteinâ€“protein
  interaction (PPI) analysis by physical affinity (STRING physical score > 0.132).
  (D) Functional enrichment analysis of selected genes by STRING. Pathways represent
  GO: 0006952, defense response (red spheres); GO: 0050896, response to stimulus (yellow
  spheres); GO: 0002831, regulation of response to biotic stimulus (green spheres);
  and GO: 0019221, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway (blue spheres)'
