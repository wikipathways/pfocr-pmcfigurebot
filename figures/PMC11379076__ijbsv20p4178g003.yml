caption: The Interaction between mTOR pathway and HCC. HBx activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway by increasing the expression of AFP and activating IKKÎ², which
  encourages malignant transformation. Besides, the accumulation of mutant L-HBsAg
  and excessive L-HBsAg could also activate the mTOR signaling pathway. Then the activated
  mTOR promotes carcinogenic-related life activities, such as aerobic glycolysis,
  angiogenesis, lipogenesis, migration, inflammation, and cell cycle
