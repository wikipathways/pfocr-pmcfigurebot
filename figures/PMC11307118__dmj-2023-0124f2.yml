figure_title: Deficiency of asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) improved hepatic
  and hepatocellular insulin sensitivity.
caption: Deficiency of asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) improved hepatic and
  hepatocellular insulin sensitivity. (A) Western blot of key proteins in insulin
  signal pathway in liver. Representative images of the band and grey intensity of
  each band with insulin stimulation were shown (n=3). (B) Western blot of insulin-protein
  kinase B (AKT) signal pathway in the adipose and muscle tissues. Representative
  images of the band and grey intensity of phosphorylation of protein kinase B (pS-473)
  (pAKT) with insulin stimulation were shown (n=3). (C) Western blot analysis for
  insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor β (pInsRβ) and AKT in HepG2
  and ASGR1-/- HepG2 cells. Representative images of the band and grey intensity of
  pAKT with insulin stimulation were shown (n=3). All data are shown as the mean±standard
  deviation. GLN, glucosamine (18 mM). aP<0.05, bP<0.01, as compared to the indicated
  wild type (WT) by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) among three groups. Statistical
  significance between two groups was assessed with an unpaired, 2-tailed t-test
