caption: 'CREB3 suppresses growth and metastasis of HCC through AKT signaling pathway.
  (A) Heat map displaying the DEGs between Ctrl and CREB3 overexpression of HLF cells.
  (B) GO analysis of DEGs were shown. Protein kinase B signaling related terms are
  marked in red. (C) Western blotting analysis of indicated protein in CREB3 stably
  knocked down or overexpressed HCC cells. (D) Representative western blotting images
  of indicated protein in clinical HCC samples. Scatterplots showing the robust correlation
  of CREB3 and p‐AKT (Ser473)/AKT protein expression. Expression of CREB3, p‐AKT (Ser473),
  and AKT were normalized to GAPDH. (E) HLF cells with or without knockdown of CREB3
  were injected subcutaneously (n = 7) or intravenously (n = 8) into BALB/c nude mice.
  Seven days later, mice were injected intratumorally or intraperitoneally with oil
  or LY294002 twice a week. (F) Image of subcutaneous tumors from HLF cells with or
  without CREB3 stably knocked down injected with or without LY294002. (G) Statistical
  comparison of tumors weight and volume of indicated groups were performed. (H) Representative
  images of Ki67, CREB3, and p‐AKT (Ser473) staining of subcutaneous tumors in the
  indicated groups. Scale bar: 20 µm. (I) Quantification of Ki67+ HCC cell percentages,
  CREB3, and p‐AKT (Ser473) IHC scores in indicated groups (n = 3). (J) Representative
  images and statistical comparison of lung metastatic nodules in CREB3 control or
  knocked down nude mice with or without LY294002 injection. (K) Representative images
  of H&E, CREB3 staining in lung metastatic nodules of the indicated groups. Scale
  bar: 2 mm (upper), 200 µm (middle), 20 µm (lower). Quantification of CREB3 IHC scores
  was shown (n = 3). Data were represented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. sh,
