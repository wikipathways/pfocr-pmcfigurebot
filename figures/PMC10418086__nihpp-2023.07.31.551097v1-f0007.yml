figure_title: Differentially associated genes with age in astrocytes and microglia
  overlap with immune response, aging and disease gene sets
caption: |-
  (a) GSE of aDAGs in astrocytes for Aging and Disease Perturbations from GEO gene sets. Top 10 most significant GO terms are shown. For a full list, see Supplementary Information.(b) Dotplot of increased expression and/or percentage of astrocytes expressing complement, immune, and gliosis genes.(c) Feature scatter showing increased expression and association of complement pathway genes C1S, (d)
  C3, and (e)
  CFI in aged astrocytes.(f) GSE of aDAGs in microglia for “GO: Biological Process” and “Aging and Disease Perturbations from GEO” gene sets. Top 10 most significant GO terms are shown. For a full list, see Supplementary Information.(g) Dotplot showing significant changes in expression and/or percentage of microglia expressing immune response or (h) DAM genes(i) Feature plots showing significant increases and associations of CD74, (j)
