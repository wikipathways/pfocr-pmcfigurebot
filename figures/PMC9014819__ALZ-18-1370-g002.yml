caption: A priori hypothesized biomarker pathways by which amyloid beta (Aβ)–tau–atrophy
  biomarkers might mediate the association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors
  and cognition. Rectangles represent manifest variables and ellipses represent latent
  variables. Each single‐headed arrow denotes a hypothesized unidirectional effect
  of one variable on another. For graphical simplicity, age, sex, education, and apolipoprotein
  E (APOE) ε4 is grouped although each AD risk factor is separately hypothesized to
  have unidirectional effect on white matter lesion (WML), cortical Aβ burden, tau
  latent variable (LV), atrophy LV, and cognitive outcome. Our analysis is premised
  on a conceptual Aβ–tau–atrophy pathologic pathway thought to mediate the association
  of AD risk factors and cognition. A priori, age, sex, years of education, and presence
  of APOE ε4 allele were specified to have direct effects on global Aβ, regional tau,
  regional atrophy, and WML, in addition to their direct effects on cognition. WML
  was hypothesized to have a direct effect on global Aβ, regional tau, and regional
  atrophy, in addition to its direct effect on cognition. Global Aβ was hypothesized
  to have a direct effect on regional tau and regional atrophy, in addition to its
  direct effect on cognition. In turn, the regional tau was hypothesized to have direct
  effect on regional atrophy, together with the direct effects of regional tau and
  regional atrophy on cognition. We note that the regional specificity of Aβ pathology
  was examined by including regional Aβ burden from all 31 ROIs instead of limiting
  the Aβ construct to the global cortical Aβ burden in the partial least squares structural
  equation modeling (PLS‐SEM). The estimated latent construct for the regional Aβ
  burden in the final PLS‐SEM involved all but bilateral entorhinal, amygdala, and
  hippocampus regions, suggesting the effect of Aβ being distributed across the cortex
  rather than localized in specific cortical regions in this cohort of all Aβ‐positive
  individuals. Therefore, Aβ construct of all PLS‐SEMs in this study was limited to
  global cortical Aβ burden.
