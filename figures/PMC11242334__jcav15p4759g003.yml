caption: Integration of WGCNA modules with differential expression analysis and subsequent
  pathway enrichment. A. Intersection of module genes from WGCNA with previously identified
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs), focusing on genes central to the network
  and differentially expressed. B. Disease Ontology (DO) enrichment analysis demonstrating
  the strong association of these genes with thyroid malignancies, especially papillary
  thyroid carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma in general. C. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
  analysis highlighting the genes' predominant roles in wound healing and the positive
  regulation of kinase activity. D. KEGG pathway analysis identifying multiple signaling
  pathways associated with these genes, underscoring their relevance to the oncogenic
  processes in thyroid cancer
