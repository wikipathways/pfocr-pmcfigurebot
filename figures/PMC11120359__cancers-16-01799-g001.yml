caption: 'Representation of the signaling pathway in the activation of CXCR4 (left)
  and ACKR3 (right). Blue arrows mean activation while red arrows represent metabolic
  pathway inhibition. Note that G proteins and calcium do not participate as second
  messengers after binding CXCL12 to ACKR3. Acronyms: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand
  12 (CXCL12), chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4), atypical cytokine receptor
  type 3 (ACKR3), protein kinase C (PKC), adenylate cyclase (AC), adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic
  monophosphate (cAMP), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), diacylglycerol (DAG), inositol-(1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3),
  phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3), phospholipase C (PLC), mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR), endoplasmic reticulum (ER)'
