caption: Transcript–metabolite correlation network demonstrating correlations between
  DIMs and DEGs resulting from varietal differences. (A) DEGs related to cysteine
  and methionine metabolism. (B) Correlation network between DIMs and DEGs in cysteine
  and methionine metabolism. (C) DEGs related to glutathione metabolism. (D) Correlation
  network between DIMs and DEGs in the glutathione metabolism pathway. (E) DEGs related
  to amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. (F) Correlation network between
  DIMs and DEGs in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism
