figure_title: Day 24 SMA iHeps show dysregulation of genes implicated in gluconeogenesis
  and drug metabolism and critical proteins involved in mitochondrial electron transport
  chain and fatty acid oxidation
caption: (A) RT-qPCR of gluconeogenesis pathway genes. For PCK2, one outlier from
  SMA1 was removed using the ROUT test with a maximum FDR of 1%. For G6Pase, one outlier
  from SMA3 and SMA1 was removed. (B) RT-qPCR of iHep function genes. (C) RT-qPCR
  of drug metabolism genes. For FMO1, one outlier from SMA1 was removed. In A–C, for
  all RT-qPCR, fold change results were derived using the comparative ΔΔCt method.
  (D) Flow cytometric analysis of critical proteins involved in mitochondrial electron
  transport chain (SDHB and MT-CO1) and fatty acid oxidation (HADHA), with correlation
  to SMN protein expression in day 24 SMA iHeps. MFI readings were obtained through
  the recording of 10,000 events followed by gating of the viable iHeps. In A–D, unless
  specifically indicated that outliers were removed, analysis of data from 3 independent
  experiments included 9 samples (n = 9) each for WT, SMA3, and SMA1 conditions. Similarly
  for analysis of data from 4 independent experiments, n = 12 for each condition.
  Data are presented as mean ± SD and were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  multiple-comparison test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001
