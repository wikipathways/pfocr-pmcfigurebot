caption: Validation of the results using the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway inhibitor
  amygdalin and activator SRI-011381 hydrochloride. (A) In the LV-ETV4 group, the
  expression levels of E-cadherin were decreased, whereas those of N-cadherin and
  Vimentin were increased compared with those in the CON335 group. In the LV-ETV4
  + amygdalin group, E-cadherin expression was increased, whereas N-cadherin and Vimentin
  expression was decreased compared with those in the LV-ETV4 group. In the LV-ETV4-RNAi
  group, E-cadherin expression was increased, whereas N-cadherin and Vimentin expression
  was decreased compared with those in the CON313 group. In the LV-ETV4-RNAi + SRI-
  011381 group, E-cadherin expression was decreased, while N-cadherin and Vimentin
  expression was increased compared with those in the LV-ETV4-RNAi group. (B) In LV-ETV4
  group, the expression of TGF-β1 and Smad4 was increased, while the expression of
  Smad7 was decreased compared with those in the CON335 group. In the LV-ETV4 + amygdalin
  group, the expression of TGF-β1 and Smad4 was decreased, while the expression of
  Smad7 was increased compared with those in the LV-ETV4 group. In the LV-ETV4-RNAi
  group, the expression of TGF-β1 and Smad4 was decreased, while the expression of
  Smad7 was increased compared with those in the CON313 group. In the LV-ETV4-RNAi
  + SRI-011381 group, the expression of TGF-β1 and Smad4 was increased, while the
  expression of Smad7 was decreased compared with those in the LV-ETV4-RNAi group.
