figure_title: Purine catabolic metabolites activate the cAMP pathway to suppress T-cell
  activation by inhibiting glycolytic processes.
caption: Purine catabolic metabolites activate the cAMP pathway to suppress T-cell
  activation by inhibiting glycolytic processes. (A) Percentages of CD25+, CD69+,
  and CD154+ cells among activated CD4+ T cells in the control group (Ctrl), inosine-treated
  group (INO), and A2AR inhibitor-treated group (antiA2AR). (B) Percentages of CD25+,
  CD69+, and CD154+ cells among activated CD4+ T cells in the Ctrl group, iMCreg-treated
  group (MCreg) and anti-A2AR (A2AR inhibitor) group. (C) Pathway analyses indicating
  the activation of the cAMP signaling pathway in the INO group. (D) Comparison of
  the cAMP concentration in the cell supernatant between the Ctrl group and INO group.
  (E) Pathway analysis indicating the inhibition of glycolysis in the INO group. (F)
  Assessment of the differences in the transcript expression levels of HK2 and PKM2
  between the Ctrl group and INO group. (G) Protein expression analysis of HK2 and
  PKM2 in the Ctrl group and INO group. (H) ECAR of T cells in the NA group, Ctrl
  group, and INO group. (I) Glycolytic capacity, glycolytic ability, and glycolytic
  reserve among the three groups. (J) Concentrations of cytokines released into the
  cell supernatants. (K) Inosine triggers the cAMP signaling pathway via the A2AR
  receptor, resulting in the inhibition of glycolytic processes and downstream effector
  functions in T cells
