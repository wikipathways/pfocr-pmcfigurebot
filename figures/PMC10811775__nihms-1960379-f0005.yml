figure_title: Validation of ‘female bone candidates’ in human patient samples.
caption: Validation of ‘female bone candidates’ in human patient samples. (A) Overlapping
  of differential genes in human datasets with Esr1-correlated genes in BXD mice and
  the corresponding pathways. The number of differential genes from each microarray
  study were compared with the number of Esr1-correlated genes (p < 0.01). Similarly,
  pathways obtained through the enrichment analysis of these genes were compared.
  The similarity between the human and mice gene-sets for the overlap of genes and
  pathways was statistically tested using Jaccard similarity coefficient. Expression
  of 25 candidate genes and the TFs that regulate them in (B) human mesenchymal stem
  cells isolated from elderly osteoporosis patients or non-osteoporotic donors (GSE35958)
  and (C) primary osteoblasts obtained from women with osteoporotic fracture or severe
  osteoarthritis (GSE156508). Genes with asterisk in the heatmap are significantly
  different (p < 0.05) between patient and control samples. The PCA plots show the
  clustering of patient and control samples based on the expression profile of the
  genes represented in the heatmap
