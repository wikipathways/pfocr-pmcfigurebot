  (KEGG) analyses of interacting proteins. (A) The details related to the top five
  terms in the ‘Biological Process’, ‘Cellular Component’, and ‘Molecular Function’
  categories found for the interacting proteins in the GO analysis are presented.
  (B) The biological pathways in which the interacting genes (proteins) are mapped
  onto the top 15 positions within a specifically defined pathway
