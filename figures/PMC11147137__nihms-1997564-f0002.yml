caption: Maternal postpartum week 1 metabolome and vitamin D standard dose vs high-dose.
  (A) OPLS discriminant analysis score plot where separation between the 2 intervention
  groups is maximized along the predictive component (x-axis), while the orthogonal
  component accounts for intragroup variability (y-axis). Ellipses indicate the 95%
  confidence region for each intervention group. (B) Logistic regression models summarized
  in a volcano plot. Each dot represents a metabolite; different colors indicate metabolic
  super-pathways in which metabolites are involved. The x-axis indicates change in
  metabolite level (per SD) between the groups, while the y-axis indicates association
  strength in terms of −log10 of P value. No metabolite showed association at FDR
  5% threshold. VitD, Vitamin D
