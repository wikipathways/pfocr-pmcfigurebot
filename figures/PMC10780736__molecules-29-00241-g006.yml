caption: |-
  APS inhibits the activation of the TIGIT/CD155 signaling pathway in colitis mice. (A) Expression of CD155, CD113 and CD112 in colonic tissues was analyzed with Western blotting, and GAPDH was used as a reference for the whole protein. (B–D) Quantitative evaluation of CD155, CD113 and CD112 using Image J to determine spectral band strength. (E,F) Expression of CD155 and TIGIT in colonic tissue was analyzed with RT-PCR with GAPDH as an internal reference gene. (G) Immunofluorescence staining with CD155 (red) and DAPI (blue), red arrows indicate TIGIT-positive cells. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 4). Significantly different compared to the Ctrl group (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). Significantly different compared to the DSS group (#
  p < 0.05, ##
  p < 0.01)
