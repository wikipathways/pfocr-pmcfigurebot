caption: Visualization of CAC-related genes and their functional cross-talks. Colored
  lines between the genes indicate several types of interacting evidence. Orange—physical
  interaction; periwinkle—co-expression; sky blue—involvement in pathways; green-genetic
  interaction; blue color—localization
