figure_title: Acceleration within PREs widely affects the Notch signaling pathway
caption: (A) Tree of life of the whole genome alignment dataset with branches accelerated
  in PREs that are associated with Notch signaling highlighted in orange. Of the 100
  internal branches tested, only 11 (light blue) showed no acceleration in PREs associated
  with Notch signaling genes. Clade block colors as in Fig. 1. (B) The core Notch
  signaling pathway according to the KEGG database [Kanehisa et al. 2016] with proteins
  highlighted according to the amount of acceleration observed in their associated
  PREs. Of the 47 core Notch signaling genes for which we had data, 45 showed acceleration
  within their PREs and 43 showed acceleration in more than branch. Numbers behind
  gene names show the number of branches on which PREs contacting the gene were accelerated
