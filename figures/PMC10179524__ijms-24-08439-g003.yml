figure_title: Clustering, gene ontology, and KEGG analysis of the differentially expressed
  genes.
caption: Clustering, gene ontology, and KEGG analysis of the differentially expressed
  genes. (a) Heatmap showing the five main clusters identified by a hierarchical clustering
  of DEGs. The expression level of each DEG is represented as normalized z-score.
  (b) Gene ontology (GO) analysis of DEGs in five clusters. Y-axis indicates the enriched
  GO terms in the biological process. Dot colors and size represent p-values from
  Fisher’s exact test proportional to the number of DEGs in the given GO terms. (c)
  KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs in five clusters. Y-axis indicates the enriched KEGG
  pathways. Dot colors and size represent p-values from Fisher’s exact test proportional
  to the number of DEGs in the given GO terms
