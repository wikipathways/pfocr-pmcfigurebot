figure_title: Framework of mapping the multiscale functional effects of somatic mutations
caption: (a) Preprocessed TCGA pan-cancer mutation dataset. (b) Overview of the Human
  Protein Structurome. For 3D structures of single proteins, in addition to the 20,431
  canonical isoforms illustrated, the Human Protein Structurome also incorporates
  165,328 non-canonical isoforms. (c) The first part of NetFlow3D, a 3D clustering
  algorithm for identifying both intra- and inter-protein 3D clusters of in-frame
  mutations. (d) The second part of NetFlow3D, a network propagation model for interpreting
  the pathway-scale effects of mutations in 3D clusters by identifying interconnected
  modules
