figure_title: The ubiquitin–proteasome degradation pathway of proteins.
caption: The ubiquitin–proteasome degradation pathway of proteins. E1, E2, and E3
  groups are activated sequentially. E2 and E3 form a complex to bind the substrate
  protein and ubiquitinate it, which is degraded by the proteasome into small molecule
  peptide chains; this process can be reversed by DUB
