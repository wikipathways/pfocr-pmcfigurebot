caption: 'Immune dysfunction induced by pGSN. A chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell-derived
  exosomal pGSN causes CD8+ T cells to undergo apoptosis via caspase-3 activation.
  Apoptosis is not induced in CD4+ T cells by pGSN. CD4+ T cells secreted more IL-4,
  polarized to type 2 helper cells. IFNγ activates the IFNGR1/JAK/STAT1 pathway, decreasing
  the intracellular GSH levels. pGSN depletes CD8+ T cells and reduces IFNγ secretion.
  Thus, GSH production in ovarian cancer was increased and contributes to chemoresistance.
  Exosomal pGSN induces caspase-3 activation and apoptosis of M1 macrophages, which
  leads to decreased iNOS secretion. Furthermore, pGSN increases GSH content in ovarian
  cancer cells via decreased iNOS production in M1 macrophages, contributing to chemotherapy
  resistance. Abbreviations: pGSN, plasma gelsolin; IL-4, interleukin 4; IFNγ, Interferon
  gamma; IFNGR1, interferon gamma receptor 1; JAK, janus kinase; STAT1, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 1; GSH, glutathione; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide
  synthase. Figure designed using BioRender.'
