caption: 'Impact of key metabolites in the gene expression and metabolic profiles
  of two GBM cell lines: U251 and U-87MG. The uptake of glucose occurs through the
  GLUT1 transporter. Hexokinase 2 (HKII) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the
  glycolytic pathway. Glucose-6-phosphate can be diverted to the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) through glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), contributing to
  nucleotide synthesis. Glycolysis-derived pyruvate can be converted into lactate,
  which can be exported and imported by the monocarboxylate transporters MCT4 and
  MCT1, respectively. Pyruvate oxidation catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA)
  creates acetyl-CoA, which can enter the TCA cycle. Acetyl-CoA can also be derived
  from ketone body oxidation, which occurs through 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (SCOT)
  and acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1). Acetyl-CoA is also a product of fatty
  acid β-oxidation, where ACADS and ACADM are involved in the breakdown of small-
  and medium-chain fatty acids, respectively. Acetyl-CoA can be deviated to supply
  fatty acid synthesis, which occurs through fatty acid synthase (FAS), contributing
  to phospholipid synthesis. Glutamine is transported through LAT1, SNAT1, SNAT2,
  and SNAT3, and is hydrolyzed by glutaminase (GLS) into glutamate, generating nitrogen,
  which is then used for amino acid, purine, and pyrimidine synthesis. Glutamate can
  also be imported through GLT-1 and GLAST, then being converted into α-ketoglutarate,
  entering the TCA cycle, or into glutamine, through glutamine synthase (GLNS). Glutamine-derived
  α-ketoglutarate entering the TCA cycle and contributing to fatty acid metabolism
  reinforces the importance of glutamine, which is not only used for biomass production,
  but also for energetic purposes. Glutamine-derived glutamate is used as a nitrogen
  source in the synthesis of serine from glucose-derived 3-phosphoglycerate. Serine
  can be converted into glycine, supplying one-carbon metabolism (folate and methionine
  cycle), from which cysteine is synthesized through the transsulfuration pathway.
  Glutamate and cystine, alongside glycine, constitute the three components of glutathione,
  the cell’s most important reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger and detoxifying
  agent. Arrows mean decrease (↓), and increase (↑). Unknown or uncertain course is
  (?) signed.'
