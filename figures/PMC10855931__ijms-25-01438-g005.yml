figure_title: RNA-seq for potential target of TonEBP.
caption: RNA-seq for potential target of TonEBP. (A) Volcano plot of DEGs between
  the sh-NC group and sh-TonEBP group. p-value < 0.05 and |(log2FoldChange)| > 1.
  (B) GO enrichment scatter plot. (C) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis plot. (D) GO
  enrichment chord diagram and bar plot legend for GO terms. (E) Wayne diagram showing
  upregulated DEGs in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells and downregulated DEGs in TonEBP-deficient
  BV2 cells. (F,G) Immunohistochemistry (scale bar = 50 μm) (F) and IHC score (G)
  for PELI1 in brain tissues of humans in control group and ICH group. N = 3. The
  data are presented as mean ± SD. ** p < 0.01
