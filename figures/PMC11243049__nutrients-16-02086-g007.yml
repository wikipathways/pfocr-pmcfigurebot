caption: Phosphorylation of (A) positive and (B) negative regulators of the insulin
  signaling pathway measured in L6 myocytes stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 20
  min after being treated for 24 h with MCM derived from RAW264.7 macrophages treated
  with 100 μM total FA for 24 h followed by 10 ng/mL LPS for 12 h. Values are means
  ± SEM; n = 7–8/treatment. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA for the effect of
  FA treatment. Means without a common letter are significantly different, p < 0.05
