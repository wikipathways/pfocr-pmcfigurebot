figure_title: DNA repair pathways of DNA double-strand breaks.
caption: DNA repair pathways of DNA double-strand breaks. The classical nonhomologous
  end-joining (c-NHEJ) pathway, the alternative end-joining pathway (alt-EJ), and
  the homologous recombination (HR) pathway repair DNA double-strand breaks by ligating
  the broken DNA ends (c-NHEJ) using short homologous sequences after resection of
  the damaged DNA (alt-EJ) or reconstituting the original sequence (HR). (a). DNA-PK
  forms a complex with KU70/KU80 to activate DCLRE1C/Artemis and then promote excision/repair
  by XRCC4/LIG4. (b). PARP1 binds to the affected DNA and allows MRN complex to form.
  EXO1, BLM, and RBBP8 causes an extensive end resection which is repaired by POLQ
  and LIG3. (c). HR via ATM and ATR pathways activates BRCA1/2 and promotes recruitment
  of other proteins such as Fanconi proteins (FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, and FANCF) and
  PARP1/2. p = phosphorylation
