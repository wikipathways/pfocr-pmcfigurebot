  and FFcre mice.
caption: Predictive developmental trajectories of iNKT thymocytes in GATA3 FF and
  FFcre mice. (A) Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA) analysis was applied to
  the single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from GATA-3 FF and FFcre iNKT thymocytes.
  The PAGA graph (right panel) and PAGA-initialized single-cell embedding (left panel)
  are presented. Weighted edges in the graph represent a statistical measure of connectivity
  between clusters. (B) Pseudo-time analysis was conducted to delineate the developmental
  trajectory of iNKT cells, with piNKT0 serving as the Root point. (C) The expression
  patterns of a representative list of cell-subset-specific gene markers are depicted.
  (D) Visualization of selected markers of PAGA-initialized single-cell embedding
  alongside the trajectories defined in (A). (E) The percentage of cell subsets in
  FF and FFcre mice is illustrated, with deduced developmental pathways indicated
  by arrows
