caption: Time-dependent response of OsBOR1 to B-deficiency in rice roots. A–D, Localization
  of OsBOR1 at 0 (A), 1 (B), 3 (C), and 5 (D) days after B-deficiency. E, Signal intensity
  of OsBOR1. Seedlings (25-d-old) were precultured in a solution containing 30 µM
  B for 3 d and then transferred to a solution free of B for 0, 1, 3, and 5 d. Mature
  region (15 mm) of crown roots were sampled for immunostaining of OsBOR1. Red color
  shows signal from OsBOR1. Signals were merged with bright field. Scale bars = 50 µm.
  All pictures were taken under the same conditions. The signal intensities of OsBOR1
  were quantified by LAS AF Lite software. Data are means ± sd (n = 10–15). Different
  letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05 by Tukey–Kramer’s test.
