caption: Comparison of three indicators of the four methods for the analysis of glioblastoma
  multiforme (GBM). (a) The four methods obtain different accuracies of the pathways
  under different k values. (b) The four methods obtain different coverage of the
  pathways under different k values. (c) The four methods obtain different mutual
  exclusion of the pathways under different k values
