figure_title: Comparison of DEGs between PR and SD/PD groups based on OP samples.
caption: Comparison of DEGs between PR and SD/PD groups based on OP samples. Blue
  indicates PR, and red indicates SD/PD. (A) A heatmap of DEGs. (B) A bar plot of
  GSEA log-scale p-values for DEGs. (C) Venn diagrams of (1) DEGs upregulated at BL
  (vs. at OP) and DEGs upregulated in the SD/PD group (vs. the PR group) based on
  OP samples. Cell cycle pathway genes denoted among the overlapping genes; (2) DEGs
  upregulated at BL and DEGs upregulated in the PR group. (D) Survival plots and gene
  expression boxplots for ATR and CDK4. Log-rank analysis was performed for high and
  low gene expression groups in OP samples. BL, baseline; DEGs, differentially expressed
  genes; GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis; OP, operation; PD, progressive disease;
  PR, partial response; SD, stable disease
