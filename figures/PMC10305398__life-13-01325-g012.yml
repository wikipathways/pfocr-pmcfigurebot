figure_title: Metabolic pathways of Caco-2 and Hep-G2 cells positively affected by
  the proposed compounds in the presence or absence of Nori.
caption: Metabolic pathways of Caco-2 and Hep-G2 cells positively affected by the
  proposed compounds in the presence or absence of Nori. Obtained using MetaboAnalyst
  5.0 pathway enrichment analysis of significantly different metabolites between groups
  (p < 0.05). The enrichment rate is calculated as the number of hits between a particular
  metabolic pathway divided by the expected number of hits
