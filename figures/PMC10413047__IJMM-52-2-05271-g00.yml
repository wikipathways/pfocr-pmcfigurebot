caption: Mechanisms of lncRNAs in nucleus and cytoplasm. In the nucleus, ① lncRNAs
  regulate chromatin or act as scaffolds to recruit multiple regulatory molecules
  to gene promoters to activate or suppress gene expression, ② regulate messenger
  RNA processing by recruiting regulatory molecules to messenger RNA, ③ and bind to
  numerous chromatin remodelers and regulated histones, thereby promoting or suppressing
  gene expression, or modifying DNA to suppress gene expression. In cytoplasm, ④ lncRNAs
  regulate mRNA stability by directly binding to mRNA to form RNA-RNA duplexes, ⑤
  interact with proteins to regulate signaling cascades and subsequent changes in
  gene expression, ⑥ and act as miRNA sponges to competitively bind miRNA regulation,
  which in turn has an impact on ⑦ signaling pathways. lncRNA, long non-coding RNA;
  miR, microRNA
