figure_title: Pin1 inhibits the AMPK/ACC1 pathway in hepatocytes under metabolic stimulation.
caption: 'Pin1 inhibits the AMPK/ACC1 pathway in hepatocytes under metabolic stimulation.
  (A,B) Overexpression and knockdown of Pin1 in HepG2 and L-02 cells after the addition
  of the AMPK pathway inhibitor Compound C to validate AMPK/ACC1 signalling pathway
  protein expression and quantitative statistical plots, respectively. (* indicates
  p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01; ## indicates p < 0.01). Note: In the statistical
  graph of overexpressed cells, A indicates the pBybe-OA group, B indicates the Pin1-OA
  group, C indicates the pBybe-OA + CC group, and D indicates the Pin1-OA + CC group.
  In the statistical graph of knockdown cells, A indicates the pLKO.1-OA group, B
  indicates the shPin1-OA group, C indicates the pLKO.1-OA + CC group, and D indicates
  the shPin1-OA + CC group'
