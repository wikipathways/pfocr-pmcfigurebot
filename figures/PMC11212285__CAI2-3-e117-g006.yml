caption: Mitogen‐activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) silencing inhibits the proliferarion
  of endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were transiently
  transfected with MAPK4 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (50 nM) in 24‐well plates via
  Lipofectamine 3000 reagent in vitro, 48 h later. (a) The expression of MAPK4 was
  analyzed by real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). (b) Western blot analysis
  and (c) immunofluorescence staining were used to detect and quantitatively analyze
  MAPK4 expression in the two groups. (d, e) Cell counting kit‐8 (CCK‐8) assay was
  used to evaluate the proliferation of HUVECs 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection
  of MAPK4‐RNA interference (RNAi). (f) Colony formation assay was used to evaluate
  the colony‐forming ability of HUVECs and the colonies were counted. (g) The tube‐forming
  ability of HUVECs was evaluated by tube formation assay. (h) The cell cycle distribution
  was evaluated by fluorescence‐activated cell sorting. (i) The expression levels
  of CDKs in HUVECs were determined by real‐time PCR. (j) Western blot analysis was
  used to evaluate the expression of Cyclin A, Cyclin B1, and cyclin‐dependent kinase
  inhibitor 1A (p21) in HUVECs. Representative data from three independent experiments
  were shown. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. NS, no significance.
