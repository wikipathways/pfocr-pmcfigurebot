caption: SIK1 can regulate the downstream target genes of the TGF-β pathway and EMT.
  (A, B) The protein expression of SW480 and RKO cells after transfection with SIK1
  by western blot. (C) The protein expression of SIK1 knockdown on the TGF-β pathway
  and EMT by western blot. (D) Co-IP experiments were performed using either an anti-SIK1
  antibody to pull down Smad7 or an anti-Smad7 antibody to pull down SIK1 in HCT116
  cells to identify an interaction between SIK1 and Smad7. (E) Western blot analyses
  were performed for E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, PAI-1, FN, SMAD2, pSMAD2, and
  SIK1 in the indicated cells between SIK1 knockdown and SIK1 knockdown with the TGF-β
  pathway inhibitor LY2157299 (Gal). Statistical analysis was performed in triplicate
  experiments via unpaired Student's t test. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (n=3),
  n.s. p>=0.05, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, *** p<0.001
