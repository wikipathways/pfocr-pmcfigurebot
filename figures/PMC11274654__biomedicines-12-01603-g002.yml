caption: MTZ stimulates the Wnt signaling pathway in osteoblasts. (A) Exposing C3H10T1/2
  cells to MTZ for 21 days in the differentiation medium significantly increased mineralized
  nodules compared to the vehicle, as assessed by Alizarin Red S staining. Left panel
  shows representative Alizarin S dye-stained nodules and right panel shows the quantified
  data after dye extraction by CPC. (B) Exposing C3H10T1/2 cells to MTZ (10 nM) increased
  Runx2 expression. Left panel shows the representative blots and right panel showing
  the quantification of Runx2 expression from 3 independent experiments. (C) TOP-Flash
  reporter assay to evaluate the Wnt transactivation by MTZ. (D) Exposing RCO to MTZ
  (10 nM) showed an early increase in p-GSK levels. Top panel shows the representative
  blots and bottom panel shows the quantification of p-GSK and GSK expression from
  3 independent experiments. (E) Exposing RCO to MTZ (10 nM) increased β-catenin nuclear
  translocation. Wnt3a was used as a positive control. Top panel shows the representative
  images and bottom panel shows the quantification of the data. All values are expressed
  as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 compared to
  the vehicle (water) or as indicated
