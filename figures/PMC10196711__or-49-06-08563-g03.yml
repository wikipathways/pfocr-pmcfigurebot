caption: 'NPM1 silencing inhibits lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth by restraining
  the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway. (A) Nude mice and tumors. (B) Tumor weight. (C)
  Tumor volume. (D) The expression of p-EGFR/EGFR, p-MEK/MEK and p-ERK/ERK was determined
  using western blotting. Non-transfected or sh-NPM1/sh-NC-transfected A549 cells
  (5×106 cells/100 µl) were injected subcutaneously into mice. ##P<0.01 vs. model
  + sh-NC. NPM1, nucleophosmin; p-, phosphorylated; sh-, short hairpin; NC, negative
  control'
