caption: miR-100-5pmiR-100-5p inactivates the mTOR signaling pathway through downregulation
  of Trib2 expression during myoblast differentiation. (A,B) Effect of miR-100-5p
  inhibition on the protein expression of phosphor-mTOR (p-mTOR) and phosphor-S6K
  (p-S6K) during myoblast differentiation. (C,D) Effects of miR-100-5p overexpression
  and Trib2 knockdown on the protein expression of phosphor-mTOR (p-mTOR) and phosphor-S6K
  (p-S6K) during myoblast differentiation. (E,F) miR-100-5p inhibitor and Trib2 siRNA
  were co-transfected into myoblasts. Western-blot-detected the protein expression
  of TRIB2, phosphor-mTOR (p-mTOR), phosphor-S6K (p-S6K), and differentiation-related
  genes (MyoG and MyHC). (G,H) Western-blot-detected the protein expression of phosphor-mTOR
  (p-mTOR), phosphor-S6K (p-S6K), TRIB2, and differentiation-related genes (MyoG and
  MyHC) in differentiated myoblasts that were treated with mTOR-pathway-specific inhibitors
  (Rapamycin) and the corresponding control group treated with dimethyl sulfoxide
  (DMSO). The results are presented as the mean Â± SEM (n = 3). * p < 0.05; ** p <
  0.01
