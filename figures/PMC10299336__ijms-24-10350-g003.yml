figure_title: Association between NFE2L2 expression and MAPK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  oncogenic signalling in T-ALL.
caption: Association between NFE2L2 expression and MAPK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR oncogenic
  signalling in T-ALL. (A,B) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed in
  38 T-ALL patients with publicly available gene expression data [32] based on their
  NFE2L2 expression levels as a continuous variable. (A) Two representative signatures
  for MAPK-ERK signalling pathway were selected from the Molecular Signatures Dabatase
  (MSigDB), and their systematic names are M27565 (REACTOME_MAPK_FAMILY_SIGNALING_CASCADES)
  and M13863 (BIOCARTA_MAPK_PATHWAY). (B) Two representative signatures for PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  signalling pathway were selected from the Molecular Signatures Dabatase (MSigDB),
  and their systematic names are M5923 (HALLMARK_PI3K_AKT_MTOR_SIGNALING) and M16909
  (PARENT_MTOR_SIGNALING_UP). The green curve corresponds to the enrichment score
  (ES) curve, which is the running sum of the weighted score obtained with the GSEA
  software v4.2.1. NES, normalized enrichment score; NOM-p, nominal p value. (C–F)
  Violin or scatter plots representing NFE2L2 expression (DESeq2 normalized counts)
  in 249 patients from the TARGET cohort without (No mut) or with (Mut) mutations
  in KRAS, PTEN or TP53. Mann–Whitney test was used to determine the p-value. (G)
  GSEA was performed in 249 T-ALL patients from the TARGET cohort with available data
  from whole exome sequencing, comparing those with and without mutations in PTEN
  (PTEN_Mut vs. PTEN_No mut) as discrete phenotypes. These signatures were selected
  from the Molecular Signatures Dabatase (MSigDB), and their systematic names are
  M45021 (REACTOME_KEAP1_NFE2L2_PATHWAY) and M45026 (REACTOME_NUCLEAR_EVENTS_MEDIATED_BY_NFE2L2).
  The green curve corresponds to the enrichment score (ES) curve, which is the running
  sum of the weighted score obtained with the GSEA software v4.2.1. NES, normalized
  enrichment score; NOM-p, nominal p value
