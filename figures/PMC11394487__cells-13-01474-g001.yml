  = −2.
caption: 'The tumor microenvironment pathway is predicted to be altered (z-score =
  −2.77) and closely associated [−log(p-value) = 8.83] with breast cancer. Description:
  AKT activates NFκB and SLC2 and inhibits BAD and FOXO via phosphorylation, where
  BAD and FOXO induce the apoptosis of tumor cells. ARG1 contributes to CD8 T-cell
  immunity; BCL2 promotes the survival of tumor cells; CCL2, CSF1, CSF2, and CSF3
  enhance myeloid-derived suppressor cell accumulation and the proliferation of tumor-associated
  macrophages; CCND1 stimulates the proliferation of tumor cells; CD274 is responsible
  for the adaptive immune response of CD8+ T cells; CTL promotes apoptosis; and PD-1
  is involved in the PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy pathway. CXCL12, CFCL8, FGF, MMP9,
  OSM, and VEGF are causative for angiogenesis. STAT3 regulates the expression of
  BCL2, CCND1, CD274, FAS, HIF1A, MMP2, MYC, PTGS2, SPP1, and VEGF, whereas NFκB regulates
  the expression of AP1, BCL2, CD274, CFLAR, and PLAU, which are responsible for tumor
  cell proliferation, viability, angiogenesis, and metastasis'
