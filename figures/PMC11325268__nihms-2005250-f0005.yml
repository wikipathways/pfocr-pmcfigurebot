figure_title: Identification of a p53-dependent TIRR-specific transcriptomic signature
  with the potential to serve as a prognostic tool
caption: (A) GSEA of mouse PGAT samples (TIRRKO vs. TIRRWT, NES = −1.925, p < 0.001,
  FDR = 0.010) and p53HET LUAD samples of patients with high TIRR (n = 30) against
  low TIRR (n = 30) expression showing significant suppression of the cholesterol
  biosynthesis pathway in low-TIRR samples (NES = −1.819, p = 0.004, FDR = 0.017).(B)
  GSEA overlap for cholesterol biosynthesis pathway from LUAD samples with high (above
  median) and low (below median) TIRR expression of p53HET (NES = −1.819, p = 0.004,
  FDR = 0.017) and p53KO (NES = 1.420, p = −0.074, FDR = 0.112) samples.(C) ChIP-PCR
  revealed significant regulation of Abca1 and Sqle promoters by p53 in the absence
  of TIRR in MEFs.(D) Relative gene expression levels of TNF-α, ABCA1, and Dhcr24
  in MEFs treated with siABCA1.(E) Log2 fold change (Log2FC) for p53-dependent TIRRKO
  signature derived from MEFs (TIRRfl/fl, TIRRKO, and p53KO;TIRRKO).(F) p53-dependent
  TIRR signature score and TIRR expression (log2 value + 1) significantly correlate
  in cancer tissue of patients with primary p53HET LUAD (Pearson R = 0.34, p = 0.007).
  Depicted means are SEM, * p < 0.05 and **** p < 0.0001
