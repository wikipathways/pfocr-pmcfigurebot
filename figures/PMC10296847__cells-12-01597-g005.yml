caption: 'TREM2 depletion modulates neuroinflammatory pathways in response to tau
  pathology: (A) “Four-way” plot comparing differential expression analyses from the
  NanoString neuroinflammation data in the ipsilateral brain. Each point represents
  one gene. The x-axis shows Log2 fold changes in Trem2−/− compared with that in WT
  controls in PBS-injected mice, and the y-axis compares Trem2−/− vs. WT controls
  in AD-tau-injected mice. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a p < 0.05 and
  log2 fold change > ±0.58 from the x-axis comparison are shown in green, the DEGs
  from the y-axis comparison are shown in pink, and the DEGs in both comparisons are
  shown in blue. Gray dots represent genes that were not significantly differentially
  expressed. (B) Comparisons of pathway annotation scores from the NanoString neuroinflammation
  panel. Microglial function scores and inflammatory signaling differed between WT
  and Trem2−/− mice injected with AD-tau (highlighted in red). n = 6 per group'
