caption: 'The mRNA expression levels of IGFBP2 (A) and the representative DEGs (B)
  in the cytokine−cytokine receptor pathway in goose primary hepatocytes transfected
  with IGFBP2 siRNA (siIGFBP2) vs. the negative control siRNA (siNC). The mRNA expression
  of the genes of interest was determined by qPCR. Note: 10% serum medium includes
  glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 10% serum; 2% serum medium includes glucose-free
  DMEM supplemented with 2% serum. * denotes p < 0.05 for the Medium1 siNC vs. Medium2
  siNC, or the Medium2 siNC vs. Medium2 siIGFBP2. n = 6. The internal reference gene
  was β-actin and all data are presented as the mean ± SEM'
