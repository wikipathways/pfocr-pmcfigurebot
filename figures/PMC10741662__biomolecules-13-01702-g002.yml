caption: The WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway affects cell behavior in the proliferative
  phase of wound healing. WNT/β-catenin signaling can affect wound healing by regulating
  the cellular behavior of KCs, HFSCs, and fibroblasts. WNT signaling promotes KC
  migration by degrading E-cadherin on the surface of KCs. WNT signaling can also
  prevent β-catenin degradation in the cytoplasm. Based on the above, WNT signaling
  promotes KC proliferation and differentiation. In addition, WNT signaling induces
  self-renewal and proliferation of HFSCs, and WNT signaling can induce HFSCs to differentiate
  into epidermal cells, DP/DS cells, and fibroblasts, thereby promoting wound repair.
  The WNT/β-catenin pathway can also recruit HFSCs and fill SGs. SG cells and HFSCs
  could further differentiate into sebaceous cells. Finally, β-catenin promotes fibroblasts
  to produce ECM, which is required for wound closure and KC migration. β-catenin
  also plays a key role in fibroblast proliferation and migration
