caption: 'Metabolic pathway enrichment map: the horizontal coordinate is the enrichment
  significance p-value and the vertical coordinate is the KEGG pathway. Displayed
  are the 25 most important enzymatic pathways differentiating between groups, with
  colored side bar displaying the relative metabolite concentration in each group.
  Data analyzed between groups after calculating T2/T1 (post/pre). The first nine
  pathways listed had significant predicted changes (p < 0.05)'
