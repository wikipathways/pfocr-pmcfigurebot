caption: Therapeutic effects of L. acidophilus in SS. L. acidophilus was administered
  orally to NOD mice, which were monitored for 24 weeks. Salivary glands and the spleen
  were harvested. A Saliva flow rate at 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks. B Salivary glands
  were stained with H&E. The histological score (left) and inflammation area (right)
  are shown. C Salivary gland tissues were stained for IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α. Numbers
  of cells positive for IL-6 (left), IL-17 (center), and TNF-α (right) are shown.
  D Splenocytes (top) and salivary glands (bottom) analyzed by flow cytometry for
  percentages of Th1 (CD4+IFN-γ+), Th2 (CD4+IL-4+), Th17 (CD4+IL-17+), and B17 (CD19+IL-17+)
  cells. E Salivary glands were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Representative images
  of Th17 (CD4+IL-17+; top) and Treg (CD4+CD25+FOXP3.+; bottom) cells are shown. Bar
  graphs show the numbers of cells positive for Th17 and Treg. Data are means ± SD
