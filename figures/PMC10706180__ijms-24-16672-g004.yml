caption: SOX18 enhances the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway in DPCs. (a) KEGG enrichment analysis
  of DEGs obtained after SOX18 knockdown. (b) DEGs in the siR-SOX18 and siR-NC related
  to the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway are depicted as a heatmap. The red box indicates upregulation,
  and the blue box indicates downregulation. (c,d) TOP/FOP-flash assays following
  overexpression or knockdown of SOX18 in DPCs, respectively. (e,f) Detection of mRNA
  level of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related genes following overexpression or knockdown
  of SOX18 in DPCs, respectively. (g,h) Detection of the protein expression of β-Catenin
  following overexpression or knockdown of SOX18 in DPCs, respectively. The data are
  presented as means ± SEM (standard error of the mean) (n = 3). The statistical significance
  was assessed using the unpaired Student’s t-test. (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ***
  p < 0.001)
