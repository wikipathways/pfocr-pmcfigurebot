caption: GSEA analysis and the identification of nine core pathways. (A,B) represent
  pathways that are significantly up-regulated or down-regulated when AFB1 was exposed
  to the 3 cell lines based on GSEA analysis. (C) GSEA analysis showed that AFB1 exposure
  significantly up-regulated apoptosis-related pathways. (D) Interaction between 9
  core pathways and genes
