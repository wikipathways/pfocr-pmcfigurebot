figure_title: Metabolic analysis results of LD muscle in DDBJ and JXB pigs (a) Grouping
  principal component analysis; PC1 represents the first principal component, PC2
  represents the second principal component, and the percentage represents the interpretation
  rate of the principal component to the dataset; each point in the figure represents
  a sample, samples of the same group are indicated by the same color, and “Group”
  is a group.
caption: Metabolic analysis results of LD muscle in DDBJ and JXB pigs (a) Grouping
  principal component analysis; PC1 represents the first principal component, PC2
  represents the second principal component, and the percentage represents the interpretation
  rate of the principal component to the dataset; each point in the figure represents
  a sample, samples of the same group are indicated by the same color, and “Group”
  is a group. (b) Differential metabolite scatter diagram, where each point represents
  a metabolite, and different colors represent distinct classifications. The abscissa
  denotes the logarithm (log2FC) of the relative content difference multiple of a
  substance in two sample groups. The size of the dot signifies the VIP value. (c)
  For the overall change analysis of the KEGG metabolic pathway, the ordinate represents
  the name of different pathways (sorted by p-values), and the abscissa indicates
  the DA score. The DA Score is the sum of all metabolite alterations throughout the
  metabolic pathway. An expression score of 1 shows an upregulation trend in the expression
  of all metabolites in this pathway, and a score of −1 signifies a downregulation
  trend in the expression of all of the detected metabolites within this pathway (d)
  Metabolite sets enrichment analysis; the ordinate highlights the name of the metabolic
  set (sorted by p-values), corresponding to the p-value of the metabolic set; the
  abscissa indicates fold enrichment
