caption: 'Immunoscape and immunologic properties of G protein-coupled receptors. A:
  Immunoscore, ESTIMATE score and stromal score were applied to determine the different
  immune status between the high and low risk groups; B: The activity of immune-related
  pathways was significantly different between the high risk and the significant differences
  between high and low risk groups. C: Immunotherapy escape status was assessed using
  TIDE in high and low risk groups; D, E: The abundance of infiltrating cell types
  between each risk group was quantified by the CIBESORT algorithm (D) and the ssGSEA
  algorithm (E) between the high and low risk groups. F: Correlation of immune infiltrating
  cells with the GPCRRS gene. G: The expression of immune checkpoints in high- and
  low-risk groups'
