figure_title: Activation of the HPC-mPFC pathway.
caption: Activation of the HPC-mPFC pathway. (A) Representative figure showing chemogenetic
  activation of the HPC-mPFC pathway. (B) Representative images showing expression
  of hM3Dq-mCherry and -mCherry in the HPC. (C) Representative image showing c-Fos
  and mCherry expression in the mPFC. (D) Representative images showing c-Fos expression
  in the mPFC of different groups. (E) Chemogenetic activation of the HPC-mPFC pathway
  increased the number of c-Fos-positive cells in the mPFC of septic mice (LPS+CNO
  vs. LPS, *** P<0.001); Compared with the Ctrl group, the expression of c-Fos is
  significantly lower in LPS group; Compared with the LPS+CNO group, the expressions
  of c-Fos were inhibited in inhibitors (D-AP5, NBQX) group. Data were presented as
  mean Â± SEM. n=5/group. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
