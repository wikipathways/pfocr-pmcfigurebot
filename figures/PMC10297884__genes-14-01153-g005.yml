  pathway of R.
caption: Study on phosphorylated protein and gene levels in ABA signal transduction
  pathway of R. chrysanthum irradiated by UV-B. DEGs are filtered using log2 FPKM
  (transcript fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads). Genes that are downregulated
  or upregulated are indicated by green and red text, respectively. The green and
  yellow boxes represent phosphorylated downregulated and upregulated proteins, respectively
