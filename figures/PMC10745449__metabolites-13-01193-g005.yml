caption: Enriched metabolic pathways of the differential metabolites at different
  altitudes for leaves (a) and roots (b). Each bubble in the plot represents a metabolic
  pathway whose abscissa and bubble size jointly indicate the magnitude of the impact
  factors of the pathway. A larger bubble size indicates a larger impact factor
