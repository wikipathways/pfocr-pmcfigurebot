caption: UPR activation. ROS enters the ER and causes ER stress. ER stress would create
  ROS inside the ER and vice versa. Inflammation induced by ROS increases protein
  synthesis to produce proinflammatory proteins. ER stress releases BiP from the luminal
  domain of the stress sensors (PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6). Once activated, ATF6 and PERK
  stimulate chaperone (BiP, ERp72, and PDI) expression. The chaperones will remove
  proteins, further inducing protein synthesis. The increased protein synthesis causes
  impairment in protein folding and produces misfolded proteins. The misfolded proteins
  create more ER stress and vice versa. The activated PERK phosphorylated eIF2α that
  supports ATF4 translation. ATF4 mediates and, therefore, increases protein synthesis.
  IRE1α activation results in the initiation of IRE1α-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)
  signaling, which activates beclin-1. ATF4 and beclin-1 trigger the autophagy-lysosomal
  pathway, creating autophagosomes, causing autophagy and even cell death. ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BiP, binding immunoglobulin protein;
  PERK, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; IRE1α, inositol-requiring protein; ATF,
  activating transcription factor; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; JNK, JUN N-terminal
  kinase.
