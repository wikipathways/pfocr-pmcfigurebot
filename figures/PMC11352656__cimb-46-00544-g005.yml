figure_title: Effects of heat stress and astaxanthin treatment in the NFE2L2-mediated
  signaling pathway in the thymus tissue of Cobb 500 broilers.
caption: 'Effects of heat stress and astaxanthin treatment in the NFE2L2-mediated
  signaling pathway in the thymus tissue of Cobb 500 broilers. Three groups were compared:
  TN, HS, and HSAX. Dunn post hoc test for pair-wise comparison of statistical significance
  represented the following: (A) NFE2L2, TN vs. HS (p = 0.033); (B) KEAP1, TN vs.
  HS (p = 0.028), TN vs. HSAX (p = 0.028); (C) MAF, TN vs. HS (p = 0.024). * Differences
  between treatments significant at p < 0.05'
