caption: (a) Workflow diagram to identify the upstream regulators and signaling pathways
  involved in COVID-19 and SNCA. Using IPA’s “Grow” tool, we identified molecules
  associated with COVID-19 and SNCA. We then analyzed the overlapping molecules obtained
  from IPA’s “Compare” tool using IPA’s “Core Analysis” tool to identify the upstream
  regulators and signaling pathways. (b) Venn diagram of molecules associated with
  COVID-19 and SNCA identified from the QKB. We employed IPA’s “Compare” tool to identify
  the overlapping molecules associated with COVID-19 and SNCA. We identified 92 overlapping
  molecules between COVID-19 and SNCA and removed 3 molecules that were chemical and
  biological drugs from further analysis
