caption: Pathological Aβ and tau formation in Alzheimer’s disease. (A) Cleavage sites
  for γ-secretase. (B) In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP gets chopped up by α-secretase
  and γ-secretase, which is called the nonamyloidogenic pathway, resulting in extracellular
  products called sAPPα and secreted fragment called P3, which are soluble, and leaves
  the membrane-bound APP intracellular domain (AICD). (C) In the amyloidogenic pathway,
  APP is first cleaved by β-secretase instead followed by the processing by γ-secretase,
  producing the secreted extracellular products called sAPPβ and Aβ40/Aβ42, and the
  same membrane-bound AICD. (D) Microtubules are strong cylindrical polymers that
  provide structural support to neurons. Tau is the major microtubule-associated protein
  in neurons and it stabilizes microtubule architecture. Under pathological conditions,
  tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and detaches from microtubules. Phosphorylated tau
  then aggregates to form paired helical filaments (PHFs) and NFTs.
