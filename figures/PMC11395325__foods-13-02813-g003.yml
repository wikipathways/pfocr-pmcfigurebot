caption: Results of UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS analysis and network pharmacology
  analysis of HAE. (A) The proportional representation of various compound categories
  in HAE. (B) The structure of HQ. (C) The Venn diagram of the intersection between
  HAE flavonoids and lactation. (D) Target classification. (E) PPI network. Targets
  with larger nodes in the network have higher degree values; the thickness of edges
  represents interactions between targets. (F) PPI network clusters. GO (G) and KRGG
  (H) enrichment analysis of the potential functional protein modules after cluster
  analysis using the MCODE plugin. (I) ITP network. The blueâ€“green nodes are potential
  flavonoid components; the yellow nodes are the potential functional protein modules;
  and the red dots are the KEGG signaling pathway. Larger node sizes indicate higher
  degree values. (J) The main targets of HQ. The thickness of edges represents interactions
  between targets. (K) The Venn diagram of the intersection between 125 lactation-related
  DEGs based on RNA-Seq and 30 potential core targets
