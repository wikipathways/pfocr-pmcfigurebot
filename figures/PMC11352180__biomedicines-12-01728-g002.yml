caption: Mechanism of cGAS-STING activation in acute myocardial infarction reperfusion
  injury. During acute myocardial infarction and reperfusion, myocardial cells undergo
  necrosis or apoptosis due to ischemia and oxidative stress, leading to the release
  of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA into the cytosol. This cytosolic DNA is recognized
  and bound by cGAS, which activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, triggering
  a series of downstream signaling events, including the phosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).
  These inflammatory factors induce a robust inflammatory response through autocrine
  or paracrine pathways, further activating and recruiting immune cells such as neutrophils,
  macrophages, and T cells to the damaged area. This persistent inflammation and microcirculatory
  dysfunction ultimately lead to cardiac dysfunction, manifested by myocardial fibrosis,
  left ventricular remodeling, and an increased risk of heart failure
