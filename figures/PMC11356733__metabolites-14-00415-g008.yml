figure_title: Bubble diagram of metabolic pathways of differential metabolites in
  each group.
caption: 'Bubble diagram of metabolic pathways of differential metabolites in each
  group. (a–f) represent the metabolic pathway bubble diagrams for each group, (a)
  HC vs. LC group; (b) HM vs. LM group; (c) HCLM vs. LCLM group; (d) HCHM vs. LCHM
  group; (e) LCHM group vs. LCLM group (f) HCHM vs. LCLM group (1): arginine biosynthesis;
  (2): tricarboxylic acid cycle(TCA); (3): cysteine and methionine metabolism; (4):
  glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; (5): arginine and proline metabolism;
  (6): alanine, aspartic acid, and glutamate metabolism; (7): aminotransferase-tRNA
  biosynthesis; (8): Butyric acid metabolism; (9): glyoxylate and dicarboxylic acid
  metabolism; (10): purine metabolism; (11): glutathione metabolism; (12): glycerophospholipid
  metabolism; (13): D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism; (14): pyruvate metabolism;
  (15): glycolysis/glycohydrogenation; (16): taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. The
  graph’s X-axis represents the pathway influence factor, and the Y-axis shows the
  enrichment analysis’s p-value. The bigger the circle, the more influential it is;
  the darker the circle’s color, the lower the p-value and the more significant the
  enrichment'
