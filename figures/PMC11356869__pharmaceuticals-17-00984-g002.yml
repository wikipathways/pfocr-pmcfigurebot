  Osteoblast proliferation/differentiation occur through the activation of signaling
  pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, MAPK or by inhibiting the NF-kB and RANKL/RANK.
  EAHM compounds (green circles) such as Icariin, Triptolide, Mangiferin, Naringin,
  Curcumin, Quercetin, Ugonin K, Tanshinone IIA, Avicularin and Emodin can alter several
  targets to exhibit anti-osteoporosis effects. Inverted T marks (⊥) denote inhibition
  whereas arrows (↓) indicate the activation (Figure generated by Biorender.com)
