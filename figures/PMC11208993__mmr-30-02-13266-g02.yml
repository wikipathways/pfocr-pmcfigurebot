caption: 'BMSC-Exo-25-3p inhibited I/R-induced inflammatory response in rats. Immunofluorescence
  staining of (A) iNOS and (B) CD163 of myocardial tissue (scale bar, 50 µm). Gene
  expression of proinflammatory cytokines (C) IL-1β and (D) IL-6 in myocardial tissue.
  Gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (E) IL-10 and (F) Arg-1 in myocardial
  tissue. (G) Representative western blotting images of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
  Quantitative analysis of (H) p-JAK2 and (I) p-STAT3. **P<0.01, *P<0.05 vs. Sham
  group. ##P<0.01, #P<0.05 vs. I/R + PBS group. All data were presented as mean ±
  SD. Exo, exosome; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; BMSC, bone marrow mesenchymal stem
  cells; IL, interleukin; Arg-1, Arginase-1; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; p-, phosphorylated;
  STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3'
