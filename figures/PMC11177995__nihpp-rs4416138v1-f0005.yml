caption: The crosstalk of TGF-β1/Smad 2/3 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was
  responsible for the reparative process of WT apoVs on OVX MSCs. (A) Western blot
  assay showed that the TGF-β1/Smad 2/3 signaling pathway was activated while the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was inhibited in OVX MSCs, which was counter-regulated
  by WT apoVs. (B) Western blot assay demonstrated that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway was upregulated after TGF-β1/Smad 2/3 signaling pathway was downregulated
  in OVX MSCs, which was not feasible conversely. (C) ELISA assay showed TGF-β1 secretion
  remained stable before and after apoVs treatment. (D) Western blot assay indicated
  that WT apoVs treatment obviously decreased the expression of TGF-βR2 and DKK-1.
  (E, F) Alizarin red staining and western blot assay both showed that osteogenic
  differentiation was promoted after the downregulation of the TGF-β1/Smad 2/3 pathway
  or the upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (G, H) Flow cytometric analysis
  demonstrated that when the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated, the OVX MSCs showed
  more prominent immunoregulatory capacity. n = 3. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P
