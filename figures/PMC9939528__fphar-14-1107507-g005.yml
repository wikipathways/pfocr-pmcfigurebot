caption: 'SX modulates ASD-induced oxidative stress in the colon through the p62/KEAP1/NRF2/HO1/NQO1
  signaling pathway. (A) Representative immunofluorescence images show the localization
  of NRF2 protein in the colon sections based on staining with the fluorophore-labeled
  anti-NRF2 antibody (red fluorescence). The nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue fluorescence).
  (B) Representative western blot shows the expression levels of p62, KEAP1, NRF2,
  NQO1, HO1, and β-actin proteins in the colons of mice belonging to the CON, ASD,
  ASD + SXL, ASD + SXH, and ASD + S-z groups. β-actin was used as the internal loading
  control. The experiment was repeated three times. (C) The dot plot shows the numbers
  of NRF2 positive cells (based on immunofluorescence staining in A) in the colonic
  mucosa of mice belonging to the CON, ASD, ASD + SXL, ASD + SXH, and ASD + S-z groups.
  p < 0.05, ASD vs. SXL, SXH, and S-z. (D–H) The relative expression levels of p62,
  KEAP1, NRF2, NQO1, and HO1 proteins compared to the β-actin protein levels in the
  colons of mice belonging to the CON, ASD, ASD + SXL, ASD + SXH, and ASD + S-z groups.
  Note: for p62 in (D), p < 0.05, ASD vs. SXL, SXH; p = 0.4302, ASD vs. S-z); for
  KEAP1 in (E), p < 0.05 ASD vs. SXH; p < 0.01 vs. S-z); for NRF2 in (F), p < 0.01,
  ASD vs. SXL, SXH, and S-z); for NQO1 in (G), p < 0.05, ASD vs. SXL, SXH, and S-z;
  for HO1 in (H) p < 0.05, ASD vs. SXH); (I–K) qRT-PCR results show the transcript
  levels of KEAP1, NRF2, and NQO1 compared with the β-actin transcript levels. For
  KEAP1 in (I), p < 0.05, ASD vs. SXH; for NRF2 in (J), p < 0.01 ASD vs. SXL; p <
  0.05, ASD vs. S-z; for NQO1 in (K), p < 0.001 ASD vs. SXL and S-z; p < 0.01, ASD
  vs. SXH; KEAP1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2; NQO1, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1; HO1, heme oxygenase
  1; Data are expressed as means ± SEM. n = 4 per group. Statistical significance
  was determined by one-way ANOVA; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. CON; #p < 0.05, ##p <
  0.01 vs. ASD. ns, no significant. Scale bar: 20 μm.'
