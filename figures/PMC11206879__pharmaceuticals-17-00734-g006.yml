  accessed on 18 April 2024). (B) TFLink gateway (available at https://tflink.net/
  accessed on 18 April 2024) was used to investigate transcription factor–target gene
  interactions. A total of 61 out of 68 genes are indeed NF-κB predicted targets,
  of which, 5 are regulated by all NF-κB subunits and are among those with higher
  correlations. (C) Differential gene expression analysis showed 12 downregulated
  genes and 19 upregulated genes in OS samples and controls (Vulcano Plot generated
  using the Mixed Osteosarcoma (Mesenchymal)-Kuijjer-127-vst-ilmnhwg6v2 dataset).
  KEGG enrichment analysis through the STRING platform showed that downregulated genes
  belong mainly to MAPK and WNT signaling pathways, while upregulated genes are from
  the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT cascades
