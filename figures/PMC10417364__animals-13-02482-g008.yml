figure_title: (A) Scatter plot of KEGG pathway enrichment of differentially expressed
  genes, the vertical coordinate indicates the pathway name, the horizontal coordinate
  is the Enrichment Factor, the color represents the q-value; q-value is the p-value
  after correction for multiple hypothesis testing, and the size of the circle indicates
  the number of enriched genes in the pathway.

  KEGG classification diagram, the vertical axis is the name of the KEGG metabolic
  pathway, the left is the pathway name, and the right is the corresponding classification
  category of each pathway. The same column color indicates the same category
