caption: PPI network and Notch signaling pathway of Lamprey (A) Protein–protein interaction
  (PPI) network of Lr. Notch1 RNA-seq. The size of the two graphs indicates the number
  of interacting proteins and using a color gradient from yellow to blue. The width
  of the lines indicates the protein interaction evaluation score. (B) Notch signaling
  pathway of lamprey. The Notch depicted in the figure is Notch1, while the information
  regarding other molecules is listed in Table S6
