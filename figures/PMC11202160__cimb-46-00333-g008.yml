  pathway.
caption: |-
  Effect of GP extract on gluconeogenesis in IR-HepG2 cells via the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 pathway. (A) The protein expression levels of p-FoxO1 and FoxO1, and the ratios of p-FoxO1/FoxO1; (B) The protein expression levels of PEPCK, the ratios of PEPCK/GAPDH; (C) The protein expression levels of G6Pase, the ratios of G6Pase/GAPDH. Data are expressed as mean Â± S.D. For each group, n = 3. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. IR group (18 mM of GlcN stimulated). ##
  p < 0.01 vs. normal group
