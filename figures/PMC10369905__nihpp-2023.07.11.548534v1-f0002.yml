caption: Evaluation of the performance of ResGit. The distribution of Spearman correlation
  coefficients between predicted and observed gene expression values (A) in the TCGA
  dataset and (B) in the GDSC datasets, respectively. (C). The connectivity map shows
  the similarity of SGA embeddings among the SGAs perturbing common pathways. The
  weight vector connecting an SGA to hidden nodes is used as an embedding of the SGA,
  and similarity between a pair of SGAs is calculated with cosine similarity. If gene
  A is a neighbor of gene B, the arrow direction points from gene B to gene A; a double-arrowed
  edge indicates that two SGAs are mutually among the top 10 neighbors. The thickness
  of an arrow represents the degree of similarity. (D). The attention weights of SGAs
  gene in a pan-cancer analysis. Genes with high overall attention weights are shown
  in red font. (E). The attention weights of SGAs gene across different cancer types
