caption: 'Effect of MIER3–W overexpression on downstream genes in gonadal cells. (A,B)
  Expression of MIER3 gene was detected by qPCR (A) and WB (B) in male gonadal cells
  transfected with overexpression vectors or empty vectors (n = 6 and n = 2, respectively);
  (C) Verification of differentially expressed genes in control and MIER3 overexpression
  groups in chicken embryonic gonadal cells; (D) Dot plots show the KEGG enrichment
  analysis results. Note: Horizontal coordinates indicate the ratio of the number
  of differentially expressed genes annotated on a specific KEGG pathway to the total
  number of differentially expressed genes annotated, and vertical coordinates indicate
  the KEGG pathway. The color indicates the adjusted p-value (padj), the size of the
  dot indicates the number of upregulated differentially expressed genes, and the
  size of the triangle indicates the number of downregulated differentially expressed
  genes. Experimental groups for the DEG screen were gonadal cells with MIER3 overexpression
  vector, not empty vector (n = 3). CLRSP = C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway;
  M = Melanogenesis; TRSP = Toll-like receptor signaling pathway; ESP = ErbB signaling
  pathway; SI = Salmonella infection; PM = Pyrimidine metabolism; GM = Glutathione
  metabolism; RAC = Regulation of actin cytoskeleton; AAM = Arachidonic acid metabolism;
  CDP = Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway; IIN = Intestinal immune network for lgA production;
  CSP = Calcium signaling pathway; NLI = Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction;
  GBS = Glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-heparan sulfate/heparin; ASP = Apelin signaling
  pathway; ASIC = Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes; HM = Histidine metabolism;
  CAM = Cell adhesion molecules; GSP = GnRH signaling pathway; and CCRI = Cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interaction. (E) Relative expression of αGSU in E6 male and female chicken
  embryonic gonads (n = 6); (F) Relative expression of αGSU in male gonadal cells
  transfected with MIER3 overexpression vectors or empty vectors (n = 6); (G) Protein
  levels of EGR1 in male gonadal cells transfected with MIER3 overexpression vectors
  or empty vectors (n = 4). “OE” refers to the overexpression group, and “NC” refers
  to the negative control group. * and ** represent p < 0.05 and p < 0.01. All data
  are presented as mean ± standard deviation'
