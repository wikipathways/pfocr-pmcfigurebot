caption: Examining plasma levels of HMGB-1 in response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and
  associations with neutralization capacity and plasma NO. (a) IPA using the 65-plex
  Human ProcartaPlex Panel for inflammation biomarkers. (b) HMGB-1 signaling pathway
  representation in immune cells. (c) Temporal changes in HMGB-1 concentrations at
  the indicated timepoints pre-vaccination (Pre), and 2â€“10 weeks post-vaccination
  (W2-W10), with green and black dots denoting the LN and HN group, respectively.
  (d) Pearson correlation analysis of pre-vaccination HMGB-1 levels with neutralizing
  antibody capacity at 6-, 8-, and 10-weeks post-vaccination, and the relationship
  between plasma levels of HMGB-1 with nitric oxide pre-vaccination and at 10 weeks
  post-vaccination
