caption: The antidepressant potential of ghrelin, which exerts neuroprotective effects
  by promoting neuronal proliferation and neurotrophic factor production in the brain.
  Ghrelin can inhibit apoptosis, reduce inflammation, increase astrocyte production,
  and significantly inhibit the process of depression. Ghrelin interacts with GHSR1a
  to increase the proliferation of hippocampal NSCs by increasing the expression of
  the Jak2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which also indirectly upregulates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway to jointly exert neuronal protective effects. In addition, ghrelin binding
  to its receptor can also increase the expression of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway,
  play a pro-neural cell proliferation role by promoting the phosphorylation of downstream
  molecules (mTOR and p70S6K), and inactivate GSK-3β by promoting GSK-3β phosphorylation,
  which can further increase the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thus decreasing
  cellular apoptosis, playing a role in promoting cell survival. The activation of
  this pathway also promotes the proliferation of astrocytes and the communication
  of neurons in the brain. Moreover, ghrelin treatment can inhibit the p38-MAPK signaling
  pathway, increase GR expression, and inhibit glucocorticoid resistance in depressed
  patients. Additionally, ghrelin increases CREB phosphorylation by promoting the
  expression of the cAMP/CREB signaling pathway, thus regulating BDNF transcription
  and eventually exerting neuroprotective effects to inhibit depression. Besides this,
  ghrelin levels increase in the regulation of inflammatory response; further, this
  hormone downregulates neutrophil transport and the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  thus reducing inflammation, and it also increases the expression of BDNF and improves
  neurobehavioral function. In the figure, the subtraction symbol indicates inhibitory/suppressing
  action, while the addition symbol indicates stimulatory action. The P labeled in
  the circle represents substrate phosphorylation. ↑, increase; ↓, decrease
