figure_title: FB and SC RosetteArrays detect folate metabolic pathway-specific risk
  with regional differences
caption: (A) Culture schema for MTX/DTG exposure with 5-MTHFA rescue in 12-well FB
  RosetteArrays. (B) Inhibitory effect of 1.0 μM MTX on FB rosette emergence and rescue
  using concurrent 20.0 μM 5-MTHFA treatment. Quantification of MTX dose-response
  on 12-well FB RosetteArray derivation with 20.0 μM 5-MTHFA treatment across (C)
  cells/tissue, (D) neural induction, (E) single rosette emergence, and (F) rosette
  area metrics. Quantification of DTG’s inhibitory effects on 12-well FB RosetteArray
  derivation with increasing 5-MTHFA supplementation across (H) cells/tissue, (I),
  neural induction, (J) single rosette emergence, and (K) rosette area metrics. (L)
  Culture schema for MTX dose-response comparison between 96-well FB and lumbar SC
  RosetteArrays. Dose-response curves of %inhibition of (M) cells/tissue (N) neural
  induction, and (O) single rosette emergence. (C-F, H-K) Each data point is the average
  of technical triplicate, n=50 tissues analyzed per well. (C-F) Three-parameter non-linear
  regression used to model and compare each metric. (H-K) Significance assessed using
  1-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis, * p≤0.05. (M-O) Each data point
  is the average of two biological replicates, each dose in technical quadruplicate,
  n=40 tissues analyzed per well. Four-parameter non-linear regression used to model
  and compare each metric. If curves are statistically equivalent, then only one curve
  is displayed. Scale bars are 100 μm
