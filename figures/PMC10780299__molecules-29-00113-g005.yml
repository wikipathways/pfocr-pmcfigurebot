figure_title: Phytosaponins stimulate the glucocorticoid receptor and activate the
  hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway, leading to the recruitment of MDSCs as well as
  promoting their proliferation and differentiation into M-MDSCs, during which a series
  of cytokines are produced to regulate the immune response of the body.
