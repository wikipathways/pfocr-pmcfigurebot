caption: A simplified illustration of the neurotransmitters and neuroanatomical structures
  involved in the pathophysiology of addiction [, , ]. Other relevant areas are omitted
  for clarity. The effect of dopamine receptors D1-R and D2-R is shown in inset. D1-R
  mediates the direct pathway (positive reinforcement) and D2-R mediates the indirect
  pathway (negative reinforcement). Italic descriptions denote changes secondary to
  chronic drug use. 5-HT, serotonin; AMPAR, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid receptor; D1/2R, dopamine 1/2 receptors; DA, dopamine; GABA, gamma aminobutyric
  acid; NAc, nucleus accumbens; NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; VTA, ventral
  tegmental area. Created with Biorender.com
