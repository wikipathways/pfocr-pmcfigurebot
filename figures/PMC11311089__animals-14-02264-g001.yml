caption: A technical roadmap for the metabolomics technique. The metabolomics technique,
  regardless of the experimental platform, can be divided into five processes, including
  (a) sample preparation, sample processing (metabolite extraction and derivatization),
  chemical analysis (compound identification via platforms, such as NMR, GC−MS, LC−MS),
  (b) data normalization and statistical analysis, and pathway analysis and biological
  interpretation. Created with BioRender.com
