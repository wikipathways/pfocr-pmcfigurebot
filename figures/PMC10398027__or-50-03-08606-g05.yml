caption: Working model of Girdin for migration and angiogenesis in PaCa cells. (A)
  A working model of the involvement of Girdin in the migratory ability of PaCa and
  the inhibitory effect of SCU. Girdin, which binds to actin fibers, is likely activated
  through phosphorylation via the EGF signaling pathway and involved in the migration
  ability of PaCa. SCU suppressed the migration ability of PaCa by inhibiting the
  activation of Girdin through EGF signaling. (B) A working model for the involvement
  of Girdin in the angiogenic ability of PaCa. Girdin appears to enhance angiogenesis
  of human umbilical vein endothelial cells by enhancing transcription and secretion
  of VEGF-A. SCU, which inhibits the phosphorylation of Girdin, had no effects on
  the expression of VEGF-A. Therefore, Girdin was suggested to be involved in the
  expression of VEGF-A through a different pathway. PaCa, pancreatic cancer; SCU,
