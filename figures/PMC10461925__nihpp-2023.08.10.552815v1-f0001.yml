caption: Simplified overview of the flour beetle Toll signaling pathway. I) Pattern
  Recognition Receptors (PRRs) identify pathogen or danger-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs or DAMPs) triggering signal transduction through Toll. This forms an intracellular
  signaling scaffold consisting of MyD88, Tube, and Pelle, resulting in Cactus phosphorylation
  by Pelle. The subsequent degradation of Cactus allows Dif and Dorsal transcription
  factors to translocate into the nucleus, initiating immune effector transcription.
  II) Production of AMPs from Toll signaling proceeds through a sequence of stages,
  starting with constitutive production before infection (A), induction upon parasite
  recognition (B), peak output (C), decay of transcript production, and finally resolution
  of the response (D). Dysfunction in negative regulators could potentially disturb
  signaling dynamics at any stage, leading to overproduction of immune effectors
