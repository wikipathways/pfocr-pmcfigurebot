figure_title: The canonical Shh signalling pathway.
caption: The canonical Shh signalling pathway. (A) When no Shh ligand is present,
  the signalling pathway is inactive. PTCH1 binds to SMO, inhibiting it and preventing
  it from binding to SUFU. SUFU binds GLIFL and KIF7. A protein complex consisting
  of PKA, PK1 and GSK3 binds to and phosphorylates GLIFL. SUFU then cleaves GLIFL
  to GliRepressor consisting of GLI2/3 proteins. GliRepressor moves into the nucleus
  and inhibits transcription of Shh/Gli1 signalling genes. (B) When Shh ligand is
  present, it binds to PTCH1, inhibiting its ability to inactivate SMO. SMO then binds
  to SUFU which is bound to KIF7 and GLIFL. SMO inhibits SUFU to prevent phosphorylation
  of GLIFL, allowing KIF7 to detach from the complex and migrate to the cilia. GLIFL
  cleaved into GLI1/2. The GLI1/2 protein then migrates into the nucleus and initiates
  transcription and translation of PTCH1, NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC and other Shh related
  genes. These proteins then maintain the stem cell properties of the cell, enabling
  replicative immortality. The red X indicates the inhibition of SMO and the Phosphorylation
  of GLIFL is being inhibited
