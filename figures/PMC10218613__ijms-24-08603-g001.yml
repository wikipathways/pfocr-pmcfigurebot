  the NF-κB signaling pathway.
caption: GSK503 concentration-dependently enhances apoptosis in MM cell by inhibiting
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) MM cell apoptosis by flow cytometry after different
  concentrations of GSK503 treatment for 72 h. (B) When the concentrations of GSK503
  (µM) were 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30, the apoptosis increased gradually after 72 h. (C)
  Treatment of OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 cell lines with 10 µM GSK503 for 72 h. GSK503 reduced
  the expression of H3K27me3, the functional protein downstream of EZH2. (D) The changes
  in the apoptosis-related protein cell lines BAX, caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and
  BCL-2 of OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 after 10 µL GSK503 treatment for 72 h. (E) In the OPM-2
  cell line, WB demonstrated that, after 10 µM GSK503 treatment for 72 h, the expressions
  of p65, pp65, and pSTAT3 decreased, accompanied by the increase in IκBα expression,
  (F) and qRT-PCR showed that the expression of NF-κB downstream target genes Bcl-2
  and IL-6 decreased. (B,F) used paired t-tests. p value < 0.05 was considered significant.
  Figure S1 shows the gating strategy for flow cytometry. The results are presented
  as expression percentage and the experimental data are shown in Table S1. * p <
  0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, **** p ≤ 0.0001
