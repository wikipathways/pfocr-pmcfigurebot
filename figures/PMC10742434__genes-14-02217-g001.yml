caption: Gut microbiota–host interplays in tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism, which
  affect mood and emotional states. Based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression,
  disruptions in brain serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine pathways may induce
  depression. The serotonin signaling pathway starts from the raphe nucleus and spreads
  to the entire brain, positively influencing the nucleus accumbence responsible for
  reward and pleasure. The enzymes TPH1 and TPH2 are involved in serotonin synthesis,
  and TH is involved in dopamine synthesis. Serotonin and dopamine can further proceed
  to produce melatonin and noradrenaline, respectively. In brain tissue, these neurotransmitters
  interact with glutamate (excitatory) and GABA (inhibitory) neurotransmitters, which
  are also implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. The gut microbiota and its
  metabolites play a key role in providing substrates and influencing enzymes involved
  in dopamine and serotonin synthesis, consequently affecting noradrenaline (particularly
  in locus coeruleus, LC) and melatonin (in the pineal gland) production. Melatonin
  regulates circadian rhythms, which are often disrupted in depression. Additionally,
  gut microbiota and its metabolites, especially butyrate, help mitigate blood and
  brain inflammation and influence the activity of the vagus nerve, which directly
  communicates with the brain in the medulla oblongata. The red T-shape marks indicate
  inhibition
