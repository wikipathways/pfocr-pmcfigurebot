caption: 'Andrographis paniculata traditionally called as King of Bitters, Kalmegh,
  is a medicinal plant belongs to Acanthaceae family. It is widely distributed through
  Southeast Asia, China, West Indies, America, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan. It has
  bitter taste and colourless appearance. A. paniculata is used in the world as ayurvedic
  and homeopathic medicine, consisting mainly flavonoids (flavone), polyphenols, terpenoids
  (diterpene, lactones, ent-labdane), xanthones, nocordioides. Several andrographolides
  and their derivatives have been demonstrated for immunostimulatory behaviours in
  two ways in recent decades: (1) Antigen specific response (antibodies are insane
  to keep bacteria entering), (2) Non-specific immune response (macrophage cell scavenger
  and capture invaders). Andrographolides and their derivatives also exhibit antiviral,
  anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-diabetic, anti-tumour,
  anti-microbial, hepatoprotective. Andrographolide (6) is the major chemical constituent
  in A. paniculata which is found mainly in leaves. It is chemically known as 3-alpha,
  14, 15, 18-tetrahydroxy-5-beta, 9-betaH, 10-alpha-labda-8, 12-dien-16-oic acid gamma-lactone.
  In vitro studies of andrographolide show that, andrographolide decreases IL-12,
  TNF-alpha, NO, PGE2, COX-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in microglia
  and macrophages, and also block LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 bearing in RAW264.7 murine
  macrophage cell lines. Increasing the cytotoxic ability of lymphocytes is also seen
  in improving CD markers and the construction of TNF-alpha by andrographolide administration.
  Some other studies say that andrographolide enhances the antibody production and
  multiplication of human peripheral blood lymphocytes, cytokines and decreases delayed
  type hypersensitivity response. From the studies of insulinoma tumour, andrographolide
  shows crackdown of proinflammatory proteins bearing iNOS and COX-2 by blocking NF-κB
  binding to DNA, STAT-3 by down-regulation of cytokine 1 and 3 signalling. The andrographolide
  shows better activity on signalling pathways like TLR4/NF-κB for insulinoma tumour
  ,  and possess anti-cancer studies such as enhancement of cell differentiation,
  IL-2, IFN-c, tumour suppressor proteins P53 and P21. It also down regulates the
  cancer cell replication, relocation, cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase and decreased
  E-selectin expression, JAK/STAT/NF-κB signalling pathway. ,,, Anti-viral studies
  of andrographolide shows enhancement of CD4+ T cells against HIV-1 infection and
  blocks dysregulation of cell cycle. They block the HIV virus by inhibiting HL2/3
  adhesion to TZM-bl cells through andrographolide association between gp20 and CD4,
  CCR5, CXCR4. Other studies show down-regulation of herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr
  virus, Dengue virus 1, flavivirus and Pestivirus by andrographolide. Along with
  andrographolide, other constituents () such as neoandrographolide (7), isoandrographolide
  (8), skullcapflavone (9) which are mainly used to reduce inflammation by blocking
  inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, NO, IL-1beta in stimulated LPS- macrophages. Andrographolide
  and 14-deoxy 11, 12-didehydroandrographolide (10) show anti-oxidant activity by
  free radical scavenging effect and lipid peroxidation blocking impact. Some experimental
  studies show that there is a significant enhancement of catalase, superoxide dismutase,
  glutathione-s-transferase subsequently decrease lactate dehydrogenase, thiobarbituric
  acid reactive substance. ,,  Some evidences show that the extract of andrographolide
  reduces the intensity and duration of cold. From a study, we came to understand
  that PHA-induced human peripheral lymphocytes andrographolide increase in lymphocytes
  multiplication and IL-2 production. Andrographolide demonstrates reduction in IL-2
  development with concanavalin-A in vitro in the murine T-cells. Andrographolide
  also block the production of TNF-alpha, IL-12. ,'
