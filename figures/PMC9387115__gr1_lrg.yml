caption: Representation of SARS-CoV-2 viral lifecycle and potential drug targets.
  1. Binding of coronavirus to cellular receptors such as ACE-2 with host factors
  (such as TMPRSS2) promote viral entry via membrane fusion and endocytosis. 2. Translation
  of the viral RNA (polypeptide). 3. Autoproteolysis and co-translational cleavage
  of polypeptide to generate nsps. 4. (-Sense) subgenomic transcription and RNA replication.
  5. (+sense) subgenomic transcription and RNA replication. 6. Translation of subgenomic
  mRNA into structural and accessory proteins. 7. Nucleocapsid buds into ERGIC studded
  with S, E, and M proteins. 8, 9. Finally, virions are secreted from the infected
  cell by exocytosis. Key compounds targeting steps that are attractive therapeutic
  targets are coloured in orange. ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; nsp, non-structural
  proteins; S protein, spike protein; E protein, envelope protein; M protein, membrane
  protein; and TMPRSS2, type 2 transmembrane serine protease. Thapsigargin, a non-competitive
  inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), blocks the ability
  of the cell to pump calcium into the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum and
  causes activation of UPR. Paroxetine, Parthenolide, Sertraline, and Spiperone are
  FDA-approved drugs that compromise ER architecture. Thapsigargin, Paroxetine, Parthenolide,
  Sertraline, and Spiperone are ERS pathway inhibitors and inhibit steps 4–7.
