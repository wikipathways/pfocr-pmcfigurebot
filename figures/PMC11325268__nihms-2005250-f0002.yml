figure_title: TIRR has a p53-dependent metabolic role
caption: (A) TIRR is an inhibitor of the 53BP1/p53 complex.(B) RNA-seq analysis reads
  in the region of the first two exons of the TIRR gene of TIRRWT (n = 3) and TIRRKO
  (n = 3) mice.(C) Lifespan of TIRRWT (n = 4), TIRRHET (n = 16), and TIRRKO (n = 14)
  mice is unchanged.(D) Survival curves over 28 days of TIRRWT (n = 30), TIRRHET (n
  = 17), and TIRRKO (n = 32) mice after exposure to 8.5 Gy total body irradiation
  (TBI). The 8.5 Gy dose was used, as we could achieve a 60% survival in the control
  group after 28 days (Figure S1K).(E) Splenic gene expression of p53 target genes
  3 h post-exposure to 2 Gy TBI of TIRRWT (n = 3) and TIRRKO (n = 3) mice.(F) Body
  weight curves of male TIRRWT (n = 7) and TIRRKO (n = 11) mice fed NCD.(G) Blood
  glucose concentrations during intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test of 13-week-old
  male TIRRWT (n = 18), TIRRHET (n = 24), and TIRRKO (n = 24) mice. Notably, TIRRHET
  mice have similar glucose tolerance to TIRRWT.(H) Linear regression between TIRR
  expression (normalized to GAPDH) and BMI from visceral adipose tissue of patients
  with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 11, R = 0.73, p = 0.010).(I) GSEA of PGAT
  samples of TIRRWT (n = 3) against TIRRKO (n = 4) mice showing significant upregulation
  of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in TIRRKO mice (normalized enrichment score [NES]
  = 1.700, p = 0.003, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.026), significant upregulation
  of the cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling pathway in TIRRKO mice (NES = 1.720,
  p < 0.001, FDR = 0.023), and significant suppression of the cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway in TIRRKO mice (NES = 1.9252, p < 0.0001, FDR = 0.010).(J) Relative gene
  expression levels in differentiated 3T3L1 cells treated with scramble or siTIRR.
  Depicted are means and SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001
