caption: Pathway altered in chickens vaccinated with GVII. The pathways were overlaid
  with the IPA Molecule Activity Predictor (MAP) feature to recognize the unknown
  molecules. Green and red shapes represent down- and up-regulation. The orange and
  blue shapes represent the predicted activation and inhibition of molecules. (a)
  The neuroinflammation signaling pathway; (b) the leukocyte extravasation; (c) the
  role of NFAT in regulating the immune response; and (d) the synaptogenesis signaling
  pathway
