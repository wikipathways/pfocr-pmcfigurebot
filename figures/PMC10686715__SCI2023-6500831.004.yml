caption: Angiogenic effect of exosomes released by different MSCs after MI. Exosomes
  derived from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), adipose-derived mesenchymal
  stem cells (ADMSCs), and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) promote angiogenesis
  by increasing levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), angiogenic fibroblast growth
  factor-β (FGF-β), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Exosomes derived
  from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC-Exos) can upregulate the expression
  of the angiogenic genes Ang1 (also known as ANGPT1) and Flk1 (also known as KDR)
  and downregulate the expression of the antiangiogenic genes Vash1 and TSP1 (also
  known as THBS1). Human amniotic fluid exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells
  (MSC-Exos) promote angiogenesis by increasing the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF
  in fibrotic hearts. Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC-Exos)
  increase capillary density and blood flow in ischemic myocardial tissue by upregulating
  the MAPK and AKT/eNOS pathways. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by BMMSCs
  can promote the angiogenesis of infarcted hearts by regulating the miR-210-Efna3
  pathway. MiR-132 mimics and miR-29b-3p loaded in BMMSC-Exos significantly promote
  neovasculature around the infarcted heart by regulating RASAI gene expression and
  A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs 16 (ADAMTS16) expression,
  respectively. MiR-125a and miR-31 in ADMSC-Exos promote endothelial cell angiogenesis
  by inhibiting the expression of the angiogenic inhibitor delta-like 4 (DLL4) and
  activating the FIH1/HIF-1α pathways, respectively. MiR-543 in human MSC-Exos promotes
  the formation of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells by downregulating the expression
  of COL4A1. miR-1246 in exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem
  cells (hUMSC-Exos) promotes angiogenesis by targeting the PRSS23/Snail/α-SMA axis
