figure_title: Inhibition of necroptosis by Nec-1 relieves muscle structure injury,
  inflammation, and protein degradation induced by LPS in weanling pigs.
caption: 'Inhibition of necroptosis by Nec-1 relieves muscle structure injury, inflammation,
  and protein degradation induced by LPS in weanling pigs. The piglets were pretreated
  with Nec-1 or DMSO for 30 min and then injected with saline or LPS for 4 h. (A,B)
  The concentrations of GH and COR in the plasma. (C) Representative morphological
  characteristics of H&E staining of longissimus dorsi muscle. Arrows indicate muscle-fiber-free
  nuclei (a), inflammatory cell infiltration (b), hemorrhage (c), membrane rupture
  (d), fibroblast hyperplasia (e), and muscle-fiber dissolution and atrophy (f). Original
  magnification: 400×, scale bars = 50 μm. (D–F) Protein and DNA concentrations and
  protein/DNA ratio in muscle. (G–M) mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including
  TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and the key components of muscle protein degradation signaling
  pathway (including Akt, FOXO1, MuRF1, and MAFbx). (N–T) Protein expression of t-Akt,
  p-Akt, t-FOXO1, and p-FOXO1. Data are presented as the means ± SEM, n = 6. abc means
  without a common letter differ (p < 0.05)'
