figure_title: The differential analysis of alternative splicing events in skeletal
  muscle between Duroc and Luchuan pigs.
caption: 'The differential analysis of alternative splicing events in skeletal muscle
  between Duroc and Luchuan pigs. (A) GO analysis of specific AS genes in skeletal
  muscle. (B) KEGG analysis of specific AS genes in skeletal muscle. (C) The differential
  expression of AS genes from the glucagon signaling pathway in skeletal muscle between
  DR and LC pigs. The left panel shows the transcripts expression patterns, the upper
  right panel shows the AS events expression patterns, and the lower right panel shows
  the genes expression patterns. (D) Interaction networks of genes from the glucagon
  signaling pathway. TPM: Transcript per Million. PSI: percentage spliced in. DR:
  Duroc pigs. LC: Luchuan pigs'
