figure_title: Differential expression of chlorophyll metabolic pathways and related
  genes [5].
caption: 'Differential expression of chlorophyll metabolic pathways and related genes
  [5]. Note: Red indicates upward adjustment, blue indicates downward adjustment.
  The heat map of the pathway shows the differential expression level of chlorophyll
  metabolism-related genes in tea leaves at 5 different time points (T6 h, T12 h,
  T18 h, T24 h, F24 h) and the initial time T0 h during 2 photoperiods. Blue and red
  are used to represent the difference multiples after log2, from low to high'
