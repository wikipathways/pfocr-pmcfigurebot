caption: A KEGG enrichment analysis was performed for the DEGs (red column) and DAMs
  (green column) enriched by the same pathway. In the vertical coordinate, red and
  green represent the enrichment values of differential genes and differential metabolites,
  respectively, which are represented by the âˆ’log(p-value), where the higher the enrichment
  degree, the higher the ordinate
