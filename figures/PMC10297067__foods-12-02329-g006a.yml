figure_title: Effect of WNP + GSE on the CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.
caption: Effect of WNP + GSE on the CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway. (A) Immunohistochemical
  staining image of BDNF in the hippocampal CA1 region. (B) Immunohistochemical staining
  imaging map of VAChT in the hippocampal CA1 region. (C) The ratio of BDNF-positive
  surface in the hippocampal CA1 region. (D) Density of BDNF-positive surface in the
  hippocampal CA1 region. (E) Histochemical score of BDNF in the hippocampal CA1 region.
  (F) The ratio of VAChT-positive surface in the hippocampal CA1 region. (G) Density
  of VAChT-positive surface in the hippocampal CA1 region. (H) Histochemical score
  of VAChT in mouse hippocampal CA1 region. (I) Effects of WNP + GSE on the BDNF/TrkB/CREB
  signaling pathway and VAChT levels. Data are expressed as means Â± standard deviation;
  all experiments were repeated three times; N = 3. Different letters represent significant
  differences, p < 0.05
