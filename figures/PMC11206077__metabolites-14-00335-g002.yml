caption: mRNA expression profiling and metabolic impact of the 12-week exercise program.
  (A) Clustering of mRNA levels in skeletal muscle between responders and non-responders
  at baseline. Each row is one person, and the white horizontal line indicates non-responders
  and responders. Blue colour indicates lower and red colour higher mRNA levels. The
  white vertical line divides two main clusters, and each column is one mRNA. (B)
  Pathway analysis of the mRNA clusters from A associated with responders and non-responders.
  (C) Mean mRNA levels related to complex 1–5 in the electron transport chain/oxidative
  phosphorylation. (D) mRNA levels related to key enzymes in the BCAA degradation
  pathway. (E,F) Muscle NEFA and TAG content. (G–I) Waterfall plots of responses in
  mean mRNA levels in electron transport chain/oxidative phosphorylation and BCAA
  degradation, and muscle TAG content. (J) Volcano plot of mRNA changes in muscle
  in responders vs. non-responders in response to 12 weeks of exercise. NR = non-responder;
  R = responder. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01
