figure_title: Aga2+/– perichondrial cell differential expression indicates altered
  cell cycle and accelerated differentiation
caption: (A) Top relevant enriched KEGG pathway analysis terms between WT and Aga2+/–
  in individual perichondrial cell clusters. (B) Heatmap showing differential expression
  of signaling pathway components important in chondro-progenitor differentiation.
  (C) Violin plots showing increased Sox9 and Col2a1 as well as decreased Col1a1 expression
  in perichondrial cell clusters. (D) Heatmap showing differential expression of additional
  cell differentiation and perichondrial markers. NS spaces represent differential
  expression values that were not significant. (E) Violin plots showing increased
  osteoblast differentiation markers as well as decreased Pdgfrb expression in the
  osteoblast progenitor cluster. * = P < 0.05
