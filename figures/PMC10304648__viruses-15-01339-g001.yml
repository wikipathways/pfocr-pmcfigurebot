caption: The detection of influenza A virus infection by pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) and NLRP3 inflammasome. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can be detected
  by various host sensors that recognize distinct features associated with the infection.
  Following endocytosis-mediated virus entry, viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) are
  released into the nucleus for transcription and replication. ssRNA is recognized
  by TLR7 in the acidified endosomes, and TLR7 signaling triggers the expression of
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and other pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, along with the IRF7 phosphorylation-dependent generation of type I interferons
  (IFNs). Infected cells are phagocytosed, allowing for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
  recognition by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which results in the expression of NF-κB-dependent
  pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as type I interferons
  (IFNs) downstream of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The viral RNA in the cytosol
  is detected by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), which activates mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and induces type I IFNs. Matrix 2 (M2) ion channel
  activity in the Golgi apparatus stimulates the formation of the NACHT, LRR and PYD
  domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, leading to caspase 1 activation,
  gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, and the release of cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 via GSDMD
  N-terminal-formed pores. PB1-F2 fibrils accumulate in the phagosome, which results
  in the activation of NLRP3 and the release of IL-1β and IL-18. The bacterial strain
  B. pseudolongum NjM1 produces acetate, which enhances viral RNA-triggered MAVS aggregation
  through GPR43 and NLRP3; such elevated MAVS aggregation promotes subsequent IRF3
  activation and IFN-I production. To evade immune responses, the IAV protein PB1-F2
  suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing mitochondrial fragmentation
  and mitophagy, and NS1 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation and blocks the RIG-I
  signaling pathway. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GPR43, G-protein-coupled receptor
