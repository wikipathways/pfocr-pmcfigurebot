figure_title: Sodium selenite induces autophagy and apoptosis in HeLa and SiHa cells.
caption: 'Sodium selenite induces autophagy and apoptosis in HeLa and SiHa cells.
  (A) Volcano plot displaying the distribution of DEGs, highlighting significant genes
  in AMPK, FOXO, and apoptosis signaling pathways. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis showing
  significant enrichment of DEGs in AMPK, FOXO, and apoptosis pathways. (C) Quantitative
  analysis of the change in the percentage of MDC-positive cells after CQ pretreatment
  was performed using flow cytometry. (D) Changes in LC3-II protein levels after CQ
  pretreatment. (E) Quantitative analysis of the percentage of MDC-positive cells
  after SS treatment at different times and doses. (F) The percentage of apoptotic
  cells was detected and quantified using flow cytometry. (G) Protein expression levels
  of autophagy markers (LC3-II and p62) and apoptosis markers (cleaved-caspase3 and
  cleaved-PARP). All experiments were repeated at least three times. Con: Control;
  SS: sodium selenite; CQ: Chloroquine diphosphate salt; c-PARP: cleaved-PARP; c-caspase3:
  cleaved-caspase3'
