caption: Nontargeted serum metabolomics analysis of the effects of EVO intervention
  on SPS-stimulated mice. (A) Score plots of PLS-DA for the normal and model groups,
  as well as the administered and model groups under negative ion mode. The horizontal
  axis represents the first principal component, the vertical axis represents the
  second principal component and the number following each principal component denotes
  the explained variance. (B) OPLS-DA substitution detection and score plots for the
  normal and model groups, and the administration and model groups under negative
  ion mode. R2Y and Q2 indicate the explained variance and predictability of the model,
  respectively. The horizontal axis of the plots represents the Spearman correlation
  coefficients between postdisruption and predisruption sample groupings. A correlation
  coefficient closer to 1 signifies a better fit. Typically, a Q2 value ≥ 0.2 is considered
  indicative of model reliability. (C) Correlation plots displaying differentially
  abundant metabolites between the normal and model groups, as well as the administered
  and model groups in negative ion mode. For positive correlation, the linear relationship
  tends toward 1 between two metabolites, whereas for negative correlation, it tends
  toward −1. Significance testing for metabolite correlation analysis was conducted,
  with a chosen threshold of p value < 0.05 indicating a significant correlation.
  (D) Cluster analysis plots were generated for comparing metabolites with significant
  differences between the normal group and the model group, and between the administration
  group and the model group, in negative ion mode. The horizontal axis represents
  sample numbers and their clustering relationship, while the vertical axis indicates
  the clustering relationship of metabolites. (E) Statistical plot of HMDB and LIPID
  statistics in negative ion mode. The horizontal axis displays the percentage of
  each metabolite type relative to the total number of entries, and the left vertical
  axis represents subclass entries. (F) KEGG statistical plot and pathway enrichment
  bubble plot in negative ion mode. The KEGG statistics plot illustrates the percentage
  of each metabolite type relative to the total number of entries on the horizontal
  axis, with subclasses (subclass) on the left vertical axis and major classes (class)
  on the right vertical axis. The KEGG pathway enrichment bubble plot presents the
  ratio on the horizontal axis, individual pathway names on the vertical axis, and
  colors representing the degree of enrichment (−log10(p value)), with circle size
  indicating the number of metabolic pathways
