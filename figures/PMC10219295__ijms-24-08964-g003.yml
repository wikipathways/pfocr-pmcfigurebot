figure_title: ROS production induced by 5-ALA-PDT in cancer cells.
caption: ROS production induced by 5-ALA-PDT in cancer cells. 5-ALA is a pro-photosensitizing
  endogenous metabolite converted in PpIX in the heme biosynthetic pathway. PpIX accumulation
  in cancer cells is commonly higher than that in normal cells, as cancer cells are
  deficient in some enzymes of the pathway. In cancer cells, the presence of molecular
  oxygen and the excitation of PpIX under irradiation produces ROS that cause DNA
  and cell membrane injury through lipid peroxidation. This reaction results in damage
  to mitochondria and other cellular organelles and finally cellular death
