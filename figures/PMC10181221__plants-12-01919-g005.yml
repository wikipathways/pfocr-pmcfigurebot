caption: 'Effect of A. hookeri extract on β-Catenin, NRF2, and NF-κB signaling pathway
  in HDPCs. (A) β-Catenin stabilization assessed via Western blotting with β-Actin
  serving as a loading control. (B) Nuclear translocation of β-Catenin, NRF2, and
  NF-κB assessed via Western blotting. α-Tubulin and Lamin A/C served as loading controls
  for the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. Quantification of the protein
  level was carried out using ImageJ. The results are presented as the mean ± SD of
  three independent experiments and analyzed with one-way ANOVA analysis followed
  by Tukey’s test. AHE, Allium hookeri extract; HDPCs, human dermal papilla cells.
