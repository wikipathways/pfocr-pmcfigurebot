caption: Vitamin D3 alleviates fibrosis and apoptosis in HK-2 cells by inhibiting
  oxidative stress and the TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammatory pathway. (A) Detection of 8-OHDG
  in mouse urine by ELISA (n=6). Expression of (B) NLRP3, (C) E-cadherin, (D) TXNIP,
  (E) α-SMA and (F) Bax/Bcl2 in cells detected by reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR. (G) Expression of (H) NLRP3, (I) E-cadherin, (J) Bax/Bcl2, (K) α-SMA and (L)
  TXNIP in cells detected by western blot. n=4. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. TXNIP,
  thioredoxin interacting protein; VD3, vitamin D3; 8-OHDG, 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine;
  α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; STZ, streptozotocin; HG, high glucose
