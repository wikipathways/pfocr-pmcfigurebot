figure_title: Dietary arginine supplementation could activate mTORC1-mediated protein
  metabolism in Litopenaeus vannamei.
caption: Dietary arginine supplementation could activate mTORC1-mediated protein metabolism
  in Litopenaeus vannamei. (A) shows the crude protein content and expression of genes
  related to the mTORC1 signaling pathway in the hepatopancreas; (B) shows the total
  ovarian protein and expression of genes related to the TOR pathway in the ovary.
  a, b, c, d, and mean values of bars for the same parameter with different superscript
  letters were significantly different (p < 0.05). Data were reported as the means
  and SE of 3 replicates. Data with different superscripts significantly differed
  based on one-way ANOVA analysis (p < 0.05). * means that the regression model was
  extremely and significantly suitable (p < 0.05), ** means that the regression model
  was extremely and significantly suitable (p < 0.01), *** means that the regression
  model was extremely and significantly suitable (p < 0.001), while ns means that
  the regression model was not suitable (p > 0.05) in the orthogonal polynomial contrasts
  analysis. Protein kinase B, akt; ras homologue enriched in brain, rheb; target of
  rapamycin, torc1; regulatory-associated protein of mTOR, raptor; ribosomal protein
  S6 kinase, s6k; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, eif4e; 4E-binding protein,
  4e-bp
