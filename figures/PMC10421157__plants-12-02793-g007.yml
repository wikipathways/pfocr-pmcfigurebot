figure_title: DEGs identified in “plant hormone pathways”.
caption: DEGs identified in “plant hormone pathways”. (a) The types of hormones in
  the “plant hormone pathway” and the number of DEGs belonging to these types. (b–f)
  Heatmap clustering of the 46 DEGs related to auxin (IAA, (b)), abscisic acid (ABA,
  (c)), ethylene (ETH, (d)), Jas monic acid (Jas, (e)), and salicylic acid (SA, (f))
  in non–treated and salt–treated RILpur–W22 and RILbro–W22 seedlings (NT–RILpur–W22,
  salt–RILpur–W22, NT–RILbro–W22, and salt–RILbro–W22). Each sample has two compartments,
  which are two biological replicates. According to the standardized FPKM, red and
  blue indicate high and low abundance, respectively
