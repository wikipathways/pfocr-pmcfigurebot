figure_title: Rescue of genes implicated in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism
  with SMN repletion in day 24 SMA type 1 iHeps
caption: (A) RT-qPCR of mitochondrial OXPHOS-related genes. (B) RT-qPCR of lipid transport
  genes. For ALB, one outlier from 1-38G was removed using the ROUT test with a maximum
  FDR of 1%. For APOA1, 2 outliers from isogenic (Iso) carriers and 1 outlier from
  Iso WT was removed. (C) RT-qPCR of lipid and cholesterol synthesis pathway genes.
  For SREBP1, one outlier from Iso carriers was removed. (D) RT-qPCR of fatty acid
  β-oxidation pathway genes. For CPT2, one outlier from Iso. WT was removed. In A–D,
  data are from 3 to 4 independent experiments. Unless specifically indicated that
  outliers were removed, analysis of data from 3 independent experiments included
  9 samples (n = 9) each for WT, Iso WT, and Iso carrier conditions. Similarly for
  analysis of data from 4 independent experiments, n = 12 for each condition. For
  1-38G, n ≥ 4 for all experiments. Data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
  multiple-comparison test and are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
  ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001
