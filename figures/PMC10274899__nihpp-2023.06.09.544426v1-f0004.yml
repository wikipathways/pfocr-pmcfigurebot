figure_title: Genes with differentially methylated CpGs are associated with key biological
  processes in the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
caption: (A) ERBB signaling pathway was significant associated with dmCpGs from the
  second eribulin treatment. (B) VEGF signaling pathway were associated with hypermethylated
  CpGs from the second eribulin treatment. (C) Heatmap depicting the levels of cytokines
  and chemokines determined through a multiplex cytokine assay. ZEB1 binding levels
  at (D) NKFB1, (E) NKFB2, and (F) VEGFA in untreated and eribulin treated cells
