caption: 'Overview of the inhibition of DNA-sensing pathways by KSHV viral proteins.
  Left: KSHV-encoded viral proteins antagonize the cGAS–STING–TBK1–IRF3/7-interfering
  signaling pathway. Middle: KSHV proteins antagonize the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  Right: KSHV proteins antagonize the inflammasome signaling pathway. The solid red
  lines indicate inhibition'
