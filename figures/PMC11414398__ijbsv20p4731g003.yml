figure_title: Effect of METTL18 on the Src kinase signaling pathway.
caption: 'Effect of METTL18 on the Src kinase signaling pathway. (A) Significantly
  altered pathways in the RNA-seq analysis of shMETTL18 #2795-expressing MDA-MB-231
  cells (cutoff for p-value < 0.01). (B) Heatmap of phospho-protein array data. Samples
  were prepared from METTL18-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. (C) Immunoblotting for
  the phospho- and total forms of tyrosine kinases (Src, STAT3, and p85) in Myc-METTL18-overexpressing
  or shMETTL18-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Transfection efficacy of the Myc-METTL18
  construct and shMETTL18 was verified by immunoblotting with anti-Myc and anti-METTL18,
  respectively. Î²-actin was used as the loading control. (D) Western blotting results
  for the phospho- and total protein levels of Src in siPIMT (20 nM)-, siEEF2KMT (20
  nM)-, and siPRMT1 (20 nM)-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells after 48 hours. (E) Scatterplot
  showing the correlation between p-Src and METTL18 in breast cancer patients from
  Samsung''s cohort. Source data for the scatterplot were obtained from immunoblotting
  (Fig. S5). P-values and the correlation coefficient (R) were calculated using GraphPad
  Prism. (F) Kaplan-Meier curve showing the survival probability of HER2-negative
  breast cancer patients with high or low expression of p-Src Y419 (best cutoff).
  (G) Invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Myc, Myc-METTL18, shScramble,
  or shSrc. The transfection efficacy of the plasmids and shRNA was verified by Western
  blotting with anti-Myc and anti-Src. The blots shown in (C), (D), and (G) are representative
  images of three independent Western blot experiments. ns: not significant; * P <
  0.05; ** P < 0.01; ## P < 0.01'
