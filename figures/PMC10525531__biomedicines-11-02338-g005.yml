figure_title: The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways were activated in CAG gastric tissue.
caption: 'The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways were activated in CAG gastric tissue.
  (A) IL-6 immunofluorescence staining in the gastric tissue of patients (Scale bar
  = 100 or 50 μm, n = 3). (B) The mean density of IL-6-positive cells in Panel (A).
  (C) p-STAT3 immunofluorescence staining of the gastric tissue of patients (Scale
  bar = 100 or 50 μm, n = 3). (D) The mean density of p-STAT3-positive cells in Panel
  (C). The bottom images were the larger images of the frame in the top images, and
  the arrows indicate the location of IL-6-positive cells (A) or p-STAT3-positive
  cells (C). (E) IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β immunofluorescence staining in the gastric
  tissue of CAG rats (n = 3). (F) The expression of IL-6 and the ratio of p-STAT3/STAT3
  in the gastric tissue of CAG rats, as determined by Western blotting (n = 4). The
  data are presented as the mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. NAG or Con groups.
  NAG: non-atrophic gastritis patients; CAG: chronic atrophic gastritis patients or
  rats; Con: the control group of rats'
