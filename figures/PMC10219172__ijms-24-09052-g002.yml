caption: The effect of nitric oxide on seed germination under light. In the presence
  of red light, PHYB moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and promotes seed germination
  promoting expression of the 26S proteasome pathway leading to PIF1 degradation.
  NO accumulation under red light conditions not only inhibited PIF1 transcription
  but also enhanced the HFR1-PIF1 interaction, ultimately leading to a weakened inhibitory
  effect of PIF1 on seed germination. SOM as a direct target gene downstream of PIF1,
  can affect the expression levels of related genes in the ABA and GA signaling pathways
  in photochrome-dependent photomorphogenesis. Light-mediated an antagonism relationship
  between NO and GA. During seed germination, NO content and PLD activity are increased
  by light. The arrows and bars indicate positive and inhibitory effects, respectively.
