caption: Torenia sp. extract induces germline abnormalities and influences worm survival.Â Torenia
  sp. extracts trigger a DNA damage response pathway, resulting in impaired germline
  development and increased apoptosis, and interfere with meiotic progression. This
  underscores the potential cytotoxicity of Torenia sp. extracts. Furthermore, the
  presence of compounds with known antitumor activity in Torenia sp. extracts, including
  those shared with Onobrychis cornuta and Veratrum lobelianum, suggests the possibility
  of utilizing Torenia species in anti-cancer therapeutics beyond traditional gardening
  applications. Photographed by Nickrent et al. (http://www.phytoimages.siu.edu, accessed
