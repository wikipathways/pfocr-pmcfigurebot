figure_title: Two consecutive signals are requisite for inflammasome activation.
caption: 'Two consecutive signals are requisite for inflammasome activation. The activation
  of inflammasome requires the priming signal (Signal 1) and the activation signal
  (Signal 2). Priming signal (Signal 1): pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  or damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS) act as priming signals to activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway through binding to Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs), thereby increasing the expression of downstream proteins such as nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), pro-interleukin
  (IL)-1β, and pro-IL-18. Activation signal (Signal 2): under the stimulation of PAMPs/DAMPs,
  K+ efflux and the presence of cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are common
  activation signals that induce the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome and absent in
  melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome, respectively, and other upstream events including
  lysosome-released cathepsins, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and
  mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are also needed for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Then,
  inactive pro-caspase-1 transforms into active caspase-1 via self-cleavage, which
  subsequently mediates pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to cleave into mature IL-1β and IL-18,
  triggering inflammation. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is also cleaved by caspase-1 into the
  N-terminal fragment of GSDMD (GSDMD-N), which forms oligomeric pores in the cell
  membrane and releases inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18, leading to pyroptosis'
