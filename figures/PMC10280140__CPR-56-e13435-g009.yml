caption: Overexpression of p70 S6K induces activated myofibroblast differentiation
  and ECM production through downregulating apoptosis and autophagy while enhancing
  cellular senescence. Canine qVICs were transfected with human p70 S6K cDNA ORF plasmids,
  mouse p70 S6K cDNA ORF plasmids, pcDNA3.1 plasmids (vectors) and Lipofectamine 3000
  (Mock) with or without 5 μM of baflomycin‐A1 (Baf‐A1). (A) Representative western
  blot of p70 S6K, phosphorylated p70 S6K (p‐p70 S6K), VIC phenotype and ECM protein
  expression and quantification of the relative protein expression (n = 6). (B) p70
  S6K overexpressed qVICs were exposed to 5 μM Baflomycin‐A1. Representative western
  blot of ATG7 and LC3‐II protein expression and quantification of the relative protein
  expression (n = 6). (C) Representative confocal images of LC3‐II labelled autophagosomes
  (green) and quantitative analysis of the number of LC3‐II puncta, scale bar 20 μm
  (n = 98 cells/treatment). (D) Representative western blot of caspase‐3, cleaved
  caspase‐3, p16INK4A, p21CIP1 and p53 protein expression and quantification of the
  relative protein expression (n = 6). (E) Representative images of SA‐β‐gal (blue)
  staining and quantitative analysis of the percentage of SA‐β‐gal positive cells,
  scale bar 50 μm (n = 12 microscopic fields). (F) Quantitative RT‐PCR for senescence‐associated
  secretory phenotype (SASP) cytokine expression (left panel) in qVICs transfected
  with p70 S6K cDNA ORF plasmids (n = 6). Quantification of secreted TGF‐β1, IL‐6
  and MMP‐9 (right panel) in collected supernatant from qVIC cultures overexpressing
  p70 S6K (n = 6). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. ANOVA followed by Tukey's
  range test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to control. ANOVA, analysis
  of variance; ECM, extracellular matrix; VIC, valve interstitial cell.
