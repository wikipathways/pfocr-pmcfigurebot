figure_title: Proposed mechanism of apixaban’s modulatory effects on factor Xa and
  associated inflammatory signaling pathways in an osteoarthritic chondrocyte model.
caption: 'Proposed mechanism of apixaban’s modulatory effects on factor Xa and associated
  inflammatory signaling pathways in an osteoarthritic chondrocyte model. This illustration
  delineates the pathways through which apixaban may exert anti-inflammation in the
  context of osteoarthritis. Apixaban targets FXa, inhibiting its ability to bind
  and activate PAR2, which is represented by the red inhibitory line. This intervention
  most likely attenuates the downstream signaling cascades involved in OA pathophysiology:
  1. PAR2 inhibition: The blockage of PAR2 activation by apixaban may ameliorate the
  downstream signaling events mediated by ERK1/2 that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, potentially alleviating chronic pain associated
  with OA. 2. Cytokine modulation: The expected reduction in TNF-α and IL-1β due to
  apixaban’s action on FXa mitigates the upregulation of molecules like MCP-1, which
  are involved in monocyte recruitment and the NF-κB signaling pathway, both key contributors
  to inflammation and osteoclastogenesis. 3. Protein expression: The illustration
  also indicates the potential effects of apixaban on the expression of regulatory
  proteins, including SOX4 and ADAMTS5, and their impact on critical components like
  aggrecan, which is essential for cartilage integrity. 4. Chondrocyte integrity and
  bone health: By modulating these inflammatory and catabolic pathways, apixaban may
  help preserve chondrocyte integrity, mitigate the generation of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), and contribute to maintaining joint health by potentially impacting
  the RANK/RANKL pathway, which is crucial for osteoclast activity and bone resorption'
