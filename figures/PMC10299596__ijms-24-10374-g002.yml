caption: Intrinsic apoptosis pathway and venetoclax resistance in CLL. (A) Upon activation
  of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by cellular stress, BH3-only proteins inhibit
  the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2, BCL-xL, and MCL1. This inhibition leads to the
  activation and oligomerization of Bak and Bax, resulting in mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization (MOMP). MOMP-mediated release of cytochrome c and SMAC
  leads to the formation of apoptosome, which results in the activation of caspase
  proteins leading to cell death. The anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins inhibit this process
  by sequestering the pro-apoptotic proteins by binding to their BH3 motifs. (B) In
  CLL, BCL2 is overexpressed in 20â€“40% of the cases. The loss of miR-15 and miR-16
  miRNAs leads to increased levels of BCL2, providing a survival advantage for the
  tumor. (C) Venetoclax induces apoptosis by binding to BCL2 protein, which is commonly
  found to be overexpressed in CLL. (D) Among venetoclax resistance mechanisms (i)
  BCL2 point mutations, which reduce the affinity for venetoclax (ii) upregulation
  of MCL-1 and BCL-xL abrogates venetoclax antitumor effect
