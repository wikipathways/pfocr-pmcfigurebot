figure_title: Small intestinal epithelial cells of Plcb3−/− mice exhibit downregulation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
caption: 'Small intestinal epithelial cells of Plcb3−/− mice exhibit downregulation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A) GSEA indicates that the gene expression
  pattern in isolated IECs from Plcb3−/− mice correlates with the reduced expression
  of Wnt/β-catenin signature genes (upper left), Lgr4 regulated signature genes (lower
  left), Lgr4/Lgr5 regulated signature genes (upper right), and Ascl2 signature genes
  (lower right). NES: normalized enrichment score. n = 3 biological replicates. (B)
  qRT-PCR analysis of isolated IECs from WT and Plcb3−/− mice exposed to sterilized
  water or 3% DSS for 2 days. Normalized against Hprt mRNA. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01;
  *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001, determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test. (C) GSEA
  with isolated IECs from Plcb3 ∆IEC mice indicated the reduced expression of Wnt/β-catenin
  (upper left), Lgr4 (lower left), Lgr4/Lgr5 (upper right), and Ascl2 (lower right)
  signature genes at the homeostatic condition. (D) Small intestines of WT and Plcb3−/−
  mice exposed to sterilized water or 3% DSS for 2 days were separated into mesenchymal
  tissues. RNAs isolated were subjected to qRT-PCR analysis. mRNA amounts for several
  Wnt ligands and Wnt secretion enablers (Wls and Porcn) were normalized against Hprt.
  * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, determined by Student’s t-test. (E) Western blot analysis
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling proteins from WT and Plcb3−/− mice (3 mice each) under
  H2O and 2-day DSS treatments'
