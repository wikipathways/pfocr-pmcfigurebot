figure_title: Comparison of NP- and tonsil-derived ASCs
caption: (A) Violin plots of genes upregulated in NP- and tonsil-derived ASCs. (B)
  GO biological process performed on most variable genes in ASCs derived from NPs
  and tonsils. Wilcoxon’s test was used for gene comparisons. (C) GSEA was performed
  on the top 2,000 most variable features in ASCs derived from NPs and tonsils. NF-κB
  ranked as the most-enriched signaling pathway in NPs
