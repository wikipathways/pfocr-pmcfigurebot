figure_title: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for upregulated DEGs in treated groups.
caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for upregulated DEGs in treated groups.
  (A) Significantly enriched (p < 0.05) pathways of upregulated DEGs in NMN treatment.
  (B) Significantly enriched (p < 0.05) pathways of upregulated DEGs in CoQ10 treatment.
  GeneRatio represents the ratio of enriched DEGs to total DEGs. The size and color
  of the dots indicate the number and significance of DEGs enriched in the KEGG pathway,
  respectively
