figure_title: Comparing the clinical and molecular features between high- and low-risk
  patients in the training cohort.
caption: 'Comparing the clinical and molecular features between high- and low-risk
  patients in the training cohort. (A) The box plot showed that high-risk patients
  have an older-age distribution than low-risk patients; (B) Analysis of the mutation
  profiles of the fifty most commonly mutated genes in human cancers showing that
  27 genes had a significantly different mutation frequency between low-risk and high-risk
  patients; (C) The box plot showed that high-risk patients have a higher TMB than
  low-risk patients; (D) The box plot showed that high-risk patients have a higher
  neoantigen load than low-risk patients; (E) The box plot showed that high-risk patients
  have a higher MSI than low-risk patients; (F) The box plot showed that high-risk
  patients have a higher cytolytic score than low-risk patients; (G) The box plot
  showed that high-risk patients have a higher hypoxia score than low-risk patients;
  (H) The relative signaling pathway activity in high- and low- risk patients was
  evaluated by the R package “progeny”; (I) The violin plot showed the ssGSEA score
  of fifty pathways of cancer hallmarks in high- and low-risk patients. Abbreviations:
  TMB, tumor mutation burden; MSI, microsatellite instability. *: p < 0.05, **: p
  < 0.01, ***: p < 0.001'
