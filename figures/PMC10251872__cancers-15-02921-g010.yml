figure_title: Differential DNA promoter methylation of inflammation-related gene pathways.
caption: Differential DNA promoter methylation of inflammation-related gene pathways.
  The genes within the pathways are arranged on the x-axis by methylation level; there
  are multiple probes for a gene, and gene symbols for all the genes in a given pathway
  could not be presented in the figure. Methylation Beta value is shown on the y-axis.
  CRC tissue is shown in blue, and the corresponding adjacent normal tissue is shown
  in red
