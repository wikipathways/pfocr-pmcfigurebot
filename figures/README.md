This folder holds the resulting .jpg and .yml files from a PMC figure query. New files will be added by consecutive runs.

You can add figures to PFOCR by submitting an issue using the `Fetch this figure` template.

You can also manually deposit pairs of files, following these guidelines. They will be processed in the next batch.

1. **Image file.** This must be jpeg format with .jpg extension. The filename must include the PMCID and figure filename separated by double underscore, e.g., PMC5541263__41388_2017_Article_BFonc2016467_Fig8_HTML.jpg.
2. **Metadata file.** This must be yaml format with .yml extension, and with the same filename as the associated image file, e.g., PMC5541263__41388_2017_Article_BFonc2016467_Fig8_HTML.yml. The file should include the following fields and syntax (including start and end lines with triple dashes). Note: keywords should always be formated a list (like below).
