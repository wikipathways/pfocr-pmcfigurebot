figure_title: Corylin inhibits HSC activation by suppressing GAS6 expression and downstream
  PI3K/AKT signaling.
caption: Corylin inhibits HSC activation by suppressing GAS6 expression and downstream
  PI3K/AKT signaling. (A) Western blotting results of cell lysates of HHSteC cells
  treated with corylin or DMSO for 2 h, followed by TGF-β (4 ng/mL) treatment for
  24 h to stimulate cell activation and to determine the effects of corylin on the
  GAS6/AXL signaling pathway. β-Actin is the internal control. Quantitative results
  are shown in (B,C). All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviations of
  three independent experiments. p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***). HSCs,
  hepatic stellate cells; GAS6, growth arrest-specific gene 6; PI3K/AKT, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase/protein kinase B; p-PI3K, phosphorylated PI3K; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide;
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; COL1A1, collagen 1A; α-SMA, smooth muscle-actin
