figure_title: Trancriptional changes and pathway alterations during adaptation to
  anoikis over time
caption: (A). UpSet plots highlighting the number of Up Regulated Genes (A) (p value
  < 0.05 and L2FC >1.5) and Down Regulated genes (B) (p value < 0.05 and L2FC < âˆ’1.5)
  in OV90 across the time point comparisons P0 vs P1, P0 vs P3, P0 vs P4, P0 vs P6,
  and P0 vs P7 as indicated. (C) Heatmap for the individual samples using Log2FC as
  calculated for individual biological replicates for parental (P0 cells) (P0A-C),
  P1 (P1A-C), P3 (P3A-C), P4 (P4A-C), P6 (P6A-C), and P7 (P7A-C). Respective attached
  and suspension time points are indicated. Heatmap generated by clustering analysis
  of DEGs across samples. The Log2 fold changes of each gene were clustered based
  on euclidean distance. (D). Heatmaps for the individual OV90 samples using GSVA
  normalized enrichment scores (NES) for passage 0 (P0A-C), 1 (P1A-C), 3 (P3A-C),
  4 (P4A-C), 6 (P6A-C), and 7 (P7A-C). The hallmarks were clustered based on euclidean
  distance. (E) Scatterplot showing the NES for samples on a 2-dimensional epithelial
  mesenchymal plane. (F) Scatterplot showing the NES for apoptosis and the NES for
  Oxidative Phosphorylation across time points for each sample in the replicates for
  OV90. (G) Scatterplot showing the NES for apoptosis and the NES for MYC Targets
  V2 for each time point for OV90
