figure_title: Effects of ARA on apoptotic death pathways.
caption: 'Effects of ARA on apoptotic death pathways. (A) (1) Treatment with ARA induces
  an increase in oxidative stress through the production of ROS and lipid peroxidation.
  This leads to elevated levels of MDA, 4-HNE, SOD, and GSH-PX activity. (2) Furthermore,
  the elevated ROS levels and intracellular calcium concentration activate the p38α
  MAPK and JNK1 pathways. (3) ARA also triggers ER stress, characterized by high levels
  of pXBP1 and phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α). (4) Another mechanism involves the
  accumulation of unmetabolized ARA, which activates the enzyme SMase, resulting in
  elevated ceramide levels—an important second messenger and potent activator of apoptosis.
  (5) These mechanisms collectively lead to the association of Bax protein with mitochondria,
  downregulation of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release
  of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and activation of caspase-9
  and -3. (6) This cascade ultimately results in the breakdown of PPAR and DNA fragmentation.
  (B) (7) In the extrinsic pathway, ARA increases the expression of FAS, caspases-8,
  and -3. (C) On the other hand, ARA induces anti-apoptotic effects by activating
  survival and proliferation pathways, such as the Akt axis. (8) Additionally, 12-HETE
  triggers the activation of the ILK/NF-κB axis. (9) Another novel mechanism suggests
  that during apoptosis, active caspase-3 can activate ciPLA2, leading to the release
  of ARA and the production of PGE2. This abnormal activation of FAK promotes proliferation.
  Furthermore, downregulation of active caspases 3, 8, and 9 has been reported. ARA:
