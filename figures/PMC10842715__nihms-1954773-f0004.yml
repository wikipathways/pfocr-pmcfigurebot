figure_title: Metabolic tracking of radiolabeled lipid precursors of TAG
caption: (A) TAG biosynthetic pathways. Radioactive substrate used in this study is
  highlighted in red. Enzymes are in blue and the major lipid precursors (PC and DAG)
  and the final product (TAG) are in bold. CPT, choline phosphotransferase; DGAT,
  acyl-Co-A:DAG acyltransferase; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate
  acyltransferase; LPA, lysoPA; LPAT, LPA acyltransferase; LPC, lysoPC; LPCAT, LPC
  acyltransferase; PAH, PA phosphohydrolase; PDAT, PC:DAG acyltransferase; PDCT, PC:DAG
  cholinephosphotransferase.(B) Pulse labeling. The 10 DAF seeds of WT, lhycca1, and
  LHY-OE were incubated with [14C]-acetate for the indicated time. Total lipids were
  extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography. Radioactivities of TAG, DAG,
  and PC were measured and are shown here as per microgram chlorophyll of the seeds.(C)
  Pulse-chase labeling. The 10 DAF seeds pre-incubated with [14C]-acetate for 3 h
  were washed to remove radioisotopes and further incubated for the indicated time.
  Lipids were processed and analyzed as in (B). Values in (B) and (C) are mean ± SD
  with asterisks (*) denoting statistical significance determined by Student’s t test
  (to WT; n = 5 groups of seeds; p < 0.05). See also Figures S3 and S4
