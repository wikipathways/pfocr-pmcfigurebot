  process of remyelination.
caption: 'The effects of different CRMs on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and the process
  of remyelination. Metformin administration promotes the recruitment of OPCs to the
  lesion site and attenuates demyelination through its ability to reduce oxidative
  stress and upregulate antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, metformin promotes OPC proliferation
  via the blockage of autophagy and enhances OPC differentiation and maturation into
  myelinating OLs via CBP phosphorylation. The remyelination process is also enhanced
  by the modulation of AMPK/mTORC pathways in mature OLs. Apart from metformin, NAM
  and resveratrol can promote the remyelination process. NAM treatment promotes the
  maturation of OPCs via the BDNF/TrkB pathway. Resveratrol protects OLs by reducing
  the abundance of ROS while it also induces autophagy through the activation of SIRT1,
  a mechanism that likely supports remyelination. Finally, direct NAD+ supplementation
  facilitates the recruitment of OPCs and alleviates demyelination through the activation
  of the SIRT1 signaling pathway and, probably, through the induction of autophagy.
  OPCs: oligodendrocyte progenitor cells; OLs: oligodendrocytes; CBP: CREB-binding
  protein; mTORC: mammalian target of rapamycin complex; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor; TrkB: tropomyosin receptor kinase B; SIRT1: sirtuin 1. Created with BioRender.com
