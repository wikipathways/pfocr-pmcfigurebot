figure_title: KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analysis of DEPs.
caption: KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analysis of DEPs. KEGG signaling pathway
  enrichment analysis was performed on DEPs to elucidate the potential impact of 1-PHE
  on signaling pathways within LX-2 cells. Notably, Parkinsonâ€™s disease emerged as
  the most significantly enriched pathway associated with upregulated DEPs (A). In
  contrast, the renin secretion signaling pathway demonstrated the strongest enrichment
  among downregulated proteins (B). Intriguingly, the Wnt signaling pathway, a pathway
  strongly implicated in liver fibrosis and HSC activation, was also found to be downregulated
  (C). Downregulated genes were indicated by the color blue, while other genes within
  the pathway were represented by green. LRP5, LDL-receptor-related protein 5; PRKACA,
  protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha
