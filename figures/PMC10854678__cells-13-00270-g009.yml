caption: Arf6 signaling pathway, the inhibitors used in this study, and a model of
  MuLV Gag release. Some effector molecules in the Arf6 signaling pathway are shown
  with the inhibitors used in the study. The blue arrows depict the trafficking of
  MuLV Gag in the model. The solid and broken arrows show the virus release pathways
  under the controlled (solid) and overactivated (broken) Arf6 conditions. PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, ULK, Unc51-like kinase
