figure_title: Changes in miR-107 and NSG1 affected the tumor cell phenotype through
  the ERK pathway.
caption: 'Changes in miR-107 and NSG1 affected the tumor cell phenotype through the
  ERK pathway. (A) Western blot was used to detect the expressions of ERK and P-ERK
  in the transfected cells. (B) Western blot was used to detect the expressions of
  ERK, P-ERK, and NSG1 in the cells after the addition of the ERK agonists. (C) Flow
  cytometry was used to detect the effects of the ERK agonists on cell apoptosis.
  Red means more cells; blue means fewer cells. (D) We evaluated the invasive ability
  of cells after adding the ERK agonists through Transwell experiments. (E) We measured
  the proliferation of cells within 5 days after the addition of the ERK pathway agonists
  using the CCK-8 method. The data from three independent experiments are expressed
  as mean ± standard deviation. NC group: blank control group; ERK-OE group: added
  H-Ile Lys Val Ala Val OH group. Other groups’ meanings are the same as in the above
  chart. ns indicates no statistical significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
  < 0.001'
