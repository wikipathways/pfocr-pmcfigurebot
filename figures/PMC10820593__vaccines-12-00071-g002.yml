caption: Conventional vaccine mechanism and DNA vaccine mechanism. Conventional vaccines
  (on the left) including peptide, subunit, live and attenuated viruses and toxins
  require endocytosis and intracellular processing of the pathogen. Because the pathogen
  is exogenous to the presenting cell, it is processed through the MHC II pathway,
  which preferentially engages CD4+ cells. DNA vaccine (on the right) can be endocytosed
  or can be engineered to passively cross the phospholipid membrane. The nucleic acid
  then locates to the nucleus and transcription and translation occur as if the DNA
  were native, which leads to presentation of the peptide through the MHC I pathway,
  preferentially activating CD8+ cells, additionally, the same peptide is exocytosed
  and then taken up by nearby cells, which then present the peptide via the MHC II
  pathway. Adapted from “COVID-19 DNA-Based Vaccine”, by BioRender.com (2023). Retrieved
