  gray).
caption: 'RT-qPCR results for the control (dark gray) and the Index case (light gray).
  BioRad’s iQ5 Optical System software was used to obtain these values, with the 18S
  gene used as a housekeeping gene to normalize the results. The β-Actin levels were
  altered and therefore could not be used as a housekeeping gene (A). Differential
  expression of genes involved in endothelial functions (A,B), mesenchymal identity,
  or involved in mesenchymal transition (C), as well as genes of the canonical TGF-β
  signaling pathway, were observed (D). Error bars denote ± SEM. Student’s t-test.
  Statistical differences are marked with asterisks: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; ***
  p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001'
