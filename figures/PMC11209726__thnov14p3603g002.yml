caption: 'Impact of Metformin treatment on LF-IPF: a scRNA-seq analysis. (A-B) UMAP
  integrating vehicle and Metformin treated LF-IPF for the 2 independent samples considered.
  Please note that the expression of COL1A1 and PLIN2 is drastically decreased and
  increased by Metformin treatment, respectively. (C) Correlation of the Metformin
  response in the LF-IPF. The log2 Fold change (Metformin/Vehicle) for each gene is
  plotted. Brown dots correspond to genes significantly modulated in both LF-IPF#5
  and LF-IPF#6. Green and red dots correspond to genes significantly modulated in
  either LF-IPF#5 and LF-IPF#6, respectively. Venn diagram shows the genes modulated
  by Metformin in the 2 LF-IPF. (D) Heatmap integrating the 4 samples showing the
  main gene markers for each condition. (E-F) Functions and pathway enrichment analysis
  on differentially regulated genes between Metformin and Control. GOBP: Gene Ontology
  Biological Processes; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathways.'
