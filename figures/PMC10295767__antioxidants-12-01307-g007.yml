caption: The schematic diagram for the protective effect of 3-BDB induced by PM2.5
  was exhibited. 3-BDB inhibited ROS generation induced by PM2.5, which caused macromolecular
  damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In addition, 3-BDB inhibited inflammatory
  cytokines release and MMPs expression through the MAPK signaling pathway, thus alleviating
  cell senescence through a complex intracellular mechanism
