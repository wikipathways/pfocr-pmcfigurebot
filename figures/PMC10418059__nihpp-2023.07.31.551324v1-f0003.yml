figure_title: TORC1 pathway manipulations alter underlying stable MT signal
caption: (A) Heat map showing percent change from control in acetylated α-tubulin
  and Futsch levels for each genetic manipulation. Each experimental condition was
  compared to WT control and appropriate statistical comparisons were performed (detailed
  in ). (B) Representative reconstructions of branches from WT and TORC1 genetic manipulations
  – normalized mCherry::Jupiter fluorescence is coded with the rainbow spectrum shown
  (A.U.). Scaled axes are provided in μm. (C) Heat map representing the average normalized,
  binned mCherry::Jupiter fluorescence along dendrites at increasing distances from
  the soma for each genotype. TORC1 inhibitions are marked in purple and TORC1 activations
  in green. Genotypes found to be significantly different along the dendritic arbor
  are marked with an asterisk. In all panels * = p < 0.05, see  for detailed statistics.
article_title: CCT and Cullin1 regulate the TORC1 pathway to promote dendritic arborization
  in health and disease.
