caption: The expression matrix of 27 candidate genes in the p53 signaling pathway
  in GC tissue samples was classified. (a) The clustering situation of the samples
  when k = 2. (b) Changes of CDF curve when k = 2–5. (c) Relative change of area under
  CDF curve when k = 2–5. (d) PCA analysis of differential gene expression profiles.
  Red dots represent cluster 1, and green dots represent cluster 2
