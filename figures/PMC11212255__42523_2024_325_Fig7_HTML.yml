caption: 'A Classification of measured metabolites according to chemical class in
  serum using 1H-NMR. B partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score
  plot of serum. C abundance of lipids and D amino acids. E metabolic pathway mapping
  of common quantified metabolites in the serum. F abundance of serum metabolites
  and liver enzymes using UV spectroscopy and colorimetry method. Selected metabolites
  obtained from 1H-NMR met the criteria of P < 0.1 and VIP score ≥ 1.5. CON, without
  PEO; PEO, Pinus koraiensis cone essential oil; ALT/SGPT, alanine transaminase/serum
  glutamic pyruvate transaminase; AST/SGOT, aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic
  oxaloacetic transaminase; BUN: blood urea nitrogen. *P < 0.1, **P < 0.05'
