caption: 'Protective effects of CBD on cellular oxidative stress. (A) Fluorescence
  images for the detection of DCF_DA and (B) quantification. (C) Detection of DHE
  using fluorescence images and (D) quantification analysis. (E) Intracellular ROS
  levels and (F) MDA contents from protein lysates. Images were captured by a fluorescence
  filter equipped with microscopy conditions (200×). Data are expressed as mean ±
  S.E.M (n = 4 to 6 for each group). ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 vs. normal group;
  **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 vs. H2O2 group.'
