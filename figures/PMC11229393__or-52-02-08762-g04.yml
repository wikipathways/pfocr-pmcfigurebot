caption: ST6GAL1 overexpression counteracts the signaling pathway involved in the
  DT-mediated effects in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells. (A and B) Western
  blots showing the protein profiles of ST6GAL1, Bcl-2, total STAT3, p-STAT3, total
  P38, p-P38, total NF-κB and p-NF-κB in HCCC9810 cells treated with DT. (C and D)
  Western blots showing the protein profiles of ST6GAL1, Bcl-2, total Akt, p-Akt,
  total P38, p-P38, total NF-κB and p-NF-κB in HuCCT1 cells treated with DT. (E and
  F) Flow cytometry was used to assess the levels of α2,6-sialylation in the different
  treatment groups. ST6GAL1, ST6 β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1; DT, digitoxin;
  p, phosphorylated
