figure_title: CD3D was identified as a hub gene and emerged as a protective factor
  in CC.
caption: 'CD3D was identified as a hub gene and emerged as a protective factor in
  CC. (A) Venn plot showing six genes in the intersection analysis of differentially
  expressed NGRs, CD8 Pathway and prognostic-related genes. (B) Volcano plot for differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs). The green and purple dots represented the significantly
  downregulated and upregulated genes, respectively. FDR < 0.05, |log2 FC|> 1, and
  p < 0.05. (C) Heatmap showing the expression of six intersected genes in low necroptosis
  and high necroptosis clusters. (D) Distribution of gene expression in stage, by
  Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (p-Value: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p <0.05, ns
  p > 0.05). (E) Distribution of gene expression in T classification, by Kruskal-Wallis
  rank sum test (p-Value: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p <0.05, ns p > 0.05). (F)
  Distribution of gene expression in M classification, by Kruskal-Wallis rank sum
  test (p-Value: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p <0.05, ns p > 0.05). (G) The correlation
  of gene expression with primary therapy response, by Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test
  (p-Value: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p <0.05, ns p > 0.05)'
