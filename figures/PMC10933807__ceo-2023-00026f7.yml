caption: Correlation analysis of chemokines and chemokine receptors. (A) Correlation
  analysis of chemokines and chemokine receptors. The expression of SEMA6B, CXCL3,
  PF4, PROK2, and FPR1 in the high-pathomics score (PS) group was significantly higher
  than that in the low-PS group (P<0.001). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. (B) In the
  Hallmark gene set, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis enrichment analysis showed the differential
  genes in the high PS expression group were significantly enriched in DNA repair
  and G2M checkpoint pathways. The differential genes in the low PS expression group
  were significantly enriched in Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS)
  and inflammatory response pathways. (C) The differential genes in the high PS expression
  group were significantly enriched in cell cycle signaling pathways. The differential
  genes in the low PS expression group were significantly enriched in signal pathways
  such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and leukocyte transendothelial migration
  pathways
