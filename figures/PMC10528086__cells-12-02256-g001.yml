caption: The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of Wnt
  signaling, an intracellular complex organized around the scaffold Axin binds APC,
  CK1α, GSK-3, and β-catenin. CK1α phosphorylates β-catenin at a “priming” site that
  then engages GSK-3, which phosphorylates a series of adjacent serines and threonines.
  Phosphorylated β-catenin is then ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteosome. As
  a result, Wnt target genes are repressed by a nuclear complex that includes TCF
  transcription factors and Grg/TLE co-repressors. (B) Wnt protein binding to the
  cysteine rich domain (CRD) of Frizzled proteins (7-pass integral membrane receptors)
  and LRP5/6 co-receptors (single pass) triggers phosphorylation of the C terminal
  domain of LRP5/6 by GSK-3 and CK1. Phosphorylated LRP5/6 recruits the Axin complex
  to the inner face of the cell membrane. At the same time, APC dissociates from the
  complex. These early steps in signaling cause GSK-3 inhibition and β-catenin stabilization.
  Accumulated β-catenin enters the nucleus, displaces the Grg/TLE co-repressor, and
  activates Wnt target gene transcription. (Diagrams made with BioRender).
