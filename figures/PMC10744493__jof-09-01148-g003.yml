figure_title: Membrane sterol composition of evolved strains with and without antifungal
  treatment.
caption: 'Membrane sterol composition of evolved strains with and without antifungal
  treatment. (A) Sterol compositions of 0381-derived strains and the clinical isolate
  were measured by LC-MS (liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry); (B) Sterol compositions
  of 0387-derived strains and the clinical isolate were measured by LC-MS; (C) Changes
  in membrane sterol composition of 0381-derived strains and the clinical isolate
  followed by antifungal treatment (half load of the MIC value reached as a result
  of the microevolution experiment [FLU: 256 µg/mL; POS: 16 µg/mL; VOR: 16 µg/mL]);
  (D) Changes in membrane sterol composition of 0387-derived strains and the clinical
  isolate followed by antifungal treatment (FLU: 256 ug/mL; POS: 16 ug/mL; VOR: 16
  ug/mL); (E) Simplified schematic visualization of the predicted ergosterol biosynthetic
  pathway in C. auris. Color of circles corresponds with the color scheme used in
  sterol composition graphs; (F) Prediction of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway
  in C. auris clinical isolates and both FLUevo and VORevo strains. (G) Altered biosynthetic
  pathway marked with the depletion or complete absence of ergosterol was noted in
  the case of 0381 POSevo and 0387 POSevo and VORevo strains; (H) Following treatment
  with the utilized triazoles, clinical isolates (C. auris 0381 and 0387), 0381 FLUevo,
  0381 POSevo, 0381 VORevo, and 0387 FLUevo showed a depletion of ergosterol content,
  accumulation of lanosterol/obtusifoliol, 14-Me-fecosterol, and the presence of toxic
  byproduct 14-Me-ergosta-dien-diol; (I) After treatment with posaconazole and voriconazole,
  respectively, 0387 POSevo and 0387 VORevo showed complete absence of ergosterol
  accompanied by depletion of 14-Me-ergosta-dien-diol, suggesting premature arrest
  of alternative pathway'
