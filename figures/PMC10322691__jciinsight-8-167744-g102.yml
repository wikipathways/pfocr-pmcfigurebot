figure_title: Epigenetic dysregulation in BOS patient–derived fibroblasts drives transcriptomic
  dysregulation
caption: (A) ATAC-seq heatmap of all significant DEGs with Padj < 0.05 and abs(log2FC)
  ≥ 0.58 between BOS (blue, n = 7) and control (pink, n = 7) fibroblasts found 4336
  DEGs in fibroblasts, with 3036 of 4336 (70.0%) being more upregulated. (B) Gene
  set enrichment showed key dysregulated pathways, including nervous system development.
  (C) Integration of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, x axis) and gene expression
  (RNA-seq, y axis) in BOS patient (n = 7) compared with control fibroblasts (n =
  7) identified a positive correlation (R2 = 0.405) between chromatin accessibility
  and gene expression. We identified a set of 37 common dysregulated transcripts (right).
  DEGs were considered significant (red) for abs(log2FC) ≥ 0.58 and Padj > 0.05
