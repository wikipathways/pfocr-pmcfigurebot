figure_title: SPV regulated the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in the livers of mice
  fed a high-fat diet.
caption: 'SPV regulated the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in the livers of mice fed
  a high-fat diet. (A) SPV treatment resulted in reduced levels of TLR4, MyD88, and
  TRAF6 expression, and the phosphorylation levels of IKK α+β, IκBα, and NF-κB. (B)
  SPV treatment resulted in reduced expression level of PP2A and the phosphorylation
  level of PKC. (C) SPV treatment resulted in reduced expression levels of NLRP3,
  caspase 1, and IL-1β. Quantification data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or the corresponding total protein concentration and expressed
  as the percentage of the vehicle-treated NCD-fed mice. The data are shown as the
  mean ± SD (n = 3). ## p < 0.01 and ### p < 0.001 versus the vehicle-treated NCD-fed
  mice; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus the vehicle-treated HFD-fed
  mice'
