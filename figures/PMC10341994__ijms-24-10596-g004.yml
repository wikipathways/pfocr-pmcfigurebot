  exposure.
caption: 'Activation of Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway in MH-S cells induced by rLLB
  exposure. (a) qPCR analysis of Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway-related molecules Akt,
  p105, and p65 expression at 12 h, 24 h, and 36 h in the NC and rLLB groups. (b)
  WB analysis of p-Akt, Akt, p-p105, p105, p-p65, and p65 expression at 12 h, 24 h,
  and 36 h in the NC and rLLB groups at the protein level. (c) Quantification of the
  grayscale value of (b). (d) Inhibition rate of MH-S cell growth induced by treatment
  with 1 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, 20 μM, 40 μM, 60 μM, 80 μM, 150 μM, and 200 μM GDC-0068
  for 12 h by CCK-8 assay. (e) WB analysis of p-Akt expression at different concentrations
  of GDC-0068 (1 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, 25 μM, and 50 μM) for 12 h. (f) WB analysis of the
  effect of adding 10 μM GDC-0068 on p-Akt, Akt, p-p105, p105, p-p65, and p65 expression
  in MH-S cells at 24 h. (g,h) Quantification of the grayscale values of (f). (i,k,m)
  Immunofluorescence analysis of the expression of p-Akt, p-p50, and p-p65 in four
  groups at 24 h. (j,l,n) Quantification of MFI in (i,k,m), respectively. (o) WB analysis
  of the effect of adding 20 μM PDTC on the expression of p-p105, p105, p-p65, and
  p65 at 24 h. (p) Quantification of the grayscale values of (o). Data are presented
  as the means ± SD (n = 3). The NC groups at different time points in (a,c) are normalized
  to 1, respectively. (a,c) Using two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons
  tests. (g,h,j,l,n,p) Using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  tests. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns: no significance'
