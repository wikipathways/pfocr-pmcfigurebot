caption: Overview of cell death pathways modulated by Mtb through their virulence
  factors. Mtb can use its various virulence factors as inductors (red arrows) or
  inhibitors (black inhibitors) of diverse cell death mechanisms to orchestrate the
  infection process; as well, it allows it to disseminate and replicate for its survival
