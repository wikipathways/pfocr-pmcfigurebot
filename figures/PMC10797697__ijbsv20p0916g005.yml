figure_title: Identification of YTHDF3-regulates genes by RNA-seq, RIP-seq, and MeRIP-seq.
caption: Identification of YTHDF3-regulates genes by RNA-seq, RIP-seq, and MeRIP-seq.
  (A) Flow chart of the screening and validation of the correlation between the expression
  of YTHDF3 and that of its downstream target LRP6. (B) Percentages and metagene profiles
  of RNA species by m6A modifications in 5' untranslated regions, coding sequences,
  stop codon, and 3' untranslated region. (C) The m6A motif was detected by MEME motif
  analysis of the MeRIP-seq. (D) The upregulated of m6A-associated genes enriched
  the Wnt signaling pathway and Hippo signaling pathway through KEGG analysis of MeRIP-seq
  (SiHa and H8 cell lines). (E) Distribution of YTHDF3 bound with mRNA was identified
  by RIP-seq. (F) Gene set enrichment analysis plots (GSEA) of RNA-seq revealed that
  the DEGs were enriched in the Wnt signalling and VEGF signalling pathways. (G) KEGG
  analysis of RIP-seq displayed that the YTHDF3- bound genes were enriched in the
  Wnt signalling and VEGF signalling pathways. (H) Overlapping analysis of genes identified
  by MeRIP-seq, RIP-seq, and RNA-seq. (I) IGV software was utilized to show the peaks
  with m6A enrichment in SiHa and H8 cell lines. The y-axis shows normalized reads
  distribution for input (black) and m6A IP (orange or green). (J) IGV image of RIP-seq
  was used to display the binding region of YTHDF3-LRP6. The y-axis shows normalized
  reads distribution for input (black) and IP (orange or green)
