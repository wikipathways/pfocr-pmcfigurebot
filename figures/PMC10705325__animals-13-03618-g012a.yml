caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of genes. The horizontal axis represents the enrichment
  coefficient, and the vertical axis represents the name of the pathway. The figure
  presents all the DEGs, the upregulated genes, and the top 10 signal pathways of
  the downregulated genes induced by different OA concentrations
