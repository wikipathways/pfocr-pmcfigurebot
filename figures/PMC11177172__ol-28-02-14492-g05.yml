figure_title: The eIF2 signaling pathway and phosphorylation of eIF2α in hCBR1-tGFP-overexpressing
  OVCAR-3 cells.
caption: 'The eIF2 signaling pathway and phosphorylation of eIF2α in hCBR1-tGFP-overexpressing
  OVCAR-3 cells. (A) Schematic diagram of the eIF2 signaling pathway. Four kinases
  of eIF2α have been identified in humans: GCN2, PKR, HRI, and PERK. Phosphorylation
  of eIF2α leads to apoptosis and autophagy via ASNS or CHOP. (B-a) Immunoblot analysis
  to detect phosphorylation of the eIF2α protein. (B-b) The detected bands were quantified
  using ImageJ. The ratio of the band intensity (i.e., p-eIF2α: eIF2α) is shown. *P<0.05.
  (C-a) Immunoblot analysis of ATF-4 protein expression. (C-b) The ratio of the band
  intensity (i.e., ATF-4: β-actin) is shown. n.s., not significant. Each antibody
  reaction was performed on each membrane. eIF2, eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 2; hCBR1, human carbonyl reductase 1; tGFP, turbo green fluorescent protein;
  GCN2, general control nonderepressible-2; PKR, protein kinase R; HRI, heme-regulated
  inhibitor; PERK, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; ASNS, aspartate
  synthetase; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; p-eIF2, phosphorylated-eIF2; ATF-4,
  activating transcription factor 4'
