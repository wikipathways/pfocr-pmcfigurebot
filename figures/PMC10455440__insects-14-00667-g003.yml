figure_title: Gene expression profiles of (A) Toll, (B) Imd, and (C) JNK immune signaling
  pathways in T.
caption: Gene expression profiles of (A) Toll, (B) Imd, and (C) JNK immune signaling
  pathways in T. ni infected with either B. bassiana or C. javanica, evaluated at
  2 days post-infection (sample size = 13 larvae/treatment). Each dot represents a
  single larva, with horizontal lines representing mean expression with 95% confidence
  intervals. * p < 0.05; ns = not significant
