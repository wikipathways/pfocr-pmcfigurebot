caption: '(A) Schematic overview of metabolic reactions in recombinant indole producing
  C. glutamicum. Single reactions are shown as continuous arrows, while dashed arrows
  indicate multiple reactions. Genes depicted in green indicate genome-based overexpression
  unless indicated by #, which indicates vector-based expression. Gene deletions are
  visualized in gray. PTS, phosphotransferase system; IolT1, myo-inositol facilitator;
  iolR, IolT1 transcriptional regulator; glk, glucokinase; ppgk, polyphosphate glucokinase;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; tkt, transketolase; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; ppc, PEP carboxylase; ldhA, lactate dehydrogenase; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid; DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate; aroF, DAHP
  synthase; aroGEcD146N, feedback-resistant DAHP synthase from E. coli; csm, chorismate
  mutase, trpEEcS40F, feedback-resistant anthranilate synthase from E. coli; trpECgS38R,
  feedback-resistant anthranilate synthase from C. glutamicum; trpG, anthranilate
  synthase component I; l-Gln, l-glutamine; l-Glu, l-glutamate; glnA, glutamine synthetase
  I; yggB, MscS-type mechanosensitive channel; trpD, anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase;
  trpDEc, TrpD from E. coli; trpFC, N-(5′-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase; IGP,
  indole-3-glycerol phosphate; trpBA, tryptophan synthase; IGL, IGP lyase; trpA, tryptophan
  synthase α-subunit. (B) Scheme of the IGP lyase reaction. In a retroaldol cleavage
  reaction, IGP is converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and indole.'
