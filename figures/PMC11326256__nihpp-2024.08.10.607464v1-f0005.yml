figure_title: Differential gene expression in mutant organoids defined by bulk RNAseq
  and scRNAseq
caption: (A) Integrated UMAP plot of 3-month cultured RTT-R306C cerebral organoid
  and isogenic control, identifying the cell types of organoids. (B) Differential
  gene expression in brain organoids carrying MeCP2[R306C] mutation, identifying HDAC2
  overexpression in the mutant organoids. RNA was extracted and pooled from 8 different
  3-month organoids in each condition for bulk RNAseq. The volcano plot shows 343
  upregulated and 107 downregulated genes from bulk RNAseq. (C) HDAC2 expression after
  classifying cell types with scRNAseq. Altered HDAC2 gene expression was observed
  in all neural cells including excitatory and inhibitory neurons, radial glia, and
  astrocytes. (D) Neuron-neuron connectivity inferred by NeuronChatDB in R306C mutant
  and control organoids. (E) Quantification of differential inferred neuron-neuron
  interaction. (F) Significant downregulated/upregulated signaling pathway among cell
  types. Downregulated neurexin-neuroglin and Glu-GluR interactions were observed
  in the R306C mutant organoids. (G) Integrated UMAP plot of 3-month cultured RTT-V247X
  cerebral organoid and isogenic control. (H) Differential gene expression in brain
  organoids carrying MeCP2[V247X] mutation, identifying downregulation of GABAergic
  receptors in mutant organoids. RNA was extracted and pooled from 6 different organoids
  in each condition for bulk RNAseq. The volcano plot shows 896 upregulated and 494
  downregulated genes. (I) GABRA4 and GABRA2 expression in different cell types; downregulation
  was observed in excitatory but not in inhibitory neurons. (J) Inferred neuron-neuron
  connectivity determined by NeuronChatDB in RTT-V247X mutant and control organoids.
  (K) Quantification of differential inferred neuron-neuron interaction. Downregulated
  neurexin-neuroglin and GABA-GABRA4 interactions were observed in the RTT-V247X mutant
  organoids. (L) Inferred connectivity analysis showing loss of GABA->GABAR4 directional
  interaction between excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons, due to the downregulation
  of GABARA4 in excitatory neurons. (M, N, O) Drug treatment (CAY10683 (HDAC2 inhibitor)
  and Baclofen) for 72 hrs for cerebral organoids, showing (N) spike frequency and
  O) small world propensity in the presence of drugs. n = 3 organoids per condition.
