caption: A comparison of metabolite variations between potato varieties (day 0) and
  treatments (day 2) through Venn diagram and pathway analysis. (D,H) Venn diagram
  demonstrating the common and exclusive differentially metabolized compounds within
  the comparison groups. (A–C,E–G) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis based on the metabolite
  distinctions between the two comparison groups. Each bubble represents a metabolic
  pathway. The ordinate and bubble size jointly indicate the influencing factors of
  the pathway. A larger impact factor and the p-values of the enrichment analysis
  are denoted by a larger bubble size and bubble color, respectively. The deeper colors
  signify greater enrichment levels. I, intact potato tuber; W, injured potato tuber;
  D and L, potato tubers stored in darkness and light, respectively
