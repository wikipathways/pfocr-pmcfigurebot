figure_title: Effusanin B regulated the STAT3 signaling pathway.
caption: Effusanin B regulated the STAT3 signaling pathway. (A) Western blotting analysis
  was conducted to evaluate the effects of effusanin B on the expression of STAT3
  and p-STAT3. (B) Histogram showing the relative expression level of the protein
  compared with the control group. The results are expressed as means Â± SD. *** p
  < 0.001 versus the control group
