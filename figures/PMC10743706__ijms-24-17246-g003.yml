caption: BRs control the plant development–stress response equilibrium. Depending
  on cellular and environmental settings, interactions between BR and stress signaling
  pathways can occur through their receptors, downstream kinases (such as BIN2), and/or
  transcription factors (such as BZR1/BES1). This figure was drawn using BioRender
