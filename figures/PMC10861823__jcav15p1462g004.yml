  pathway.
caption: 'Downregulation of CD206 downregulate the human TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (A) Abundance of IL10, CCL17, CCL22, MMP2 and MMP9 mRNA in T-M2 and HS1-transfected
  T-M2 cells quantified by RT-qPCR (* indicates statistical significance vs NC, *:
  P<0.05, **: P<0.005, ***: P<0.001) (n =3). (B) Supernatant from T-M2 cells was collected
  to measure the abundance of secreted IL10, CCL17, CCL22, MMP2 and MMP9 by ELISA.
  T-M2 cells were transfected with HS1 or NC siRNA for 48 h (* indicates statistical
  significance vs NC, *: P<0.05, ***: P<0.001) (n =3). (C-D) Representative Western
  blots (C) and their quantification (D) for TLR4, MyD88 and p-P65/P65 abundance in
  T-M2 cells transfected with HS1 or NC siRNA for 48 h. TLR4 and MyD88 were normalized
  against actin, p-P65 were normalized against total P65 (* indicates statistical
  significance vs T-M2NC, P<0.05; # indicates statistical significance vs T-M2, *:
  P<0.05, **: P<0.005; # indicates statistical significance vs T-M2, #: P<0.05, ##:
