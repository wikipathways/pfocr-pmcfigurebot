caption: Effect of AT-II combined with IFN-γ on cytokine profiling in peripheral blood
  of lung metastatic C57BL/6 mice. The levels of (A) IL-1α, (B) IL-1β, (C) IL-2, (D)
  IL-6, (E) IL-10, (F) IL-12 (p40), (G) IL-17, (H) Eotaxin, (I) KC, (J) MCP-1, (K)
  MIP-1β, and (L) TNF-α in the serum samples from lung metastatic C57BL/6 mice were
  measured by using ELISA. Data were represented as mean±SD. ▲P<0.05, ▲▲P<0.01, vs.
  model group. **P<0.01, vs. IFN-γ and AT-II groups.
article_title: Atractylenolide II combined with Interferon-γ synergistically ameliorates
  colorectal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro by blocking the NF-kB p65/PD-L1
  pathway.
