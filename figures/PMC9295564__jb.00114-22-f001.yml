caption: Screening assay for the search of genes affecting oxylipin production. (A)
  Oxylipins biosynthetic pathway of P. aeruginosa. The enzyme 10(S)-dioxygenase (OdsA)
  transforms host OA into 10S-hydroperoxide-octadecenoic acid (10S-HPOME) by stereospecific
  oxygenation at position C-10 of the OA alkyl chain. Subsequently, 10S-HPOME could
  be isomerized by the enzyme (7S,10S)-hydroperoxide isomerase to form 7S,10S-DiHOME
  or be reduced to 10-HOME by an undefined mechanism. (B) Picture showing the WT phenotype
  of P. aeruginosa versus that of the Δds deletion mutant when plated on LB agar +
  OA (1%). (C) Representative picture of a plate section of our transposon screening
  showing a colony lacking the halo.
