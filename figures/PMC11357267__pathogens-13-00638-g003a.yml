caption: Pathways altered in chickens vaccinated with GII. The pathways are overlaid
  with the Molecule Activity Predictor (MAP) feature to recognize the unknown molecules.
  Green and red shapes represent down- and up-regulation. The orange and blue shapes
  represent predicted molecule activation and inhibition, respectively. (a) Unfolded
  Protein Response (UPR) pathway. (b) Leukocyte extravasation signaling
