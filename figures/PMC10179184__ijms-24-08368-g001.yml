caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanism through which IKK and CYLD phosphorylation
  mediates the activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, subsequently inducing oxidative
  stress in human kidney cells. IKK activates CYLD phosphorylation, which in turn
  inactivates CYLDâ€™s deubiquitination activity. This promotes the ubiquitination of
  Nrf2, resulting in Nrf2 protein degradation and inhibition of the Nrf2/ARE signaling
  pathway. Consequently, oxidative stress is exacerbated in ORN-associated kidney
  injury
