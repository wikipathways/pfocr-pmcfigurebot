  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling as candidate therapeutic targets for iMCD-1.
caption: Serum proteomics and pathway analyses identify VEGF-A, sIL-2Rα, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling as candidate therapeutic targets for iMCD-1. (A) Heatmap of the analytes
  whose levels increase (blue) or decrease (orange) by at least 2-fold in the same
  direction between flare and remission for iMCD-1’s third and fifth flares, as measured
  by Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP (n = 1). Analytes are presented in ascending order from
  left to right based on the log2 (flare/remission) fold-change at the fifth flare,
  compared with remission. Key provides the color intensity for a given fold-change.
  (B,C) Enrichment analysis, using Enrichr, of Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP gene sets for
  metabolic pathways for iMCD-1. Results of the top five enriched gene sets (FDR <
  0.01, rank ordered by combined score) from the (B) third flare and (C) fifth flare
  when proteins with log2 (flare/remission) greater than two were analyzed for KEGG
  pathway gene sets. Colored cells represent gene members in specific pathways that
  were found to be greater than 4-fold up (blue) or 4-fold down (orange) during flare
  compared with remission. Reproduced with permission from Fajgenbaum D.C., Langan
