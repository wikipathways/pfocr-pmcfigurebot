caption: 'Contribution of miRs/target genes involved in the innate immune and inflammatory
  response pathway in the spleen in Lagovirus europaeus infection. In the spleen,
  the miR-155 expression increases during L. europaeus/GI.1 and GI.2 genotypes’ infections
  inhibit MyD88 and p65 (MyD88—Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.81, p = 0.004,
  p65—Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.98, p < 0.001 for GI.1 and MyD88—Spearman’s
  rank correlation Rho: −0.81, p = 0.004, p65—Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.91,
  p < 0.001 for GI.2). Decreased expression of miR-223 correlates with upregulated
  expression level of NLRP3 (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.95, p < 0.001 for
  GI.1). ?—Requires further research'
