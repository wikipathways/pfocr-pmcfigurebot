figure_title: Main anti-inflammatory properties of HDLs.
caption: Main anti-inflammatory properties of HDLs. “↗” means “increase”. Several
  mediators promote the inflammatory NF-κB pathway in vascular cells, including endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress, TNF-α, AGEs, ROS, and modified LDLs. This results in an elevated
  gene expression of adhesion molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and NADPH oxidase
  (NOX2). (1) Healthy HDLs bind to S1P receptors (S1PR), SR-BI, ABCA1 and ABCG1. (2)
  HDL-mediated protection of LDLs against oxidation counteracts the activating effect
  of oxidized LDLs on NF-κB pathway through the binding to the LOX-1 receptor. (3)
  HDLs dampen ROS production. (4) The activation of endothelial NO synthase by HDLs
  leads to the inhibiting nitrosylation of NF-κB. (5) Ultimately, HDLs have the capacity
  to impede the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, (6) subsequently suppressing
  the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. (7) Such
  transcriptional effects inhibit the recruitment of immune cells into the subendothelial
  space. The figure was partly created utilizing Servier Medical Art (Creative Commons
