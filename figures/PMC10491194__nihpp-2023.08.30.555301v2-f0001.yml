caption: Proposed RF pathway in mycobacteria. (A) Genomic context of RF pathway genes
  in Msm and Mtb. Homologs are shown in the same colour. (B) The proposed RF pathway
  in mycobacteria inferred from B. subtilis. Step 1. The bifunctional GTP cyclohydrolase
  II/ DHBP synthase, RibA2 catalyzes the first steps of the pathway by converting
  two molecules of ribulose-5-P, emanating from purine metabolism (solid black arrows)
  and one GTP molecule derived from the pentose phosphate route (dashed black arrows),
  to their respective products, 3,4-dihydroxyl-2-butanone 4-phosphate (3,4-DHBP) and
  2,5-diamino-6-(5-phospho-D-ribosylamino)-pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (DARP) (18). Steps
  2 and 3. DARP is deaminated by the bifunctional RF deaminase/ 5-amino-6-(5-phosphoribosylamino)
  uracil reductase RibG to 5-amino-6-(5â€™-phospho-ribitylamino)-uracil (ARPP) and dephosphorylated
  by an unknown phosphatase to produce 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-A-RU). Step
  4. The products from the two pathways, 3,4-DHBP and 5-A-RU converge and are condensed
  by lumazine synthase, RibH, yielding 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (DMRL). Step
  5. The RF synthase, RibC, through a dismutation reaction, converts two molecules
  of DMRL to RF and 5-A-RU (which feeds back into the cycle). Step 6. RF is converted
  to FMN and FAD through by the bifunctional kinase/ FAD synthetase, RibF (). Step
  7. Through distinct enzymatic reactions mediated by FbiC, FbiB and FbiA, 5-A-RU
  can also be converted to F420 (). DMRL and its derivatives can act as MAIT cell
  activators. Additionally, 5-A-RU also has the capacity to interact with molecules
  from specific pathways to produce MAIT cell modulators (grey dashed line).
