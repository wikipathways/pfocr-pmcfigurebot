figure_title: Association of anticancer drugâ€“targeted pathways with different ACC
  tumor subpopulations
caption: Each black square indicates that the drug pathway is present in a subpopulation.
  The network was generated with the correlated tumor subpopulations. The orange and
  cyan lines indicate positive or negative correlations, respectively, between metabolites
  and subpopulations. The black lines indicate that a metabolite plays a role in an
  anticancer drug pathway. ACC, adrenocortical carcinoma; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  ADP, adenosine diphosphate
