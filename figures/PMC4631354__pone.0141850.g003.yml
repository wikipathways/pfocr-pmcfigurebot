caption: '(A) The major FAs in C. elegans are produced by the elongation and
  desaturation pathway shown here. An alternate pathway downstream of FA synthase
  (fasn-1) is used for the production of monomethyl-branched chain FAs, C15iso
  and C17iso. (B) The amount of new FA incorporated each hour was quantified in
  animals treated with adult-only RNAi against the FA synthesis, elongation and
  desaturation genes for 48 hours. The resulting data are summarized here with species
  with less replenishment than control RNAi colored light blue (>25% decrease) and dark
  blue (>50% decrease). See S1 Dataset for complete source data. (C) To determine the
  overall impact on membrane replenishment, we averaged the replacement rates for each
  FA species and normalized by the abundance of each species in the PL population.
  RNAi of pod-2, fat-5, fat-6 and fat-7 resulted in significant reduction in overall
  membrane maintenance. (D) The relative amount of synthesized FA is reduced with
  fat-7 RNAi treatment (blue) compared to control RNAi (black). Numbers shown
  represent the mean of at least three experiments Â± SEM. Statistical significance
  was determined by two-tailed unpaired t-tests (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001).'
