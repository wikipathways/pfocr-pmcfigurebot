caption: Expression analysis of genes involved in PI3-AKT-mTOR pathway post MMTV expression.
  The PI3-AKT-mTOR pathway was downloaded from the KEGG mouse pathways and was modified
  accordingly. The up-regulated genes are shown in red, while the down-regulated in
  green seemed to down-regulate Akt gene (a key gene of the PI3-AKT-mTOR pathway).
  Down-regulation of Akt could result in induced apoptosis, NFÆ™B, and p53 signaling
  that is also evident from our results, suggesting that MMTV may up-regulate these
  pathways, as suggested by GSEA analysis. This figure was created using KEGG "map04151
  PI3K-Akt signaling pathway [68]" with copyright permission (230722)
