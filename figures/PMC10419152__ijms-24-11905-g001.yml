caption: 'MAPK signaling pathways in mammalian cells: The MAPK signaling pathways
  are mediated by highly conserved MAPKs, which are activated sequentially. The figure
  depicts four canonical pathways organized in four tiers (A–D). Two non-canonical
  (Erk3/4 and Erk7/8) pathways are not shown. Extracellular signals, such as growth
  factors, cytokines, mitogens, and stress (e.g., UV, starvation, etc.), can stimulate
  the pathways by affecting plasma membrane receptors (not illustrated). Upon stimulation,
  the receptors transmit the signal to cytoplasmic proteins, termed ‘activators’ (e.g.,
  the small GTP binding proteins belonging to the Rho and Ras families). These ‘activators’
  then stimulate the downstream MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK), which then activate
  by phosphorylating (P) specific serine/threonine or tyrosine residues present in
  the activation loop of the downstream MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK), which then further
  activate the downstream MAP kinases (MAPK) by phosphorylating identical residues
  in their activation loop. It is worth pointing out that these pathways are interconnected.
  For instance, Tpl2 can signal the Erk1/2 and Erk5/BMK1 pathways. In addition, there
  are MAPK signaling pathways whose final targets are not nuclear, such as the myosin
  light chain kinase (MLCK) functioning downstream of Ras/MEK/Erk. Such pathways are
  not indicated in the figure, although they are affected by bacterial effectors,
  as in the case of Salmonella SteC. The activated MAPKs translocate into the nucleus,
  activating various transcriptional programs, which alter the gene expression, leading
  to diverse cellular responses, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation,
  survival, apoptosis, and innate immune responses, such as proinflammatory responses
  against invading microbial pathogens. The activation of the MAPK and NF-ĸB signaling
  pathways by bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) mediates the
  activation of the Toll-like receptors (TLR)/myeloid differentiation primary response
  88 (Myd88)/TRIF (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor) signaling pathway is depicted (E).
  This pathway typically promotes the activation of transcriptional programs leading
  to proinflammatory responses. Ras—Rat sarcoma; RhoA—Ras homolog family member A;
