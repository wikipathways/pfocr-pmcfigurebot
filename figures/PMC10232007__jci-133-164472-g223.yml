figure_title: miR-21 induces a proinflammatory phenotype and downregulates TGF-β–related
  pathway in macrophages
caption: Peritoneal macrophage (PM) transfection with miR-21 mimic (mimic-21) or scramble
  control (N5) followed by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry. (A) miR-21-5p fold change after
  48 hours of transfection with mimic-21 (n = 6). (B) Spry2 (known target of miR-21-5p)
  mRNA fold change after 48-hour PM transfection (n = 6). (C) Tgfb1 fold change in
  PMs overexpressing miR-21-5p, n = 6 per group. (D) Spearman’s correlation between
  miR-21-5p expression and Tgfb1 mRNA expression (n = 11). (E) RT-qPCR of Tgfbr1,
  Tgfbr2, Tgfbr3, and (F) Smad7 fold change in PMs overexpressing miR-21-5p, n = 6
  per group. (G) Histograms of TGF-βR2 expression in BMDMs transfected with mimic-21
  or scramble N5 by quantitative flow cytometry using fluorescence minus one (FMO)
  controls. The bar graphs represent the MFI (left) and percentage of cells (right),
  n = 4 per group. (H) RT-qPCR of proinflammatory genes Tnfa and Il6 in PMs transfected
  with mimic-21 (n = 6). (I) RT-qPCR of polarization markers Arg1 and Nos2 in PMs
  transfected with mimic-21, n = 5–6 per group. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 by unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s t test (A–C and E–I)
