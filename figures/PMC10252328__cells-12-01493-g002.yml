caption: The effect of FcεRI-mediated signaling pathway in the activation of IRF3.
  Anti-DNP-IgE-sensitized mBMMCs and RBL-2H3 were pre-treated for 1 h with each inhibitor,
  including PP2 (5 µM), LY 294002 (LY, 5 µM), U 73122 (U7, 5 µM), and Akt inhibitor
  IV (Akt in, 1 µM), and then stimulated with DNP-HSA for 5 min for p-S396-IRF3 and
  15 min for N-IRF3. The expression of p-S396-IRF3, IRF3, and lamin B1 in the total
  and nuclear fraction of (A) mBMMCs and (B) RBL-2H3
