  pathway and the main common DLMs in AF vs.
caption: (A,C) Pearson correlation analysis between common DEGs in metabolic pathway
  and the main common DLMs in AF vs. IMF and SF vs. IMF (|r| ≥ 0.6, p ≤ 0.05 and |r|
  ≥ 0.8, p ≤ 0.05). (B,D) Pearson correlation analysis between the top 20 common DEGs
  and the main DLMs in AF vs. IMF and SF vs. IMF (|r| ≥ 0.6, p ≤ 0.05 and |r| ≥ 0.8,
  p ≤ 0.05). (E) Venn diagram of correlation analysis between the two groups (|r|
  ≥ 0.6, p ≤ 0.05)
