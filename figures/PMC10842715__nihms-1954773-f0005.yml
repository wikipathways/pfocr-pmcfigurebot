figure_title: Expression of the genes required for FA synthesis
caption: '(A) FA biosynthetic pathway. Intermediate enzymes, cofactors, and byproducts
  are omitted for simplicity. The chain length (number of carbons) of FAs produced
  by each KAS is in parentheses. ACP, acyl carrier protein.(B) Subunits of heteromeric
  ACC. Note that relative size and position of the subunits are different from reality.
  See text for abbreviations. Numbers refer to isoforms in Arabidopsis.(C) Expression
  levels of plastidic ACC subunits. Total RNA was extracted from 10-DAF seeds of WT,
  lhycca1, and LHY/CCA1-OEs. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with gene-specific
  primers.(D) Expression levels of cytosolic ACC and KAS. The experiments performed
  and data layout are as in (C). Values in (C) and (D) are mean ± SD with individual
  data points and p values < 0.05 on the bar denoting statistical significance determined
  by Student’s t test (to WT; n = 3 groups of seeds).(E) Time-course expression of
  KASIII. The data were generated from a public microarray database (Diurnal; diurnal.mocklerlab.org),
  where WT (Ler) and LHY-OE were grown under 8-h light/16-h dark cycles and are shown
  here as normalized to the level at 0 h. Pearson’s correlation coefficient: WT =0.872,
  LHY-OE = 0.979'
