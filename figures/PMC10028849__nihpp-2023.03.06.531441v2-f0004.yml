figure_title: Evaluating the biological significance of NetFlow3D-identified significantly
  interconnected modules
caption: (a) Enrichment comparison for known cancer genes among well-known cancer
  pathways, NetFlow3D modules, and GO biological processes, with p-values derived
  from two-proportion Z-tests. (b) Examination of mutation patterns within each well-known
  cancer pathway, NetFlow3D module, and GO biological process. The p-values for comparisons
  were obtained using the Mann-Whitney U test. (c) Comparison of mutation patterns
  between entities with versus without known cancer genes. This comparison was only
  applicable to NetFlow3D modules and GO biological processes. (d) Association of
  NetFlow3D-identified potential driver mutations with patientsâ€™ survival. HR stands
  for hazard ratio
