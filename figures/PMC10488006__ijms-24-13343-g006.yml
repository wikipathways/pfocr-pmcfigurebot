caption: Analysis of key regulatory genes in the terpenoid synthesis pathway. (A)
  Gene expression in distinctively colored celery. (B) Key genes and compounds in
  MVA and MEP pathways. (C) Gene expression in distinctive tissues. (D) RT-qPCR analysis
  of gene expression levels in pathway of terpenoid synthesis. Column chart in the
  same color with the expression of the leaf on the left side and the petiole on the
  right side. Each error line represents the mean ± SD (standard deviation), t-test
  with significance level of 0.05 (p < 0.05). The different letters with lowcase (a–e)
  indicate significance differences, the same letter indicating no significance difference
