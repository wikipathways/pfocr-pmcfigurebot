caption: CARM1 is involved in the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  regulated by RBM5. (A) J82 cells were transfected with LV-oeCARM1 or LV-Con, and
  western blotting was performed to examine the protein expression of p-GSK3β, GSK3β,
  and β-catenin. (B) Quantitative analysis of (A). (C) T24 cells were transfected
  with LV−shCARM1 or control lentivirus, after which p-GSK3β, GSK3β, and β-catenin
  protein levels were assessed via western blotting. (D) Quantitative analysis of
  (C). (E) T24 cells were transfected with LV−shRBM5 or LV−shCARM1 alone or in combination;
  afterward, western blotting was performed to detect the protein expression of p-GSK3β,
  GSK3β, and β-catenin. (F) Quantitative analysis of (E). (G) T24 cells were transfected
  with LV-shCARM1 or LV-shCon and then treated with XAV939. The CDK4, p-GSK3β, GSK3β,
  and β-catenin protein levels were measured via western blotting. (H) Quantitative
  analysis of (H). All data were derived from three independent experiments and expressed
  as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <
  0.001 vs. their corresponding controls
