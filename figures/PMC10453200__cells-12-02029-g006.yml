caption: Transcriptome profiling indicates that the genes involved in CM maturation
  and vessel formation are upregulated in H-COs compared with those in L-COs from
  H9 hESCs. (A) Schematic of the transcriptome analysis of H-COs and L-COs on days
  5, 15, and 25. (B) Venn diagram depicting the number of genes upregulated (red)
  and downregulated (black) > 2-fold between H-COs and L-COs on days 5, 15, and 25.
  (C) GO analysis of genes associated with CM maturation and vessel formation upregulated
  in H-COs compared with L-COs on days 5 (white), 15 (pink), and 25 (red). Clustered
  heatmaps of DEGs involved in (D) CM maturation and (E) vessel formation in H-COs
  and L-COs on days 5, 15, and 25. Pathway analysis of genes (F) upregulated in H-COs
  compared with L-COs on days 5 (white), 15 (pink), and 25 (red), and (G) downregulated
  in H-COs compared with L-COs on days 5 (white), 15 (sky blue), and 25 (blue). (H)
  Clustered heatmap of DEGs involved in ECM, integrin, focal adhesion, TGFβ signaling,
  and angiogenesis signaling in H-COs and L-COs on days 5, 15, and 25. (I) Network
  analysis of DEGs associated with CM maturation and vessel formation in H-COs compared
  with those in L-COs. Circles and lines represent genes and protein interactions
  between genes, respectively
