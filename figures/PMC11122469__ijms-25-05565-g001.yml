figure_title: (A) Schematic diagram depicting the mesenchymal–epithelial transition
  factor (c-Met) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathways with
  downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein kinase B (Akt) signalling
  cascades.
caption: (A) Schematic diagram depicting the mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor
  (c-Met) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathways with downstream
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
  and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein kinase B (Akt) signalling cascades.
  Indicated are the binding sites of all small molecule inhibitors used in this study
  and key mutations present in UWG02CTC and AGS cells. (B,C) Representative Western
  blots showing total and phosphorylated protein levels in (B) UWG02CTC and (C) AGS
  cells following overnight serum starvation (1% FCS) compared to cells grown in complete
  growth media (contains epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 10% foetal calf serum (FCS))
  under 2D culture conditions
