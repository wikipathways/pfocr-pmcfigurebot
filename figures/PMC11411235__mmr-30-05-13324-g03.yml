figure_title: Functions of tetraspanins in PC.
caption: 'Functions of tetraspanins in PC. (A) Tetraspanins promoting PC progression:
  (a) LIR-mode mutations in TSPAN1 inhibit autophagy and promote PC cell proliferation.
  miR-454 targets TSPAN1 and FAM83A, promoting PC cell proliferation. miR-573 targets
  TSPAN1 to suppress the growth, movement and infiltration of PC cells. In addition,
  the proliferation and invasion of PC cells can be triggered by integrin α2 and TSPAN1,
  leading to the development of a miR-216a-TSPAN1-integrin α2 axis that has a role
  in controlling the progression of PC. TSPAN1 siRNAs hinder the migration and invasion
  of PC cells and suppress MMP2 mRNA expression, by preventing the translocation and
  phosphorylation of PLCγ. The TSPAN1-FAM110A-HIST1H2BK-G9a pathway plays a role in
  controlling the advancement of PC. (b) TSPAN8 recruits and activates MMP9 and MMP13
  to promote PC cell migration. Under EGF stimulation, TSPAN8 expresses SOX9, which
  positively regulates the endogenous expression of TSPAN8, thereby increasing the
  metastatic and invasive ability of PC cells. (B) Tetraspanins suppressing PC progression:
  (a) TSPAN29/CD9 regulates EGFR, potentially inhibiting PC growth and metastasis.
  (b) TSPAN27/CD82 regulates c-Met expression and downregulates VEGF-C expression,
  inhibiting the HGF and Src/STAT3 signaling pathways respectively, and thus metastasis.
  (c) TSPAN7/CD231 is predicted to be a tumor suppressor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
