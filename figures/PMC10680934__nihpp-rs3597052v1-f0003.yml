caption: 'Panel A: Metabolic pathway analysis for the whole blood TPP concentration
  metabolome-wide association analysis (MWAS) in the 76 critically ill study participants
  upon admission to the ICU. Significant pathways spanned glucose metabolism, amino
  acid and nitrogen metabolism, lipid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, microbiome
  metabolism, and vitamin metabolism, respectively. Specific pathways enriched in
  association with TPP levels were determined using the mummichog pathway enrichment
  analysis program (p<0.05). Panel B: Metabolic pathway analysis comparing the lowest
  versus highest TPP whole blood concentration tertile. Numerous metabolic pathways,
  spanning amino acid/nitrogen metabolism, glucose metabolism, and vitamin/cofactor
  metabolism were significantly different comparing the lowest tertile versus the
  highest TPP concentration tertile (p<0.05)'
