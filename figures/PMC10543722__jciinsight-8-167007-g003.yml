figure_title: Metabolic heterogeneity in ACC based on Simpson’s diversity index
caption: (A) Bar chart shows ENSAT tumor stage was positively correlated with metabolic
  heterogeneity determined by Simpson’s diversity index (i.e., higher Simpson’s diversity
  index indicates higher metabolic heterogeneity) (patients n = 72; P values were
  calculated by Pearson’s correlation for continuous values and Spearman’s correlation
  for ranked variables). (B) Distribution and flow of patients according to metabolic
  heterogeneity status and ENSAT stages, along with their survival status. The width
  is proportional to the number of patients. (C) Kaplan-Meier analysis–based patient
  stratification between low– and high–metabolic heterogeneity groups. Patients with
  low metabolic heterogeneity exhibited better survival. (D) Discriminative m/z species–focused
  heatmap clustering analysis reveals a distinct separation of patients with high
  (red) and low (green) metabolic heterogeneity. Columns represent patients (n = 72);
  rows represent m/z species (top 50). Color gradient represents the intensity from
  maximum (red) to minimum (blue). (E) Enriched pathways in patients with high metabolic
  heterogeneity. Each pathway is shown as a circle according to metabolic classifications
  and enrichment scores (vertical axis), as well as topology analyses (i.e., pathway
  impact; horizontal axis). Circle color represents the statistical significance of
  overall metabolic changes within each pathway. (F) Volcano plot of the distribution
  of differentially abundant m/z species, demonstrating 33 m/z species of increased
  (blue) abundance in low-heterogeneity patients versus 103 m/z species of increased
  (red) abundance in high-heterogeneity patients (fold-change cutoff = 1.5). The vertical
  dotted line indicates fold-change = 1.5, and horizontal dotted line indicates P
  = 0.05. (G) Heterogenous spatial distribution of 3 representative metabolites in
  a patient with high metabolic heterogeneity (the vessel region was excluded from
  analysis). ACC, adrenocortical carcinoma; ENSAT, European Network for the Study
  of Adrenal Tumors; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; FC,
