figure_title: A summary of the function of cholestasis-related genes affected by Hypericum
  extract (A) EGFR activation by EGF or any EGFR ligands leads to activating SRC and
  eventually induces choleresis (B) ICAM-1 is an expressed binding molecule on neutrophils,
  which mediates the neutrophil recruitment to the inflammatory sites (C) OPN expression
  in the liver helps with liver regeneration, regulating hepatic infiltration of macrophages
  and neutrophils.
caption: A summary of the function of cholestasis-related genes affected by Hypericum
  extract (A) EGFR activation by EGF or any EGFR ligands leads to activating SRC and
  eventually induces choleresis (B) ICAM-1 is an expressed binding molecule on neutrophils,
  which mediates the neutrophil recruitment to the inflammatory sites (C) OPN expression
  in the liver helps with liver regeneration, regulating hepatic infiltration of macrophages
  and neutrophils. When a ligand binds to integrin, the structure of integrin changes,
  and ILK binds to the tail of integrin, resulting in the activation of the ternary
  complex of ILK, PINCH, and PARVIN. As a result of activating this signaling pathway,
  HSCs become activated, motile, and synthesize more ECM components, including collagen
  type I, α-actin, and fibronectin. PLOD3 generates hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrates,
  which are important for collagen biosynthesis (D) Cholestasis can cause apoptosis
  and necrosis in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Following oxidative stress and increased
  accumulation of ROS, cholestasis induces BAX expression. BAX, as a pro-apoptotic
  member of the Bcl-2 family, activates caspases, and releases mitochondrial inter-membrane
  space (IMS). Catalase is increased in cholestasis, which is due to the increased
  demand for hepatocyte detoxification from excess production of H2O2 (E) TLR2/S100A8/S100A9
  signaling pathway is introduced as hepatic CXCL2 regulator, which results in neutrophil
  recruitment
