caption: Transcript–metabolite correlation network demonstrating correlations between
  DIMs and DEGs caused by artificial aging. (A) DEGs related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.
  (B) Correlation network between DIMs and DEGs in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  pathway. (C) DEGs related to pyruvate metabolism. (D) Correlation network between
  DIMs and DEGs in the pyruvate metabolism pathway. (E) DEGs related to glyoxylate
  and dicarboxylate metabolism. (F) Correlation network between DIMs and DEGs in the
  glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathway
