figure_title: Mechanisms of EGFR action and resistance mechanisms of first-generation
  and third-generation targeted drugs.
caption: Mechanisms of EGFR action and resistance mechanisms of first-generation and
  third-generation targeted drugs. (A) EGFR, its ligands and ATP. (B) After binding
  to its ligand, EGFR is activated to form a dimer. (C) EGFR mutations, which no longer
  depend on receptor activation, causes the downstream signaling pathway to be continuously
  activated and eventually leads to carcinogenesis. (D) The first-generation targeted
  drugs competitively bind to the tyrosine kinase domain of ATP, reducing the binding
  capacity of this domain to ATP. (E) EGFR T790M mutation, the binding ability of
  the first generation of targeted drugs is weakened, ATP binding ability is enhanced,
  and drug resistance occurs. (F) The third generation of targeted drugs binds irreversibly
  to C797 residue. (G) EGFR C797S mutation and resistance to third-generation targeted
  drugs occurred
