caption: Changes in the expression level of key genes involved in plastid retrograde
  signaling pathway and post-translational translocation pathway in the leaves of
  ‘HJY’ and ‘FD’ during short-term shading. The horizontal axis represented the duration
  of shading (h); and different letters above the columns indicated significant differences
  at p < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA, Duncan)
