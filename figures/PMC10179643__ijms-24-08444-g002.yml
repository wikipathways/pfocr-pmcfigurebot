caption: 'The mechanism of autoimmunity depends on the host response, resulting in
  the loss of immunological tolerance to self-antigens. (A) Bystander activation:
  this activation is independent of TCR and BCR. The inflammatory microenvironment
  activates bystander immune cells, perpetuating the inflammatory environment and
  forming a vicious cycle; (B) Dysregulation of TLRs: snRNPs can stimulate TLRs, activate
  innate immune cells, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and promote the
  production of anti-SnRNPs autoantibodies [104]. TLRs can affect local inflammation,
  and promote the production of MMPs through MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway,
  leading to the emergence of autoantigen epitopes; (C) Epitope Spreading: inflammation,
  tissue damage, and the release of autopeptides can activate T cells to recognize
  epitopes and activate B cell complementarity, causing epitope spreading. The selective
  cleavage or epitope modification by proteases in APCs also contributes to epitope
  spreading; (D) Autoantigens Complementarity: the autoantigen has a complementary
  amino acid sequence to the initial antigen sequence. The initial protein initiates
  the production of antibodies and causes an anti-antibody response (the anti-idiotypic
  response), resulting in anti-idiotypic antibodies reacting with the autoantigen;
  (E) Immune cell response: mites, fungi, microorganisms, etc., induce epithelial
  cells to secrete cytokines that activate innate lymphoid type-2 cells (ILC2) and
  TH2 cells, causing local eosinophilia inflammation and B cell activation. (Figdraw
  was used to create the Figure 2)'
