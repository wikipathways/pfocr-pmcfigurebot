caption: Effect of NSC-622608 on the progression of KBM5-T315I tumors in vivo. (A)
  Protocol scheme of BALB/c nu/nu female mice engrafted with KBM5-T315I cells. (B,
  C, E) Tumor volumes and body weights were measured every other day for 14 days.
  (D, F) Tumor volumes after extraction from mice at the end of the experiment. (G)
  H&E staining of tumor tissues from each group. (H) Immunohistochemical staining
  for Ki67. (I) Western blot analysis of tumors revealed downregulation of the AKT/mTOR
  and JAK2/STAT5 pathways in the NSC-622608 group. Asterisks (*) indicate significance,
  * indicates p<0.05, and NS indicates no significance
