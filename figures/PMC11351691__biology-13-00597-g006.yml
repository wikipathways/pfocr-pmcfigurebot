figure_title: Effect of Sch A on AKT/GSK3β signal pathway and apoptosis factors in
  rats with DN.
caption: 'Effect of Sch A on AKT/GSK3β signal pathway and apoptosis factors in rats
  with DN. (A) Immunohistochemistry was used to detect p-AKT expression in the kidney
  (scale = 50 μm, n = 5). (B) Immunohistochemistry was used to detect p-GSK3β expression
  in the kidney (scale = 50 μm, n = 5). (C) The expression of AKT and GSK3β proteins
  in the kidney were detected by Western blot (Supplementary Materials). (D) The expression
  of Bax, Bcl2, and Cleaved-caspase3 proteins in the kidney was detected by Western
  blot (Supplementary Materials). (E,F) The quantitative evaluation of p-AKT/AKT and
  p-GSK3β/GSK3β; n = 4 or n = 3. (G,H) The quantitative evaluation of Bcl2/Bax and
  Cleaved-caspase3; n = 3 or n = 5. The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation.
