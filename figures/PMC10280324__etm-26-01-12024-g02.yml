figure_title: Key module selection and functional enrichment annotation.
caption: Key module selection and functional enrichment annotation. (A) Identification
  of the key modules associated with DCM-induced HF. Each row refers to a specific
  module. P-values and the corresponding correlation are stated in the cell. Blue
  represents negative correlation and red represents positive correlation. (B) Gene
  significance for DCM-induced HF in the blue module. (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes pathway analysis of genes involved in the blue module. (D) GO functional
  term enrichment analysis of genes in the blue module. BP, biological process; CC,
  cellular component; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; HF, heart failure; GO, gene ontology;
  MF, molecular function
