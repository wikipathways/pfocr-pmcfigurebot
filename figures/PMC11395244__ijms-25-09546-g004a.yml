figure_title: Effects of G-Rh2 on the expression of TLR4 signaling pathway proteins.
caption: 'Effects of G-Rh2 on the expression of TLR4 signaling pathway proteins. (A–D)
  LPS was incubated with RAW 264.7 cells alone or together with G-Rh2 for 12 h. The
  effects of G-Rh2 on MD-2, TLR4 and P-NF-κB p65 were analyzed by Western blotting.
  The results are shown as means ± SD (n = 3) of at least three independent experiments
  (**, p < 0.01, compared with the control group. ##, compared with the LPS group,
  p < 0.01)'
