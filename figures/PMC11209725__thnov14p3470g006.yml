caption: 'GPAT3 inhibits apoptosis of HCC cells by TAG-initiated p65/BCL2 signaling
  pathway. (A, B) After treatment with sorafenib (MHCC97H: 10 μM; Hep3B: 6μM) for
  72h, cell apoptosis ratios of NC- and GPAT3 OE- MHCC97H or Hep3B cells (A), WT-
  and sgGPAT3- MHCC97H SR or Hep3B SR cells (B) were determined by FCs. (C) CN, SR-WT,
  and SR-sgGPAT3 MHCC97H cells were treated with 80 μM TAG (54:3-FA 18:1) or NaOA
  (80 μM), followed by staining with Bodipy 558/568 C12 and analysis using flow cytometry.
  The apoptosis ratios of MHCC97H cells treated with sorafenib (10 μM) in combination
  with 80 μM TAG (54:3-FA 18:1) or NaOA were also determined using flow cytometry.
  (D) NC- and GPAT3 OE- MHCC97H and Hep3B cells were treated with or without sorafenib
  (MHCC97H: 10 μM; Hep3B: 6μM) for 72 h. The total cell lysates were extracted and
  subjected to WB with indicated antibodies. (E) WT- and sgGPAT3- MHCC97H SR and Hep3B
  SR cells were treated with sorafenib (MHCC97H: 10 μM; Hep3B: 6μM) and TAG for 72
  h. The total cell lysates were extracted and subjected to WB with indicated antibodies.
  (F) NC- and GPAT3 OE- MHCC97H and Hep3B cells were treated with sorafenib (MHCC97H:
  10 μM; Hep3B: 6μM) for 72 h, combined with or without BAY 11-7082 (10 μM), the total
  cell lysates were extracted and subjected to WB with indicated antibodies. (G) NC-
  and GPAT3 OE- MHCC97H and Hep3B cells were treated with sorafenib (MHCC97H: 10 μM;
  Hep3B: 6μM), with/without BAY 11-7082 (3 μM) or ABT-199 (3 μM) for 72 h. Cell apoptosis
  ratios were determined by FCs. Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 3). **p <
  0.01, ***p < 0.001. ns represents no significant difference.'
