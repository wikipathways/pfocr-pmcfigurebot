  PASI score.
caption: Upregulation of the NAMPT-PARP axis in DCs and psoriasis predicts higher
  PASI score. (A) Correlation of RNA expression levels between NAMPT and PARP family
  genes in LPS-stimulated DCs and control cells from the GEO dataset (GSE235310).
  (B) RNA expression levels of NAM salvage pathway-related genes in skin samples from
  psoriasis patients and healthy controls from the GEO dataset (GSE121212). (C) Correlation
  of RNA expression levels between NAMPT and PARP family genes in skin samples from
  psoriasis patients and healthy controls from the GEO dataset (GSE121212). (D) Correlation
  between PASI score and RNA expression levels of NAM salvage pathway-related genes
  from the GEO dataset (GSE121212)
