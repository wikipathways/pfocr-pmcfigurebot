caption: Plant MAPK signaling pathway and the heatmap of the related genes under different
  stress times points for the heat-tolerant cultivar (T11) and between cultivars (T11
  vs. T15). The heat map from left to right means T11_10 min vs. T11_ck, T11_30 min
  vs. T11_ck, T11_1 h vs. T11_ck, T11_4 h vs. T11_ck, T11_10 h vs. T11_ck, T11_10
  min vs. T15_ 10 min, T11_30 min vs. T15_30 min, T11_1 h vs. T15_1 h, T11_4 h vs.
  T15_4 h, and T11_10 h vs. T15_T11_10 h. The “?” means it has not yet been resolved
