figure_title: Transcriptomic changes in p53-associated apoptotic signaling in burn-wound-healing
  pathway.
caption: Transcriptomic changes in p53-associated apoptotic signaling in burn-wound-healing
  pathway. (A–D) Gene–gene network representing the relationships between genes involved
  in p53-induced apoptotic signaling in burn-wound-healing pathway. A node represents
  a gene and an edge represents an interaction between genes. Nodes are colored based
  on their expression changes (log2 fold change) following (A) BDL, (B) CCI4, (C)
  DMN, and (D) DMN + oligonol treatments
