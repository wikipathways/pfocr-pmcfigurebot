caption: Regulatory mechanisms of circular RNAs (circRNAs) during human mesenchymal
  stem cell (MSC) osteogenic differentiation mediated by both Wnt/β-catenin and bone
  morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways and by additional pathways involved
  in human osteogenesis. CircRNAs are able to positively and/or negatively regulate
  MSCs osteogenesis by molecular sponging numerous miRNAs, inhibiting, in turn, the
  miRNA-mediated regulatory activity on downstream osteogenic target genes. This regulatory
  activity can occur on different target genes implicated in (A) both Wnt/β-catenin
  and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways, (B) additional pathways
  involved in osteogenesis. *Predicted interaction. These miRNAs have been reported
  to be implicated in Both Wnt/β-catenin and BMP pathways (Huang et al., 2010, Diomede
  et al., 2016). This figure was made by using the BioRender online tool (www.biorender.com)
