figure_title: RsgI homologs undergo autoproteolysis at a conserved cleavage site
caption: (A) Schematic model of the RsgI2-Sig2 signal transduction pathway in H. thermocellum.
  Cellulose binding to the carbohydrate binding module on RsgI2 generates a pulling
  force that dissociates the cleaved SEAL domain and enables RasP-mediated intramembrane
  proteolysis. Release of SigI2 (I2) activates genes involved in cellulose degradation.
  (B) Coomassie-stained gels of His-SUMO-RsgI(SEAL) fusions from H. thermocellum (Ht)
  RsgI2 and RsgI4 and C. thermocaliphilum (Ct) RsgI. Load and elution (Elu) are shown.
  All purifications were performed in biological triplicate and a representative gel
  is shown. (C) Coomassie-stained gel of purified His-SUMO-RsgI(SEAL)(Ct) after incubation
  at 37 °C for the indicated times. (D) Coomassie-stained gel and immunoblot of purified
  His-SUMO-RsgI(SEAL) variants. Purified proteins were diluted 1:50 for the immunoblot.
  (E) Sequence logo determined from the alignment of >5000 RsgI homologs. Adapted
  from Brunet et al (4). The autocleavage site is highlighted (scissors). (F) AlphaFold2-predicted
  structures of SEAL domains from RsgI homologs with their cleavage sites (scissor)
  indicated. The crystal structure and cleavage site of MUC1’s SEA domain are included
  for comparison
