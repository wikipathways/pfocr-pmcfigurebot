caption: The analyses for potential phenotypes and functions of intestinal microbiota
  in the NC and Pro groups. (A) Relative abundance of nine potential phenotypes of
  intestinal microbiota. (B) Differential phenotypes of the intestinal microbiota
  between the NC and Pro groups. (C) Differential pathways at level 2 KEGG between
  the NC and Pro groups. (D) Differential pathways at level 3 KEGG between the NC
  and Pro groups. Statistical significance was identified by Welchâ€™s t-test with p
