caption: Analysis of expression of genes related to nitrogen metabolism. (A) Heat
  map of expression of nitrogen metabolism pathway and related enzymes. (B) The content
  of ammonium NH4+-N in different samples. (C,D) Activity of GS and GDH enzymes in
  different samples. Values are expressed as the mean ± SE (n = 3). Different letters
  denote statistically significant differences among the different groups (one-way
  ANOVA p < 0.05, Tukey’s test)
