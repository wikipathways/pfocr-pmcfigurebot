caption: The roles of immune-related genes in COVID-19. As illustrated, some HLA variants
  are associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 such as HLA-DRB1*0301, DRB1*14:04,
  DRB1*01:01, DRB1*04:01, DRB1*07:01, HLA-B*4601, B*0703, B*51:01, and B*40:01. Also,
  heterozygote HLA-E*0101/0103 can attenuate the NKG2C+ NK cell responses. The infection
  of a cell with SARS-CoV-2 could result in the secretion of type I IFNs which consequently
  interact with adjacent IFNR1/2-expressing cells to initiate the signaling pathway
  ending in anti-viral responses; however, the presence of rs74956615 in TYK2__endocing
  a tyrosine kinase-related to IFNR1 signaling__ induces TYK2 overexpression, and
  consequently, hurts the lung cells. Moreover, rs10735079 in TYK2 is associated with
  reduced OAS expression and attenuated anti-viral responses. Notably, some SNPs in
  OAS and MX1 could elevate the risk of COVID-19, as well. Similarly, mutations in
  IRF7 and IRF9__components of IFN signaling pathway__ boost SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.
  rs12252 in IFITM3 also attenuates the ability of IFITM3 to block the entrance of
  viral products into the cells. CCR1 and CCR2-MCP-1 could enhance the infiltartion
  of monocytes and macrophages and induce inflammation; with this regard, the pressence
  of activating variants in CCR1 and CCR2 has been observed in critically ill COVID-19
  patients. Besides, the lower expression of CXCR6 could reduce the infiltration of
  CD8+ T cells in the lung, leading to more severe disease. The mutations in TLRs
  such as the deletion in TICAM2, which is related to TLR-4 initial signaling, could
  influence the risk of COVID-19. Similarly, loss-of-function of TLR-3 and TLR-7 impairs
  the IFNs responses. The overexpression of complement system components is another
  agent magnifying the severity of the disease. In patients carrying rs11385949, the
  levels of upper airway viral load and sC5b-9 were greater than others. Regarding
  the roles of DBP in the regulation of vitamin D levels, patients harboring GC rs2282679
  could experience the severe type of the disease. Furthermore, The NK cells isolated
  from severe cases of COVID-19 have shown higher expression of NKG2C and secretion
  of perforin. Moreover, it was shown that Cit-H3 has significant roles in NET formation
  and consequently higher inflammation and cardiovascular complications.
