figure_title: Short-term metformin treatment impacts mitochondrial components and
  activates AMPK signaling
caption: '(A) Metformin reduces protein levels of components of the electron transport
  chain in intestinal tissue. (B) Principal component analysis using proteins annotated
  in the AMPK signaling pathway (KEGG: mmu04152). (C-D) Intestinal protein abundance
  in AMPK signaling pathway in water versus metformin group. (E-F) Western blot and
  quantification of the expression levels of AMPKα and phospho-AMPKα T172. Analysis
  within panel A and B was performed with R using data generated from Proteome Discoverer.
  Data in panel F represent as means ± SEM and paired student-t test was used for
  statistical analysis. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001'
