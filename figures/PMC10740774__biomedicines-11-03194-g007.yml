figure_title: STAT3 inhibitor inhibited AKT signaling pathway and the phenotypic changes
  induced by KDF1 overexpression.
caption: 'STAT3 inhibitor inhibited AKT signaling pathway and the phenotypic changes
  induced by KDF1 overexpression. (A) Stattic treatment significantly lowered the
  cellular level of p-STAT3, AKT, p-AKT, whereas LY294002 treatment reduced p-AKT
  level but did not affect the expression of p-STAT3 in A549 cells overexpressing
  KDF1. (B) Results of CCK-8 assay. (C) Results of wound-healing ability analysis.
  (D) Results of cell invasion ability analysis. ANC: Control-virus-infected A549
  cells; AK: A549 cells overexpressing KDF1; AKly: AK cells treated with 10 μg/mL
  of LY294002; AKst: Stattic (5 μM)-treated AK cells; AKv: solvent (the same volume
  of DMSO)-treated AK cells; ANCly: ANC cells treated with 10 μg/mL of LY294002; ANCst:
  Stattic (5 μM)-treated ANC cells; ANCv: solvent (the same volume of DMSO)-treated
  ANC cells. ** p < 0.01 vs. AK in part (A); ** p < 0.01 in part (B); ** p < 0.01
  vs. ANCv in part (C,D); * p < 0.05 vs. ANCv in part (D). &&: p < 0.01 vs. AKv. ##:
  p < 0.01 vs. ANCly. Scale bar: 100 μm'
