figure_title: HyCar affects the Nrf2 signaling pathway in MCM-stressed hFOB cells
  in a copper-dependent manner.
caption: 'HyCar affects the Nrf2 signaling pathway in MCM-stressed hFOB cells in a
  copper-dependent manner. Densitometric analysis (A,B) and representative Western
  blot images (C) of HO-1 and SOD1 expression in hFOB pre-treated with HyCar, Hy,
  Car, or Hy and Car in the presence or absence of BCS (50 µM) for 1 h and exposed
  to MCM for 48 h. The protein expression levels are reported as the ratio over actin.
  Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Significant differences were indicated using the
  following methods: * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001'
