caption: SDC2 is involved in the FGF2-AKT signaling axis in GC cells. A&B. Effect
  of FGF2 stimulation and SDC2 on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in two lines of GC
  cells (Western blotting). C. Effect of the FGF2-SDC2 binding on cell viability,
  and reversal of this effect by copanlisib in two lines of GC cells (CCK8 assay).
  D. Concentration of PIP3 in the plasma membrane in two lines of GC cells that received
  different treatments (ELISA). E. A schematic diagram showing the proposed mechanism
