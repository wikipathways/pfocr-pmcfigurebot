caption: EBV-affected signaling pathways associated with ferroptosis. Oval shapes
  represent key node proteins of the signaling pathway related to ferroptosis regulated
  by EBV-encoded products. Squares represent EBV-encoded gene products. NRF2, nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor-2; HIF-1/2α, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha-subunit
  protein 1/2; ATF3, activation transcription factor 3; AMPK, AMP-activated protein
  kinase; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase; SREBP1, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1; SAT1, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1; BECN1, beclin 1; ELAVL1,
  ELAV-like RNA binding protein 1; CDKN1A, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; EBV-LMP1,
  EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1; EBV-LMP2A, EBV latent membrane protein 2A;
  EBNA1, Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen 1; EBNA3C, Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen 3C;
  FANCD2, Fanconi anemia group D2 protein
