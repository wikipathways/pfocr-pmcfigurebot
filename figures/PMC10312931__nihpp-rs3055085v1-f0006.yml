figure_title: Hyperoxia modulates developmental pathways in the hippocampus of WT
  animals
caption: A. Volcano plot of genes differentially expressed in the hippocampus of room
  air-exposed WT mice compared to hyperoxia-exposed WT mice (fold change >1.25 and
  FDR<0.1). B. Gene set enrichment analysis for Gene Ontology term and KEGG pathways
  of genes differentially expressed by hyperoxia-exposed WT mice. Hyperoxia-induced
  genes were associated with neuroprojection morphogenesis, neuron differentiation,
  neuron development, axonogenesis, blood circulation, HIF-1 pathway, cell growth,
  chemotaxis, angiogenesis, and vascular development. differentiation, development,
  and axonogenesis. Hyperoxia suppressed genes were associated with NGF stimulated
  transcription, memory, nuclear events kinase and transcription factor activation,
  short-term memory, response to corticosterone, cell surface receptor signaling pathway
  involved in cell-cell signaling, ligand-activated transcription factor activity,
  and response to hypoxia. C. Network plot of select top biological processes and
  their associated genes induced by hyperoxia. D. Network plot of select top biological
  processes and their associated genes suppressed by hyperoxia
