figure_title: The scRNA profiles for monocytes in Ctrl and RA samples.
caption: The scRNA profiles for monocytes in Ctrl and RA samples. (a) UMAP clustering
  distribution of monocytes. Each dot represents one cell, and each color from left
  to right represents cell type and sample type. (b) Expression of CD14 and CD16 on
  monocytes. (c) GSVA shows the difference in pathway activity scores per cell in
  classic monocytes and nonclassic monocytes. Each rectangle represents one pathway,
  with longer rectangles representing higher enrichment. The t values greater than
  0 (red) indicate upregulated pathways, and the t values less than 0 (blue) indicate
  downregulated pathways. (d) Potential monocytes transformation trajectories inferred
  from Monocle2 analysis. (e) Volcano plot showing differential gene expression in
  monocytes at State 3 between Ctrl and RA samples. (f) KEGG analysis of DEGs in State
  3. (g) Proteinâ€“protein interaction network of DEGs in the rheumatoid arthritis signaling
  pathway
