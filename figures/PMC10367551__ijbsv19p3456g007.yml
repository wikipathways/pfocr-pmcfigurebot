caption: 'miR-552-3p inhibits fibrotic and inflammatory genes through the seed sequence
  binding to their 3''-UTR. (A-C) Relative mRNA levels of fibrotic and inflammatory
  genes in LX-2 cells transfected with miR-552-3p and its 3 mutants (1 nM) for 48
  h. (D-G) The protein levels of Collagen I, p-Smad3 and t-Smad3 in TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling
  pathway in LX-2 cells transfected with miR-552-3p and its 3 mutants (1 nM) for 72
  h. (H-L) The activity of luciferase in HEK293 cells transfected with 3''-UTR reporter
  of COL3A1, MMP-2, CCL2, SMAD3 and TGFBR2 (psiCHECK2-COL3A1/MMP-2/CCL2/SMAD3/TGFBR2)
  and miR-552-3p or the corresponding NC (30, 10, 1 nM). Data are presented as the
  mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P<0.05, ** P<0.01, ***P<0.001 vs. NC;
  #P<0.05, ##P <0.01, ###P <0.001 vs. miR-552-3p; ns, non-significant'
