caption: The Mechanisms of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition. The process of inducing
  EMT involves a variety of extracellular signaling molecules, intracellular proteins,
  and the miRNA group, including Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-Î²), Wnt, Epidermal
  Growth Factor (EGF), integrins, Notch, and the associated kinase RIK. These components
  trigger a signaling cascade upon binding to specific receptors situated on the cell
  membrane. Crucial steps in this signaling pathway encompass the activation of diverse
  downstream proteins, which subsequently modulate the activity of particular transcription
  factors. Upon activation, transcription factors such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and
  members of the ZEB family prompt the reduction in cell surface adhesion molecules
  like E-cadherin, ZO-1, claudins, and occludin. This change leads to the disruption
  of tight intercellular junctions and diminished cell adhesion. Concurrently, the
  transcription factors also stimulate the elevation of mesenchymal markers such as
  N-cadherin and vimentin, thereby facilitating the acquisition of mesenchymal traits
  by the cells
