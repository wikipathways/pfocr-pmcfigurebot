caption: SIRTuins’ involvement in DNA repair mechanisms. SIRT6 plays a crucial role
  in the base excision repair (BER) pathway by interacting with key components such
  as Myosin heavy chain (MYH), Apurinic/Apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), and the
  Rad 9-RAD 1-Hus 1 (9–1–1) complex. SIRT1 enhances the DNA repair process by promoting
  the deacetylation of APE1 and Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). In the context of double-strand
  break (DSB) repair, SIRT6 boosts the activity of ADP-Ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1)
  and facilitates the deacetylation of CtIP. It also interacts with the DNA-dependent
  protein kinase Catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and Sucrose Nonfermenter2 Homolog (SNF2H),
  playing a vital role in responding to DNA damage. Moreover, SIRT1 is instrumental
  in augmenting DNA repair by promoting the acetylation of Nijmegen breakage syndrome
  1 (NBS1), Ku70, Bax, and Werner syndrome protein (WRN). In the nucleotide excision
  repair (NER) pathway, SIRT1 increases the efficacy of DNA repair by enhancing the
  interaction between Rad3-related phosphorylation of Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XPA)
  and Replication protein A32 (RPA32), showcasing the comprehensive involvement of
  SIRTuins in maintaining genomic stability through various DNA repair mechanisms.
