figure_title: RAC/CDC42 pathway inhibition partially rescues hepatosplenomegaly and
  decreases Dnmt3a loss–induced myeloid malignancy characteristics in mice
caption: (A) BM cells from Dnmt3a–/– mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated
  C57BL/6 mice, and 6 weeks after transplantation, mice were treated with vehicle
  or the RAC/CDC42 inhibitor (MBQ-167; 20 mg/kg body weight/day) for 14 days. (B)
  Images of spleens and livers from the vehicle- and drug-treated mice. Quantitative
  assessment of liver and spleen weights from vehicle- or drug-treated mice. n = 5–6,
  mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, ****P < 0.00005. (C) Peripheral red cell parameters in mice
  in A. n = 4–6, mean ± SEM, *P = 0.05, **P = 0.005, ***P = 0.0005, unpaired t test
  (2-tailed) performed (B and C)
