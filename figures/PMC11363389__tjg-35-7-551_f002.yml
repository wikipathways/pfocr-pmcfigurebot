caption: |-
  HNK regulated the Nrf2–RIPK3 signaling pathway. (A) The mRNA expression levels of fibrosis-related factors (TGF-β1, TIMP1, and collagen I) in the control group, MAFLD model group, HNK group, HNK+Nrf2 inhibitor group, RIPK3 inhibitor group, and Nrf2 inhibitor + RIPK3 inhibitor group were detected by qPCR. *P < .05 was shown as significance between the 2 groups. Student’s t-test was used to compare differences between the 2 groups. (B-E) The protein expression levels of fibrosis-related factors (TGF-β1, TIMP1, and collagen I), key factors in the Nrf2 signaling pathway (Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1), and key factors RIPK3 signaling pathway in LO2 cells with different treatments were detected by western blot. n = 3, *P < .05, compared with the control group; #
  P < .05, compared with the MAFLD group. Student’s t-test was used to compare differences between the 2 groups
