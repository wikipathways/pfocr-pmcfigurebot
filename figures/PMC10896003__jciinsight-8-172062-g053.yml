figure_title: Endothelial cell clustering, classification, and pathway enrichment
  analysis
caption: (A and B) Representative UMAP plot of the 4 different cluster of endothelial
  cells is shown in A, while UMAP plot for each sample is shown in B. (C) Dot plot
  for the most common enriched genes for immature, stalk, tip, and mature endothelial
  cells. Cell type classification and the percentage and average expression of the
  specific cell markers are shown. (D) Dot plot of the pathway enrichment analysis
  for the upregulated genes of each cluster using gProfiler and PathFindR package.
  Only the most significant differentially expressed genes (log2FC > 1 and Padj <
  0.01) were chosen for pathway enrichment analysis. The graph shows the number of
  genes modulated in each single pathway, the fold enrichment, and the statistical
  significance. (E) Dot plot showing the metabolic pathway gene expression. (F) Dot
  plot showing a panel of proliferation-related genes
