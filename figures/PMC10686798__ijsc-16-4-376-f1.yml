figure_title: Overview of Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway.
caption: Overview of Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway. The absence of Wnt ligands induces
  the phosphorylation of β-catenin by the destruction complex. The complex comprises
  the scaffold protein AXIN, APC, and the GSK3β and CK1α. Without Wnt ligands, β-catenin
  undergoes GSK3β mediated phosphorylation, followed by ubiquitination facilitated
  by β-TrCP for proteasomal degradation. Therefore, target genes of Wnt signaling
  are not activated. Activation of the canonical pathway ensues upon the binding of
  secreted canonical Wnt ligands to FZD receptors and LRP co-receptors. Subsequently,
  CK1α and GSK3β phosphorylate LRP receptors, facilitating the recruitment of DVL
  proteins to the plasma membrane. As a result, β-catenin experiences stabilization
  and accumulation, and subsequently translocates into the nucleus. Within the nucleus,
  β-catenin forms an active complex with LEF/TCF proteins by displacing TLE/Gaucho
  complexes and recruiting co-activators involved in histone modification. This transcriptional
  switch triggers a multitude of alterations in cellular processes
