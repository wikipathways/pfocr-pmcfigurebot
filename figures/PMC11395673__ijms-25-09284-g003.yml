caption: (A) A Venn diagram showing the pathways related to hesperetin and to ADHD
  and the overlapping pathways between them. The diagram was created by the FunRich
  3.1.3 bioinformatic tool. (B) A heatmap showing the pattern of gene expression of
  hesperetin target genes. The diagram was created by the FunRich 3.1.3 bioinformatic
  tool. In the color code, numbers typically range from 3 down to âˆ’3, where the values
  correspond to the degree of enrichment (positive values) or depletion (negative
  values)
