  pathway.
caption: 'Pre-treatment with SB203580 inhibits the activation of the NF-кB signaling
  pathway. NR8383 cells were pre-treated with SB203580 (10 µM) for 1 h and then exposed
  to hypoxia for 24 h. Pre-treatment with SB203580 intercepted the phosphorylation
  of p65 protein. (A) Western blot analysis was performed to examine the protein expression
  levels of p38, p-p38, RhoA, IкBα, p-IкBα, p65 and p-p65 in NR8383 cells in the control
  and hypoxia groups. (B) The relative protein expression was normalized to that of
  the respective control, β-actin. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation.
  *P<0.05 and **P<0.01, comparison between control group and hypoxia group; #P<0.05,
  comparison between the hypoxia group and hypoxia + SB203580 group'
