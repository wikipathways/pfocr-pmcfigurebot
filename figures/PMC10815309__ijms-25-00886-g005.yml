caption: Transcriptomic profiles of FTE organoids of varied genotypes. (A) A two-way
  clustering heatmap illustrating differentially expressed genes in both WT and TP53
  + RAD51D-KD organoids (n = 3 per group). (B) KEGG analyses were performed among
  the indicated groups, ranked by the rich factor. Shading depicts gene counts, whereas
  color denotes the p-value within each category. (C,D) GO enrichment analyses between
  the indicated groups, ranked by rich factor. Shading represented gene counts, whereas
  color indicated the FDR-adjusted p value within each category. (C) Upregulated pathways
  in TP53 + RAD51D-KD organoids. (D) Downregulated pathways in TP53 + RAD51D-KD organoids.
