caption: 'The NODAL exon2 promotes tumour progression and metastasis in A375 cells
  (A) Schematic of the human NODAL locus with its 3 exons (E1 to E3), showing the
  full-length NODAL mRNA above. The primers used to detect its expression are represented
  by arrows. (B) Representative images, acquired at t = 0 and t = 12 h, of scratch-wound
  healing assays performed with A375 and A375ΔE2a cells. (C) Top panel: Normalized
  gap closure rates of A375, A375ΔE2a, and A375ΔE2d cells during the scratch/wound
  healing assay shown in (B). Lower panel: Normalized gap closure rates of A375 cells
  treated with or without recombinant NODAL, recombinant ACTIVIN, or the ACTIVIN/NODAL
  signalling pathway inhibitor SB431542. The p-value was calculated by a two-way ANOVA
  test. (D) Top panels: Representative images of tumours (black circle) formed by
  A375 and A375ΔE2d cells on the upper CAM at the end of the assay (E18). The scale
  bar is 2000 μm. Lower panels: Representative sections of the tumours. Hematoxylin-eosin
  stain. Necrotic areas (N) appear in pink. Higher magnification views of selected
  areas (rectangles) are shown in Figure S1H. The scale bar is 500 μm. (E) Mean weight
  (mg) of tumours formed by A375 (n = 15) and A375ΔE2d (n = 14) cells on top of the
  upper CAM 9 days after the graft. The p-value was calculated via a one-way ANOVA
  test, **** p < 0.0001. (F) Relative presence of A375 and A375ΔE2d cells in the lower
  CAM (n = 7 for both cell types) and in the liver (n = 7 and n = 8, respectively),
  as measured by the qPCR detection of human Alu sequences. The p-value was calculated
  via a one-way ANOVA test * p < 0.05'
