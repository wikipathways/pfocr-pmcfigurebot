caption: 'Proposed model illustrating the network of molecular mechanisms governed
  by miR-1 during early differentiation of the cardiac sinoatrial region. Solid lines
  indicate our results from this work. Dashed lines correspond to previous studies
  in different research fields referred in the Section 3. Our model indicates that
  miR-1 plays a crucial role repressing Mef2c through modulation of Hdac4, Calm1 and
  Erk2/Mapk1. In these molecular mechanisms, miR-1 modulates opposite effects between
  Calm1 and NCoR1/SMRT on nuclear HDAC4 (nHDAC4), thus increasing Mef2c’s interaction
  with nHDAC4, which inhibits Mef2c expression. Also, miR-1 suppresses Erk2/Mapk1
  and, consequently, diminishes MEF2C activity. Additionally, our model indicates
  that RA function is modulated by miR-1, thus promoting the expression of RA target
  genes Tbx5, Gata4, Amhc1 and Rarβ. Moreover, miR-1 increases CrabpII and suppresses
  CrabpI, thus increasing RA activity. The presence of RA disrupts the interaction
  of nHDAC4-NCoR1/SMRT with RARs, thus allowing transcription of RARs target genes.
  Also, miR-1 represses Calm1’s capability to inhibit RARs’ activity, thus enhancing
  the expression of RA target genes. In our model, miR-1 modulates the opposite actions
  between RA and MEF2C, promoting the RA signaling pathway and suppressing MEF2C activity
  to allow properly assign cells to their cardiac chamber. OFT: outflow tract, V:
  ventricular region, SA: sinoatrial region, P: phosphorylate'
