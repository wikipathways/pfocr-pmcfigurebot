caption: ChIP-Seq identification of RUNX1 impact and validation of MUC13 in CRC. (A)
  Heatmap displaying Input and IP Read counts near the transcription start site (TSS)
  in both OE-NC and OE-RUNX1 cell groups. (B) Visualization of the chromosomal locations
  of identified chromatin peaks associated with RUNX1 binding. (C) Bar graph depicting
  the percentage of peaks located in the promoter-TSS regions for OE-NC and OE-RUNX1
  groups. (D) GO enrichment analysis results showing cellular functions predominantly
  influenced by RUNX1-targeted genes. (E) KEGG pathway analysis highlighting key cellular
  pathways influenced by RUNX1, such as cancer and stem cell pathways. (F) Venn diagram
  highlighting MUC13 as a shared target in ChIP-Seq and upregulated in RNA-Seq. (G)
  Differential distribution of MUC13-associated peaks in the RUNX1-overexpressing
  group compared to control cells. (H) Western blot confirmation of MUC13 expression
  in F0 and F3 cells, utilizing primary tumor cells from three different metastatic
  tissues for F3. (I) qPCR and Western blot validate MUC13 upregulation in RUNX1-overexpressing
  F0 cells. qPCR and Western blot confirm MUC13 downregulation following RUNX1 knockdown
  in F3 cells. (J) Co-IP assay confirms RUNX1-MUC13 interaction in F3 cells. (K) Depiction
  of wild-type and mutant MUC13 promoter constructs for luciferase assays. (L) Luciferase
  assays show enhanced activity with RUNX1 and the wild-type MUC13 promoter, while
  mutation reduces this effect, indicating the importance of RUNX1's binding site
  for MUC13 activation. ns, not significant; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001
