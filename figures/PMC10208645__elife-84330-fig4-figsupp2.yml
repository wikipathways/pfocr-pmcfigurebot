figure_title: Affinity purification in high-salt conditions confirmed that Aac2pA128P
  accumulates along the carrier protein import pathway
caption: (A) Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry demonstrated that Aac2pA128P-HIS6
  was about half as abundant as Aac2p-HIS6 after total peptide normalization. This
  is consistent with the low-salt experiment and underscores the need to normalize
  prey protein levels by bait (i.e. Aac2) protein levels. (B) Co-purified proteins
  significantly enriched in Aac2pA128P-HIS6 eluate compared with Aac2p-HIS6 under
  high-salt purification conditions. FDR-corrected p-values calculated by multiple
  t test analysis. See Materials and methods for details on abundance values. (C)
  Immunoblot analysis indicating preferential co-purification of Tim22p with Aac2pA128P-HIS6
  compared with Aac2p-HIS6 in high-salt conditions. (D) Quantitation from four independent
  affinity purifications followed by immunoblotting, as in (C). p-Value was calculated
  with Student’s t test. (E) The association of Aac2pA128P with Tim23p was not increased
  compared with wild-type in the high-salt experiment. (F) Schematic of the parallel
  reaction monitoring approach for targeted proteomic quantification of Aac2p and
  Tim22p in pull-down products. Data depicted as mean ± SEM. Figure 4—figure supplement
