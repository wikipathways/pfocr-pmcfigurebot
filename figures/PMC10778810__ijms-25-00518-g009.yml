figure_title: Effect of MICALL2 on the AKT–mTOR signaling pathway.
caption: Effect of MICALL2 on the AKT–mTOR signaling pathway. (A,B) SKOV3 (A) and
  HO-8910PM (B) cells were transfected with control siRNA or siMICALL2. Subsequently,
  the levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR, and p-YAP were detected by Western blotting. n = 3
  for (A). (C) SKOV3 cells were transfected with control siRNA or siMICALL2. Thereafter,
  the levels of p-ERK and p-p38 were detected. (D) The levels of p-mTOR, p-YAP, YAP,
  p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-p38 were measured in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts obtained
  from SKOV3 cells transfected with siMICALL2. GAPDH and histone H3 served as the
  cytoplasmic and nuclear control, respectively. (E) A diagram (created with BioRender.com)
  was shown. MICALL2 markedly inhibits EGFR degradation by the autophagy pathway in
  a Rac1-dependent manner; in turn, this effect promotes EGFR accumulation and activation
  of the EGFR–AKT–mTOR pathway, while increasing the nuclear translocation of mTOR.
  These processes result in the upregulation of MMP9 expression, which stimulates
  invadopodia formation and ovarian cancer cell invasion. MICALL2 stimulates MMP9
  expression, which may be independent of ERK, YAP, and p38 activation/inactivation.
  MICALL2 also influences immune reaction and closely correlates with T-cell exhaustion
  in ovarian cancer. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
