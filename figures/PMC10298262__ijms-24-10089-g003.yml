figure_title: Expression clusters and KEGG enrichment of the DEGs.
caption: Expression clusters and KEGG enrichment of the DEGs. (A) The DEGs were divided
  into six different clusters. The top 20 KEGG pathways with the smallest FDR values,
  namely, the most significant enrichment among A1 vs. A2 (B) and A2 vs. A3 (C), were
  selected for display. The degree of enrichment is indicated by the rich factor,
  FDR value and number of genes enriched in the pathway. A larger rich factor indicates
  a greater degree of enrichment
