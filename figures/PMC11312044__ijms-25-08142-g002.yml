caption: Thr affects the JAK-STAT pathway. (A) qPCR detection of PDGFRB, IL-6, JAK1,
  JAK2, TYK2, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5B mRNA levels. (B) Western blotting to detect
  STAT3 protein and phosphorylation level. Data are means ± SEM; n = 3–6 biologically
  independent replicates obtained from independent experiments (represented by white
  circles). a–e Different letters indicate significant differences between groups
