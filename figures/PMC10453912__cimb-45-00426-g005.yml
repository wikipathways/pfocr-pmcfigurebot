caption: Activation of the TLR-mediated pathway through the application of sericin.
  (a) demonstrates increased expression levels of TLR-2, TLR-3, and TLR-4 induced
  by sericin. (b) shows that the application of mouse TLR-2 neutralizing antibodies
  results in a decrease in the level of BMP-2/4 expression initiated by sericin. (c)
  reflects that the application of an inhibitory peptide (Pepinh) for TRIF and MyD88
  yields a similar effect to that of TLR-2 antibodies. A coculture experiment with
  RAW264.7 cells (macrophage) and MC3T3-E1 cells (osteoblast) supports these findings.
  (d) provides a schematic representation of the coculture system. (e) reveals that
  sericin application boosts BMP-2/4 levels in RAW264.7 cells. In MC3T3-E1 cells,
  the expression levels of Runx2, osteocalcin, and osteonectin were found to be higher
  in the RAW264.7 cells of the sericin application group compared to the RAW264.7
  cells not treated with sericin (modified from authorâ€™s own publication [38])
