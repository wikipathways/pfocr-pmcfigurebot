caption: Illustration represents the polyphenols targeting the NF-κB pathway associated
  with Parkinson's disease. The activation of the NF-κB, MAPK, and Nrf2 pathways by
  amyloid-beta plaque and neurofibrillary tangles ultimately results in the leaking
  of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuroinflammation, which ultimately leads to
  Parkinson's disease
