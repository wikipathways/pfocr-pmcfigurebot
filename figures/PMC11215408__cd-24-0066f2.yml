caption: 'Gut microbiome assessment after treatment with vancomycin preconditioning,
  followed by SER-401 and nivolumab (vs. placebo control). D-7 time point is after
  vancomycin but before SER-401 or nivolumab, whereas C1D1 is after SER-401 lead-in
  but before nivolumab initiation. A, Ruminococcaceae family relative abundance, displayed
  by percent change compared with baseline abundance, shows a decrease in abundance
  at D-7 with subsequent recovery. Wilcoxon signed-rank test performed against baseline
  in each arm. B, Stacked bar plots of taxa (by family) present in the gut microbiome
  of individual patients over time. C, Relative abundance of the Ruminococcaceae family
  over time split by prospective analysis of baseline Ruminococcaceae abundance. Colors
  indicate the best objective response by RECIST criteria. D and E, Imputed pathway
  analysis of whole metagenomic sequencing of stool sorted by previously published
  MetaCyc pathways associated with either beneficial or adverse impact in the setting
  of immunotherapy (Simpson et al.; ref. ). In the SER-401 arm at D-7 (after preconditioning
  but before microbiome intervention), there were lower levels of beneficial pathways
  and higher levels of adverse pathways; these differences were not present at baseline
  and did not persist at C1D1 (after initial microbiome intervention but before nivolumab).
  Wilcoxon rank sum test performed between arms. Abx: antibiotic treatment (vancomycin
  in SER-401 arm; placebo antibiotic in the placebo arm).'
