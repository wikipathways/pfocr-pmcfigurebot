caption: PPP4R3A and p.Asp409Asn mutant regulate the growth of thyroid cells via the
  Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. (A) Volcano plot representing differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) identified through RNA-seq analysis in TPC-1 cells transfected with
  PPP4R3A sh-RNA 2 compared with sh-NC. The horizontal axis indicates the fold change
  (log2FoldChange) of gene expression between the sh-2 and sh-NC groups. The vertical
  axis represents the significance level of expression difference (−log10padj), with
  up-regulated genes denoted by red dots and down-regulated genes by green dots; (B,C)
  Enrichment analysis of DEGs after shPPP4R3A transfection using Gene Ontology (GO)
  and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway is highlighted within the red box; (D) Western blot analysis confirming
  that PPP4R3A knockdown enhanced Akt/mTOR pathway activation in the normal thyroid
  cell line Nthy-ori 3–1 and two PTC cell lines (TPC-1 and B-CPAP). Quantification
  data are presented on the right panel; (E) Western blot analysis showing the differential
  effects of overexpressing wild-type (WT) and Asp409Asn mutant (MUT) PPP4R3A on Akt/mTOR
  pathway activation in the normal thyroid cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 and PTC cell line
  B-CPAP. Quantification data represent mean ± SD. for three independent experiments.
  Supplementary material provides duplicate results. Error bars indicate standard
  deviation. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.005, **** p < 0.001
