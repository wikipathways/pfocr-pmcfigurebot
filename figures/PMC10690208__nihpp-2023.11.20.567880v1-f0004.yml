figure_title: Enhancer indirect targets in cancer cells form network motifs
caption: 'a. The circos plot illustrates 19 regulatory elements across the genome
  that, when perturbed by CRISPRi, result in altered expression of multiple cell cycle
  genes. These are examples of “one to multiple” enhancer motifs. Annotated genes
  in green belong to the cell cycle pathway. The purple lines in the outer ring indicate
  the localization of enhancers regulating cell cycle genes. The green lines in the
  inner ring indicate the target genes of the enhancers. The lines within the rings
  show the regulation and directionality of enhancer to gene. Knockdown of each enhancer
  alters the expression of multiple cell cycle genes.b. Genome browser snapshot of
  the PDS5B locus, with targeted enhancer indicated. This example is 1 of the 19 regulatory
  elements illustrated in A above.c. Bulk qPCR confirms the loss of PDS5B expression
  with chr13 enhancers perturbation. (NC: non-target control sgRNA, 9 biological replicates,
  * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001, Student’s t-test).d. Manhattan plot of PDS5B
  enhancer perturbation shows that multiple cell cycle genes lose expression. The
  dotted line indicates the perturbed region.e. GSEA of bulk RNA-seq validation experiment
  shows that the cell cycle pathway is down-regulated with PDS5B enhancer perturbation.f.
  The heatmap derived from bulk RNA-seq analysis shows that multiple genes of the
  cell cycle pathway are down-regulated with CRISPRi of the PDS5B enhancer.g. The
  circos plot demonstrates “multiple to one’”enhancer regulatory motifs for COSMIC
  cancer genes.h. The “reverse” Manhattan plot from analysis of single-cell CRISPRi
  screen data shows three enhancers across the genome annotated in purple that indirectly
  regulate TP53 expression. The y-axis indicates the adjusted p-value of TP53 in each
  enhancer perturbation.i. The circos plot indicates that several enhancers across
  the genome indirectly down-regulate TP53 in single cell data.j. The genome browser
  snapshot of chr17 enhancer.k. Bulk qPCR experiments confirm the indirect regulation
  of TP53 expression. We validated chr17 enhancer and chr6 enhancer have the ability
  to indirectly regulate TP53. TP53 promoter perturbation and chr6 enhancer perturbation
  belong to the same experimental batch and share the same sgNC control samples. (NC:
  non-target control sgRNA, TP53 promoter: 3 biological replicates, chr17 enhancer:
  9 biological replicates, ch6 enhancer: 3 biological replicates, chr2 enhancer: 9
  biological replicates, * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001, Student’s t-test).l.
  Bulk qPCR experiments identify MED1 as the primary target of chr17 enhancer and
  SERAC1 as the primary target of chr6 enhancer. (NC: non-target control sgRNA, chr17
  enhancer: 9 biological replicates, chr6 enhancer: 3 biological replicates, * p<
  0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001, Student’s t-test).m. MED1 promoter perturbation
  leads to TP53 down-regulated in bulk qPCR. (NC:non-target control sgRNA, 8 biological
  replicates, * p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001, Student’s t-test).n. Schematic
  illustration shows that chr17 enhancer and chr6 enhancer indirectly regulate TP53
  through MED1 and SERAC1 respectively'
