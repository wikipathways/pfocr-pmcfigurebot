  and estrus stages.
caption: Screening of ovarian transcription patterns in female rabbits at diestrus
  and estrus stages. (A) The volcano map of the DEGs between diestrus and estrus.
  (B) The number of DEGs between diestrus and estrus. (C) GO classification map of
  the DEGs between diestrus and estrus. (D) KEGG signaling pathway classification
  diagram of the DEGs between diestrus and estrus. (E) Verification of mRNA expression
  levels of the DEGs between diestrus and estrus. * indicates significant difference
  (p < 0.05), ** indicates extremely significant difference (p < 0.01). D indicates
  the diestrus group, and E indicates the estrus group
