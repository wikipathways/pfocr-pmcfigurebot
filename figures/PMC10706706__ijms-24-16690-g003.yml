caption: Classification of DEGs in mustard leaves chewed by beet armyworm larvae according
  to GO database, minimum connected molecular networks and KEGG database. (A) GO enrichment
  analysis of DEGs. (B) Minimum connected molecular networks based on DEGs in each
  time point and the PPI from STRING database. Red points, upregulated DEGs; green
  points, downregulated DEGs; gray points, non-seed DEGs. (C) KEGG classification
  of upregulated DEGs. The X-axis represents the enrichment, which is the ratio of
  the number of DEGs to the total number of genes in a certain pathway. The color
  and size of the dots represent the range of −log10 (p-value) and the number of DEGs
  mapped to the indicated pathways, respectively
