caption: Expression of the DBNDD1 signaling pathway in prostate cancer (MetaCore).
  Using the MetaCore platform to analyze genes co-expressed with DBNDD1 from the associated
  TCGA dataset, we found that “Regulation of GSK3-beta in bipolar disorder” was linked
  to prostate cancer progression (with p < 0.05 set as the cutoff value)
