figure_title: Cr(VI) interfered with the energy balance through inhibiting the AMPK/PGC-1α
  signaling pathway in the liver (A) AMPK and PGC-1α protein bands; (B) AMPK and PGC-1α
  protein expression levels; (C) CS activity; (D) MDH activity; (E) ATP content.
caption: Cr(VI) interfered with the energy balance through inhibiting the AMPK/PGC-1α
  signaling pathway in the liver (A) AMPK and PGC-1α protein bands; (B) AMPK and PGC-1α
  protein expression levels; (C) CS activity; (D) MDH activity; (E) ATP content. With
  the column data, the same letters on the shoulder mean that the difference is not
  significant (p > 0.05), different small letters mean a significant difference (p
  < 0.05), and different capital letters mean an extremely significant difference
  (p < 0.01)
