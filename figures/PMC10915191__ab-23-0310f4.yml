  pathway.
caption: Effects of Tet1 knockdown on PGC proliferation via Wnt4/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. (A) Detection of cell cycle was conducted in Tet1 knockdown and inhibitor
  treated PGCs by flow cytometry. (B) Cell growth of each group was measured using
  the CCK8 assay. (C) The expression of cell cycle-related genes (Cyclin D1 and CDK6)
  was tested by qRT-PCR. (D) The expression of pluripotency-related genes PouV, Nanog,
  and Sox2 was detected by qRT-PCR. Tet1, translocation 1; PGCs, pimordial germ cells;
  CCK8, cell counting kit-8; CDK6, Cyclin-dependent kinase 6; PouV, POU domain class
  5; Nanong, Nanog homeobox; Sox2, Sex-determining region Y-box2; qRT-PCR, quantitative
  real time polymerase chain reaction. a–d Means having different letters are different
  (p<0.05) (n = 3)
