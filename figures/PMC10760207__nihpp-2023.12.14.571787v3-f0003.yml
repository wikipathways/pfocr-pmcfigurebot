caption: A-D) Real-time PCR analysis of cytokines mRNA expression in different Ogt−/−
  cell lines including MC38 (A), LLC (B), HT29 (C), B16-OVA (D) cells. E) Western
  blot analysis of the activation of the interferon signaling pathway in different
  Ogt−/− cell lines including MC38, LLC and B16-OVA cells. F) Western blot analysis
  of the activation of the interferon signaling pathway in Ogt−/− rescued cell lines
  including MC38, LLC, HT29 and B16-OVA cells. G-H) Real-time PCR and western blot
  analysis of cytokines mRNA expression and the activation of the interferon signaling
  pathway in different Ogt−/−Mavs−/− double knockout clones in MC38 cells. I-K) Real-time
  PCR and ELISA analysis of cytokines mRNA expression in Ogt−/−cGAS−/− double knockout
  clones in MC38 (I-J), HT29 (K) cells. L) Western blot analysis of the activation
  of the interferon signaling pathway in Ogt−/−cGAS−/− or Ogt−/−Sting−/− double knockout
  clones in MC38, HT29 and B16-OVA cells. M-N) BMDCs pre-treated with B16-OVA-Ogt−/−
  (L), B16-OVA-Ogt−/−cGAS−/− or B16-OVA-Ogt−/−Sting−/− cells (M) supernatant, and
  co-cultured with OT-1 T cell, then T cell proliferation was evaluated by flow cytometry,
  OVA257−264 as a positive control. Representative fluorescence-activated cell sorting
  histograms and statistical data are shown. Data are representative of two or three
  independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student’s
  t-test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, *p < 0.05,**p < 0.01,***p < 0.001, ns, no
  significant difference. Data represent the mean of ± SD
