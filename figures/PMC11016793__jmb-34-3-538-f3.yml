  (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of 1,907 DEGs
caption: '(A) GO annotation analysis of the 1,907 DEGs was carried out using the blastGO
  platform. The figure presents 24 identified GO terms from the three primary categories:
  “cellular components,” “molecular function,” and “biological process.” The numbers
  of up- and down-regulated DEGs in each identified GO term are also shown. (B) KEGG
  pathway enrichment analysis of the 1,907 DEGs was conducted using KEGG pathway database.
  The top 20 enriched pathways were determined based on p-value, rich factor, and
  the count of enriched genes'
