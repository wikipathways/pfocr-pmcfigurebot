figure_title: Optogenetic EGFR stimulation directs tissue movement
caption: (A) Schematic of OptoEGFR construct for blue light-inducible EGFR clustering
  and signaling pathway activation. The system fuses an N-terminal membrane localization
  tag to the OptoDroplet system for light-inducible clustering (FUSN-FusionRed-Cry2)
  and the cytosolic domains of EGFR. (B) We set out to assay for phenotypic consequences
  to OptoEGFR stimulation. (C-D) Light stimulation of OptoEGFR RPE-1 cells produces
  dramatic tissue movements, including tissue densification in illuminated interior
  regions (in C) and tissue outgrowth from illuminated tissue edges (in D). Images
  show FusionRed channel; stimulation time shown
