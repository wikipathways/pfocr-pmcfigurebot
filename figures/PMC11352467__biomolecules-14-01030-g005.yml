caption: Predictive-network-based analysis involving the activation of NF-κB (A),
  IL-6 (B), and IL-8 (C). The modulation of the three targets predicted a positive
  correlation with miR-191-5p, as well as with other nodes related to disease, including
  IL-1, CRP, and TNF-α, among others. The bioinformatic survey pinpointed a signaling
  pathway consistent with expression results and reconstructed the molecular neighborhood
  around targets with several connection nodes that are valuable for a more comprehensive
  evaluation of the role of miR-191-5p in the pathogenesis of COPD
