  response via inhibition of the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo.
caption: 'MCPIP1 facilitates M2-polarization of microglia and alleviates the inflammatory
  response via inhibition of the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo. (A) Western
  blotting was used to semi-quantify Iba-1 protein expression. mRNA expression levels
  of (B) CD16, CD32 and iNOS, and (C) IL-4, IL-10, Arg-1 and CD206 were quantified
  using Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. (D) IL-6, (E) TNF-α and (F) IL-1β
  levels were assessed using ELISA. (G) Protein expression levels were semi-quantified
  using western blotting. *P<0.05 vs. control. #P<0.05 vs. LPS + NC group. MCPIP1,
  monocyte chemotactic protein-1-induced protein 1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NC, negative
  control; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; Arg-1, arginase 1; TRAF6, TNF receptor
  associated factor 6; p, phosphorylated'
