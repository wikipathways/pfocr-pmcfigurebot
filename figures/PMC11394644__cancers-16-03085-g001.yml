caption: NAD+ biosynthesis pathways. NAD+ is synthesized through three different pathways,
  the de novo, Preiss–Handler, and salvage pathways. (A) The de novo pathway is the
  longest pathway, utilizing tryptophan (Trp) to produce quinolinic acid (QA) through
  a reaction cascade that feeds into the Preiss–Handler pathway. (B) The Preiss–Handler
  pathway converts nicotinic acid (NA) that has come from a dietary source into NAMN
  via NAPRT, which is then converted to NAAD by NMNAT enzymes allowing for the final
  step of forming NAD+ through NADSYN. (C) The NAD+ salvage pathway uses NAM, a product
  of enzymatic NAD+ consumption, back into NAD+ with NAMPT, regulating the rate limiting
  reaction in the process. Created with BioRender.com accessed 3 September 2024
