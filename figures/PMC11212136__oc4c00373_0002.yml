caption: Proximitomics based on phenoxyl radicals. (a) Upon generation by phenol oxidation,
  phenoxyl radicals react with proteins and nucleic acids. For proteins, tyrosine
  residues are the main substrates for phenoxy radicals. (b) APEX catalyzes the oxidation
  of biotin–phenol into phenoxyl radicals by H2O2, thus allowing for spatial proteomics
  and transcriptomics analysis in various subcellular compartments. (c) APEX enables
  the identification of protein interaction networks, e.g., intracellular regulators
  of the GPCR signaling pathway. (d) Directing HRP by antibody–antigen recognition
  into specific subcellular regions in fixed cells or on the surface of living cells
  enables proximitomic studies without genetic manipulations. (e) Compared to biotin–phenol,
  biotin–aniline and biotin–naphthylamine are identified as better probes for APEX-based
  nucleic acid labeling. (f,g) Flavin-based photocatalysts enable the photochemical
  activation of phenol into phenoxyl radicals using oxygen as the oxidant. Recombinant
  LOV variants and antibody–flavin conjugates are used for protein proximity labeling
  within living cells (f) and recording cell–cell interactions events (g), respectively.
