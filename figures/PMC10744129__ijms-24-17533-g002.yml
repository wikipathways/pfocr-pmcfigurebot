figure_title: Mfn2 overexpression causes metabolic reprogramming in pulmonary arterial
  endothelial cells.
caption: 'Mfn2 overexpression causes metabolic reprogramming in pulmonary arterial
  endothelial cells. PCA (A) and PLS-DA (B) score plots generated using MetaboAnalyst
  revealed separation in metabolite profiles between control and Mfn2-overexpressing
  PAECs. A heatmap illustrates the changes in metabolite levels in Mfn2-overexpressing
  PAECs (C). An overview of the TCA cycle and linked glutaminolysis metabolic pathways
  (D). The notations are as follows: the red arrow indicates significantly upregulated
  metabolite in Mfn2-overexpressed PAECs vs. control PAECs group; the blue arrow indicates
  downregulated metabolite in Mfn2-overexpressed PAECs vs. control PAECs group. Mfn2
  overexpression in PAECs significantly increased pyruvate and lactate production
  (E,F). Among the TCA cycle and TCA cycle-related metabolites, citrate, malate, and
  aspartate levels were increased (G–I). The levels of α-ketoglutarate, glutamate,
  and proline were significantly decreased (J–L) in Mfn2-overexpressed PAECs. Succinate
  and oxaloacetate levels were unchanged by Mfn2 overexpression (M,N). Data are mean
  ± SEM; n = 4. * p < 0.05 vs. control PAECs'
