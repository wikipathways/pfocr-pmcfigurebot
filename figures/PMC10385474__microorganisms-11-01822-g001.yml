caption: 'Signaling Pathway of Dysbiosis and the Production of Altered VOCs: Inflammatory
  mediators from pathologic bacteria signal through TLR and NF-kB signaling cascades
  to further promote inflammation and ongoing dysbiosis. Changes in bacterial composition
  promote altered volatile organic compounds in the stool, and hence, an altered smell
  and different signals detected by the E-nose'
