caption: Transient expression verification of VvmiR166 family and its target gene
  VvHB15 in tobacco leaves. VvmiR166a-h and VvHB15 were integrated into the plant
  expression vector pCAMBIA1302 through double digestion (A). The obtained vector
  was independently transformed into tobacco plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated
  method. The expression vector pCAMBIA1302 was used as the control. After 3 days
  of dark culture, DNA was extracted, and specific primers were used for PCR detection.
  After gel electrophoresis, sequencing was performed, which was identical to the
  sequence of interest (B). Agrobacterium-mediated injection of tobacco leaves (C).
  After overexpressing VvmiR166a-h and VvHB15, the expression of NtHB15 and NtHB15-like
  changes. Each PCR assay was carried out using three biological replicates, and each
  replicate corresponded to three technological repeats of separate experiments (D).
  After overexpressing VvmiR166a-h and VvHB15, the expression changes of genes involved
  in the tobacco lignin synthesis pathway were detected using real-time quantitative
  PCR (E). ‘a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h’ and ‘hb’ indicate the overexpression of VvmiR166a-h
  and VvHB15, respectively. ‘ck’ is the control
