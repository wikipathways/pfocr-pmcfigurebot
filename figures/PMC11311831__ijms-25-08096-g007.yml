caption: Exploration of the Regulatory Mechanisms of PYCRs in Renal Cancer Cell Lines.
  (A) Assessment of the impact of PYCRs overexpression on the mTOR signaling pathway
  in renal cancer cells; (B) influence of proline treatment on the mTOR signaling
  pathway in renal cancer cells; (C) CCK8 cytotoxicity assay; (D) colony formation
  assay; (E) CCK8 viability assay; (F) evaluation of the expression of proliferation
  and migration-related proteins in renal cancer cells treated with Halofuginone (HF);
  (G) detection of apoptosis-related protein expression in renal cancer cells treated
  with HF. ns, p > 0.05, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001
