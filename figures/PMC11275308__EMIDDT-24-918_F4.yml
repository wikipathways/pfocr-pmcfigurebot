figure_title: Effects of FXC combined with UCMSCs on Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway
  and apoptosis-related protein expression in diabetic rats.
caption: 'Effects of FXC combined with UCMSCs on Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway and
  apoptosis-related protein expression in diabetic rats. (A) The expression of Nrf-2
  in aortic tissue was detected by immunofluorescence, magnification: ×40; (B) The
  protein expression of HO-1, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax in aortic tissue was
  detected by western blot, and densitometry analysis of the intensity of the protein
  bands was performed. Data are shown as mean ± SD. *p <0.05, **p <0.01 compared to
  the control group; #p <0.05, ##p <0.01 compared to the T2DM group'
