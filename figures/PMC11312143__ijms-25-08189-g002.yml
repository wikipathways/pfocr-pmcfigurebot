figure_title: Mutations in APC protein mimic the effects of Wnt signaling pathway.
caption: Mutations in APC protein mimic the effects of Wnt signaling pathway. The
  normal APC protein inactivates the transcriptional role of β-catenin through phosphorylation
  leading to ubiquitinylation and degradation (left), whereas mutated APC protein
  allows β-catenin to enter the nucleus (middle), similar to the result of an active
  Wnt signal transduction pathway (right). The figure was adapted from “Wnt Signaling
  Pathway Activation and Inhibition”, by BioRender.com (accessed on 29 March 2024).
