caption: Action of harmine hydrochloride (HMH) on mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (MAPKs) and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The expression of MAPKs (A) and PI3K/AKT-related
  proteins (B) after treatment with 0, 12.5, 25, and 50 μM of HMH for 24 h was determined
  using Western blot analysis. β-Actin was used as an internal control
