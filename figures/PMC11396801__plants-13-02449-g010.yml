caption: Gene expression patterns of mogrosides synthesis pathway under different
  treatments. Statistical analysis was performed using an independent samples t-test,
  with six time periods according to different treatments. The reference genes used
  were a combination of CDC6 and NCBP2 to obtain the CT values. Each sample underwent
  three parallel experiments. (A) Expression pattern calculated by RT-qPCR in EtH
  treatment for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. (B) Expression pattern calculated by RT-qPCR
  in MeJA treatment for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. (C) Expression pattern calculated
  by RT-qPCR in SA treatment for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. (D) Expression pattern
  calculated by RT-qPCR in low-temperature treatment for 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48
  h. (E) Expression pattern calculated by RT-qPCR in high-temperature treatment for
  0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (** indicates p < 0.01, * indicates p < 0.05.)
