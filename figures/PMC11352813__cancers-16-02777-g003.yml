caption: Mechanism of action of first-generation chemotherapy (Docetaxel, cabazitaxel)
  in treating CRPC. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel, both taxane-based chemotherapeutic
  drugs, exert their anticancer effects primarily by targeting microtubules. These
  drugs bind to Î²-tubulin, stabilizing microtubules and preventing their proper assembly.
  This disruption inhibits the G2-M phase transition of the cell cycle, leading to
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Additionally, taxanes inhibit androgen receptor
  (AR) transcriptional activity by blocking FOXO1-mediated AR function, which is crucial
  in treating castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). By obstructing AR signaling,
  taxanes effectively disrupt the growth and survival mechanisms of CRPC cells. Taxanes
  also promote apoptosis through the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as
  BAK and BAX while inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL-2 and BCL-XL. This
  dual action triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, characterized by the release
  of cytochrome c from mitochondria, culminating in cell death. Overall, the combination
  of microtubule stabilization, inhibition of AR signaling, and promotion of apoptosis
  underscores the therapeutic efficacy of docetaxel and cabazitaxel in managing CRPC
