caption: Paxillin participates in Wnt, integrin-FAK, and TGF-β signaling pathways.
  Paxillin induces FA recombination through the Wnt5a/JNK signaling pathway. HIMOXOL,
  Br-HIMOLID, ST inhibitor, and HPW-RX40 inhibit tumor progression by inhibiting the
  integrin-FAK signaling pathway to inhibit paxillin expression or phosphorylation
  level, while HAb18G/CD147 does the opposite. GDP-9 promotes paxillin expression
  and paxillin phosphorylation through Smad-dependent pathways. CX-4945 can reduce
  paxillin expression and paxillin phosphorylation by inhibiting the TGF-β signaling
  pathway. Hesperetin can inhibit TGF-β-mediated Fyn activation by reducing paxillin
  phosphorylation to inhibit RhoA expression and rock activation, which affects tumor
  migration and invasion
