figure_title: Regulatory effects of oxidative stress-associated lncRNA pathways on
  diabetic wound healing.
caption: Regulatory effects of oxidative stress-associated lncRNA pathways on diabetic
  wound healing. Nrf2-lncRNA acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) sponge for
  miRNAs 128 and 224. miR-224 and miR-128 inhibit PIK2 and p21cip1, which are involved
  in p53-dependent stress, thereby enhancing the transcription of Nrf2 and cell survival.
  LncRNA MALAT1 is regulated by Nrf2, which has a positive correlation with Nrf2 expression
  in wild-type cells. MALAT1 downregulates the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 to promote
  angiogenesis and upregulates the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF to reduce inflammation.
  LncRNA DLGAP1-AS1 silencing activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, causing the levels of
  TNF-α and VCAM-1 to be decreased and the MDA levels and CK activity to be decreased.
  DLGAP1-AS1 silencing suppresses oxidative stress, endothelial cell apoptosis and
  inflammatory reactions. LncRNA GAS5 activates the HIF1A/VEGF pathway by binding
  to TAF15, and promotes cell proliferation, wound healing and tubule formation via
  the HIF1A/VEGF pathway in HUVECs. Therefore, when lncRNAs activate Nrf2, PI3K/AKT,
  HIF-1, and other signalling pathways, they can regulate the inflammatory response,
  cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis during the wound healing process,
  thus promoting wound healing
