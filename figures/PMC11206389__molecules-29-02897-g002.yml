caption: Changes in NLRP3 signaling pathway proteins in rats at different time points
  and the effects of OMT on early stage of UC after TNBS injection. (A) The protein
  expression levels of NLRP3 signaling pathway were detected at different time points
  after TNBS injection with the lesion tissues from UC rats. (B) The effects of 80
  mg kg−1 OMT on the activation of NLRP3 signaling pathway at the early stage of UC
  were evaluated by measuring the expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, active-caspase-1,
  IL-1β, and cleaved-IL-1β at 8 h and 24 h after TNBS injection
