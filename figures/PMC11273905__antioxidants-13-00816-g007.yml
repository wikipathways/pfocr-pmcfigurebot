figure_title: Effects of protease on intestinal flora diversity and metabolism of
  weaned piglets.
caption: Effects of protease on intestinal flora diversity and metabolism of weaned
  piglets. (A) Relative abundance of Firmicutes. (B) Relative abundance of Bacteroidetes.
  (C) Ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B). (D–F) Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group,
  Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, and Terrisporobacter between the CC group, PR group, and
  the NC group of relative abundance. (G) The metabolic pathway information of each
  differential gene was obtained. (H) The relative values are indicated by color intensity
  according to the legend indicated in the right corner. All data with error bars
  are mean ± SEM (n = 6, 5 replicates). *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01. a,b Different letters
  indicate significant differences between the 2 data
