  LncRNA AC078850.1 enhanced pyroptosis through the ROS-dependent pathway in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells: (A) Effect of siAC078850.1 on cellular oxidative stress, examined using ROS production (n = 3, scale bar: 100 μm); (B) The protein levels of ITGB2 and RAC1 were determined using western blot in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells treated with siAC078850.1 (n = 6); (C) The protein levels of NLRP3, cleaved-caspase 1, cleaved-GSDMD, IL-1β, and IL-18 were determined using western blot in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells treated with siAC078850.1 (n = 6); (D) Effect of AC078850.1 plasmids on cellular oxidative stress, examined using ROS production (n = 3, scale bar: 100 μm); (E) The protein levels of ITGB2 and RAC1 were determined using western blot in THP-1-derived macrophages treated with AC078850.1 plasmids (n = 6); (F) The protein levels of NLRP3, cleaved-caspase 1, cleaved-GSDMD, IL-1β, and IL-18 were determined using western blot in THP-1-derived macrophages treated with AC078850.1 plasmids (n = 6). The results were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Measurement data have been presented as mean ± SD. Differences between groups were determined using Student’s t-tests. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, and ns
