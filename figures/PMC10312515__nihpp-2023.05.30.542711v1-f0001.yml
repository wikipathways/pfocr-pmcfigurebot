figure_title: Rescue of secretion of the Trop-2-Q118E-EYFP- mutant glycoprotein upon
  UGGT1 inactivation
caption: Confocal images of single optical sections of transiently transfected HEK
  293T (live imaging) and Vero E6 cells (fixed cells). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst
  33342 in HEK 293T cells or with DAPI stain in Vero E6 cells (blue). (A, B) Wild
  type (WT) and UGGT1−/− HEK 293T and Vero E6 cells were transiently transfected with
  Trop-2-pEYFP-N1 and Trop-2-Q118E-pEYFP-N1 plasmids. (A) The Trop-2-EYFP wild-type
  glycoprotein (green) traverses the secretory pathway and reaches the plasma membrane
  (white arrowheads); (B) in WT cells, the Trop-2-Q118E-EYFP mutant glycoprotein (green)
  is visible in the secretory pathway but absent from the plasma membrane. In the
  UGGT1−/− cells, the same Trop-2-Q118E-EYFP mutant glycoprotein reaches the cellular
  membrane (white arrowheads). (C, D) WT, UGGT1−/−, UGGT2−/−, and UGGT1/2−/− HEK 293T
  cells were transiently transfected with Trop-2-pEYFP-N1 (C) and Trop-2-Q118E-pEYFP-N1
  (D) plasmids. Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) Alexa Fluor 555 (orange) enables verification
  of plasma membrane localisation of the fluorescent fusion glycoproteins; (C) in
  both WT and UGGT1−/− HEK 293T cells the Trop-2-EYFP-WT glycoprotein (green) reaches
  the cellular membrane (white arrowheads); (D) in the WT HEK 293T cells the Trop-2-Q118E-EYFP
  mutant glycoprotein (green) is trapped in the secretory pathway, while in the UGGT1−/−
  and UGGT1/2−/− HEK 293T cells (and to a lower extent in UGGT2−/− cells) the same
  mutant glycoprotein is visible both in the ER and in the membrane (white arrowheads)
