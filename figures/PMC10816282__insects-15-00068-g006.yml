caption: Transcription response to APS of the JNK/MAPK (A), JAK/STAT (B), Toll and
  Imd (C) signaling pathway genes in the control and GagrRNAi females and males. Genes
  that changed transcription by more than 2 times are shown in red (increase) and
  blue (decrease). Genes that changed transcription significantly, but not more than
  50%, are shown in pink or light blue; genes that did not change transcription are
  shown in black. The LFC values are shown in brackets
