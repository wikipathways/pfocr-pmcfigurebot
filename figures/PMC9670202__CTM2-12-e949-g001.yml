caption: 'Reciprocal links between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and different
  melatonergic pathways suggestive of melatonin as a viable therapeutic target and
  chronomodulator of COVID‐19 infection. (1) Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) entry into host cells results in a pro‐inflammatory cytokine storm
  that is further exacerbated by the constitutive activation of the renin–angiotensin
  activating system along with the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis due to angiotensin
  II (Ang II) accumulation and the loss of surface angiotensin converting enzyme.
  (2) The pro‐inflammatory cytokines may suppress melatonin production in the pineal
  gland via the immune pineal axis and increased cytokine levels lead to the activation
  of the indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3‐dioxygenase (TDO) enzymes.
  IDO/TDO activation promotes the degradation of tryptophan into kynurenine and reduces
  the rate of tryptophan conversion into melatonin. Melatonin metabolism will be also
  affected by cytokine‐mediated gut dysbiosis and impaired gut permeability, which
  may lead to reduced uptake of tryptophan and the microbiome‐derived short chain
  fatty acid butyrate accompanied by increased permeability to lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) which can induce further cytokine production. (3) This results in a marked
  decrease in melatonin levels and the corresponding loss of its anti‐inflammatory,
  anti‐oxidative, immune enhancing and cytoprotective effects, which are largely mediated
  via the induction of Bmal1 disinhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate decarboxylase–acetyl
  CoA and inhibition of the pro‐inflammatory NF‐κB pathway. Moreover, the altered
  melatonin levels will disrupt the sleep/wake cycles of COVID‐19 patients which will
  further increase their susceptibility. All the previously mentioned developments
  are expected to increase the severity of inflammation and worsen disease progression.
