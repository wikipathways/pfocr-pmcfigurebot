caption: Detection of metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells at a single-cell resolution
  (A) Metabolic pathway activities in each cell type for scRNA-seq profiles. Statistically
  nonsignificant values (random permutation test p > 0.05) are shown as blanks (B)
  Metabolic pathway activities in STAD tumor samples and matched normal samples from
  TCGA (C) Scatter plot of pathway activities in bulk STAD tumors from TCGA and in
  single epithelial cells (D) Distributions of pathway activities in different cell
  types from the scRNA-seq dataset. Epithelial_cell_C represents cancer epithelial
  cells; epithelial_cell_T represents normal epithelial cells; fibroblast_C represents
  CAFs, and macrophage_C represents TAMs (E) Distributions of pathway activities in
  STAD tumor samples and matched normal samples from TCGA.
