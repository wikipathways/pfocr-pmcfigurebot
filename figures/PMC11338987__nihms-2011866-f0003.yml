figure_title: Genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses of polymyxin-dependent
  A. baumannii strains
caption: (A) Clustering analysis of the whole genome of 15,049 A. baumannii strains
  from GenBank and the wild-type strains of the four polymyxin-dependent strains in
  the present study.(B) Heatmap showing the fold changes of common DEGs in all four
  polymyxin-dependent strains compared to their parent strains.(C) Heatmap showing
  commonly changed metabolites in polymyxin-dependent strains compared to their wild-type
  strains following treatment with 16 mg/L colistin for 2 h in dependent strains plus
  untreated control. S, polymyxin-susceptible parent strains (no colistin treatment);
  D, polymyxin-dependent strains (no colistin treatment); DC, polymyxin-dependent
  strains treated with 16 mg/L colistin.(D) Pathway enrichment analysis of the integrative
  transcriptomics and metabolomics data in all four polymyxin-dependent strains compared
  to their wild-type strains.(E) Network analysis of the significant metabolites (green
  circle) and genes (red square) in all four polymyxin-dependent strains compared
  to their wild-type strains. Only metabolites/genes with a network degree >5 are
  labeled.The pathway analysis in (D) and (E) was based on the KEGG Database and performed
  with MetaboAnalyst20 and OmicsNet,21 respectively
