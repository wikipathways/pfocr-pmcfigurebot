caption: RNA-sequencing results of DEGs and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in WPMY-1
  cells after Cu B treatment for 48 h. Volcano chart (Aâ€“C) and column chart (D) showing
  the number of DEGs up- and down-regulated in the Cu B (25 nM) group versus the control,
  Cu B (50 nM) group versus the control, and Cu B (50 nM) group versus Cu B (25 nM)
  group. (E) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs between the Cu B (25 nM) group and the
  control group. (F) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs between the Cu B (50 nM) group
  and the control group (p = 0.037213701 for p53 signaling pathway). (G) KEGG enrichment
  analysis of DEGs between the Cu B (50 nM) group and the Cu B (25 nM) group. Cu B,
  cucurbitacin B; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes. (n = 3)
