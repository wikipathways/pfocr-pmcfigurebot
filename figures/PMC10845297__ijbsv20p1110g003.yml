figure_title: Roles of fibroblasts of metastatic organ in PMN formation.
caption: Roles of fibroblasts of metastatic organ in PMN formation. Tumor-derived
  EVs harboring LncRNAs are capable of enhancing the proliferation and activation
  of lung fibroblasts and generate an inflammatory microenvironment. The exosomes
  derived from tumors result in the activation of lung fibroblasts via the CCL1/CCR8
  signaling axis to improve the proliferation of Treg cells and elevate immunosuppression.
  p38α signaling pathway in the lung fibroblasts is activated to augment the expression
  level of FAP and promote the recruitment of neutrophils and accelerate matrix remodeling
  for ease of PMN formation. Furthermore, IL-1β derived from neutrophils is able to
  boost the release of PGE2 by Ptgs2hi lung fibroblast subset to trigger dysfunction
  of DCs and immunosuppression of monocytes. In the process of PMN in the liver, ITGBL1-rich
  EVs contribute to the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway of liver fibroblasts,
  which further augments the expression and secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 as well as
  propels the formation of inflammatory PMN. The EVs harboring NID1 drive PMN formation
  by elevating the expression level of TNFR1 in the liver fibroblasts
