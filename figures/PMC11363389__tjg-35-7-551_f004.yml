figure_title: HNK inhibited MAFLD progression by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway
  mediated antioxidant activity.
caption: HNK inhibited MAFLD progression by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway
  mediated antioxidant activity. (A-C) The concentrations of MDA (A), activity of
  CAT (B), and SOD (C) in LO2 cells with different treatments were determined by the
  biochemistry detection kits. (D) Flow cytometry was used to detect the ROS level
  in LO2 cells with different treatments. (E-G) The concentrations of TNF-α (E), IL-1β
  (F), and IL-6 (G) (pm/mL) in LO2 cells with different treatments. n = 3, *P < .05
  between 2 groups. Student’s t-test was used to compare differences between the 2
  groups
