figure_title: Regulation of the C-type lectin pathway by M-glucans.
caption: 'Regulation of the C-type lectin pathway by M-glucans. DEG datasets were
  mapped onto the pathway using Pathview. Genes regulated by M-glucans are shown in
  colour, with green showing downregulation and red showing upregulation. Black solid
  lines represent known molecular interaction or relation (▸: activating, |: inhibiting);
  dotted lines represent indirect links or unknown reactions, where +p, −p, +u, and
  −u represent phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and deubiquitination,
  respectively. The symbol O represents chemical compounds, DNA, or other molecules'
