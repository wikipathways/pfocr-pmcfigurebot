caption: 'Src knockdown reversed ombuin-mediated neuroinflammatory inhibition. (A)
  The levels of Src and phosphorylated Src (p-Src) proteins were assessed using Western
  blot analysis following a 24 h treatment with ombuin and/or LPS. (B) The efficiency
  of Src siRNA transfection in BV-2 cells. (C–E) BV-2 cells were transfected with
  either non-targeting control (NC) siRNA or Src siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were
  further treated with ombuin/LPS for an additional 24 h. Then, the impact of Src
  knockdown on the production of TNF-α (C), IL-1β (D), and NO (E) in BV-2 cells was
  measured by ELISA. (F,G) Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the protein
  levels of the PI3K-AKT pathway, the NF-κB signaling pathway, and inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS) in BV-2 cells post-Src knockdown. (H–M) Quantitative analysis
  of the influence of Src silencing on downstream PI3K-AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways,
  as well as the expression of the inflammatory mediator iNOS protein. Data are presented
  as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. ## p < 0.01 indicates significance
  compared with the control group; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and ****
  p < 0.0001 indicate significance; ‘ns’ indicates not significant'
