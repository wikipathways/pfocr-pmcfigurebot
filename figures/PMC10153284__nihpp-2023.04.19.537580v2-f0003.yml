figure_title: Panx1 controls the activation of effector CD8+ T cells through export
  of eATP and late extracellular lactate accumulation
caption: (a) WT Nur77-GFP CD8+ T cells were activated in the presence of PBS or Panx1i,
  with the addition of vehicle or eATP. Nur77-GFP representative histograms (left)
  and average Nur77-GFP+ percentages (right) are shown. (b-c) CD4-Cre or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl
  CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2) for up to 48h, with
  the addition of vehicle or eATP at either the beginning of cultures (b), or at 20h
  after activation (c). (b) Average percentages of CD69+ cells at 3h after activation.
  (c) Average percentages of CD44+ and CD69+ cells at 24h after activation (left);
  average percentages of Cell Tracer Violet− cells (CTV % divided) at 48h after activation
  (right). (d) CD4-Cre or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl effector-like CD8+ T cells (with prolonged
  exposure to IL-2) were incubated in the presence or absence of eATP; average percentages
  of CD69+ cells and of ECAR values are shown. (e) WT (CD4-Cre) or Panx1-KO (CD4-Cre
  Panx1fl/fl) effector-like and memory-like CD8+ T cell cultures were harvested, and
  intracellular lysates and supernatants were submitted for untargeted metabolomics
  (GC-MS) analysis. Enrichment analysis showing pathways preferentially represented
  in the metabolites from the supernatants of WT effector-like CD8+ T cells (WT>Panx1-KO).
  Levels (arbitrary units – AU) of l-lactate in the supernatants (left) and intracellular
  lysates (right) of effector-like WT and Panx1-KO CD8+ T cells are shown below. (f-g)
  CD4-Cre or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28
  + IL-2) for 72h, and l-lactate measurements (mM) were done. (f) Intracellular lactate
  levels. (g) Extracellular lactate levels, in the presence or absence of inhibitors
  for MCT1 (SR13800) and MCT4 (VB124). (h) Average percentages of IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells
  at 72h after activation, with addition of sodium lactate +/− MCT1i. (i) Representative
  histograms (left), and average percentages of CTV % divided and CD69+ cells at 48h
  after activation, with addition of vehicle, MCT1i, MCT4i or MCT1/MCT4i. (g-k) CD4-Cre
  or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro (anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-2)
  for up to 72h, in the presence of the indicated metabolites or inhibitors. (j) Average
  percentages of CD44+ and CD69+ cells after 24h of activation (left), and of CTV
  % divided cells at 48h after activation (right), with the addition of vehicle or
  sodium lactate. (k) ECAR and OCR kinetics (left) and average baseline values (right)
  at 72h after activation, with the addition of vehicle or sodium lactate. (l) Average
  percentages of CD69+ cells at 48h after activation, with addition or sodium lactate
  +/− oligomycin. (m) CD4-Cre or CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl effector-like CD8+ T cells were
  incubated in the presence or absence of sodium lactate (right); average percentages
  of CD69+ cells and of ECAR values are shown. (n) WT Nur77-GFP CD8+ T cells were
  activated in the presence of PBS or Panx1i, with the addition of vehicle or sodium
  lactate; average percentages of Nur77-GFP+ cells (left), CD69+ cells (center), or
  CD44+ cells (right) are shown. (o) WT (CD4-Cre) or Panx1-KO (CD4-Cre Panx1fl/fl)
  P14 cells (CD45.2+) were transferred into LCMV-infected WT CD45.1+ mice. Some mice
  were treated with sodium lactate between days 1–3 post-infection, and spleen P14
  cells were analyzed at day 7 post-infection. Flow cytometry plots showing expression
  of CD127 and KLRG1 (left) and the average numbers of TE, MP and DN P14 cells per
  spleen (right) are shown. (a-d, f-o) Data from 2–3 independent experiments, n=3–14
  per experimental group. (e) Data from 3 biological replicates per experimental group
  (from n=3 mice per group). ns – not significant (p>0.05), *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001,
  ****p<0.0001, One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test (a-d, f-o) Unpaired t-test (e),
  Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-test (m)
