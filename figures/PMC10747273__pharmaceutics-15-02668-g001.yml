caption: Schematic representation of the process through which PpIX can enhance FGR.
  Cancer cells become more fluorescent than surrounding normal cells as they have
  upregulated haem biosynthesis, resulting in greater temporary accumulation of PpIX.
  Healthy normal cells do not accumulate as much PpIX as quickly, as their innate
  haem biosynthetic pathway works at a slower, more controlled rate. This permits
  the two cell types to be differentiated, aiding more precise tumour detection and,
  thus, resection
