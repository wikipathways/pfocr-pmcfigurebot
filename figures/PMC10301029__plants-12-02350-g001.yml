caption: Tyrosine kinase (EGF pathway) and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. The separate pathways
  that control cell proliferation, cell survival, metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation
  that can be targeted by phytochemicals. The Wnt signaling pathway controls the activation
  of the Notch signaling pathway and controls the expression of the VEGF pro-angiogenic
  growth factor. The EGF and other receptor tyrosine kinase signaling activates Cox
  pathways, which promote inflammation through the production of prostaglandins. This
  results in the activation of the AKT protein, leading to pro-survival factors, inhibiting
  apoptosis. Finally, the ERK and MAPK pathways lead to the activation of cell migration,
  induction of cell proliferation, and angiogenesis
