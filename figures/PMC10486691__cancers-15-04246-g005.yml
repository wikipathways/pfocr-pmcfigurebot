caption: 'Detailed examination of Selitrectinib (LOXO-195) influence on EN variant
  behavior, localization and downstream signaling. (A) Morphological analysis of stable
  cell lines expressing different EN variants in the absence and presence of 100 nM
  Selitrectinib. The visual differences highlight the inhibitor’s impact on stable
  cell lines morphology by EN variants. Scale bar: 50 μm. (B) A bar graph comparing
  the BioID interactors of the EN2 variant in the absence and presence of Selitrectinib.
  The interactors that were shared by both conditions are represented in blue, while
  the unique interactors for each condition are showcased in orange, indicating the
  molecular partners potentially affected by Selitrectinib. (C) Western blot analysis
  showing the influence of Selitrectinib on the protein levels of EN variants in stable
  cell lines. (D) Fluorescence microscopy images portraying the subcellular localization
  of EN variants under two conditions: cells untreated and cells treated with Selitrectinib.
  The green color shows the location of the studied proteins on the left and the picture
  on the right show the location together with the blue DAPI stained nucleus and red
  stained actin cytoskeleton. Scale bar: 10 μm. (E) Luciferase assay results detailing
  the impact of Selitrectinib on the activation of four key signaling pathways, namely,
  ERK (via ELK1 reporter), STAT1, STAT3 and JNK (via AP1 reporter). The readouts are
  indicative of the inhibitor’s effect on these crucial oncogenic pathways driven
  by EN variants, with reporter expression levels presented relative to untreated
  cells. Luciferase assay column graphs individual measurements are shown as black
  dots and the level of statistical significance of the EN variant values compared
  to NTRK3 values, is denoted by asterisk-symbols: * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.005), ***
  (p < 0.0005), **** (p < 0.00005) or “ns” for not significant (p > 0.05). See Supplementary
