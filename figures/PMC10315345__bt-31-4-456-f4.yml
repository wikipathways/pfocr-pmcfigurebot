  modulators in the VEGFR-2/mTOR-mediated signaling pathways in cervical tumor cells.
caption: LKB1 suppresses VEGF and HIF-1α expression and phosphorylation of major modulators
  in the VEGFR-2/mTOR-mediated signaling pathways in cervical tumor cells. (A) Cells
  were incubated with VEGF stimulator and then transfected with the control (empty-insert
  plasmid), LKB1, or LKB1 plus siLKB1. VEGF and HIF-1α expression was detected by
  WB analysis. (B) Cells were grown to 85% confluence (exponential growth) and then
  transfected with enhancing concentrations of LKB1 (0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 µg). (C)
  Cells were transfected with various concentrations of LKB1, and nuclear extracts
  were collected. HIF-1α activity was then calculated using an enzyme-linked immunoassay
  kit (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). (D) Cells were transfected with the control (empty-insert
  plasmid), LKB1, LKB1 plus siLKB1, and chetomin, a HIF-1α inhibitor. After 24 h,
  the cells were collected, lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer, and analyzed using WB.
  (E) LKB1 reduced the phosphorylation of major modulators in the VEGFR-2/mTOR-mediated
  signaling pathways. Cells were incubated with 10 ng/mL VEGF and transfected with
  control (empty-insert plasmid) and LKB1. Phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 (Tyr1175), PI3K,
  and mTOR (Ser2448) was visualized by WB analysis. Non-phosphorylated VEGFR-2, PI3K,
  and mTOR were used to verify equal sample loading. (F) The phosphorylation effects
  of LKB1 on Akt (Ser473), PDK-1 (Ser241), TSC-2 (Ser1462), and p70S6K (Thr421) signaling
  cascade components. After transfection with control and LKB1, equal amounts of total
  protein (20-25 µg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by WB analysis with the
  indicated specific primary antibody to the phosphorylated proteins (p-Akt, p-PDK-1,
  p-TSC-2, and p-p70S6K). WB analyses of non-phosphorylated PDK-1, mTOR, TSC-2, and
  p70S6K were used as the loading control. *p<0.05 compared to the control groups.
  All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results
