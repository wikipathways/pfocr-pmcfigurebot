figure_title: Effect of FJE on the NF-κB signaling pathway in NLF, BALF, and lung
  tissue.
caption: 'Effect of FJE on the NF-κB signaling pathway in NLF, BALF, and lung tissue.
  (A–C) Optical density of levels of NF-κB, P-NF-κB, and P-IκB in NLF. (D–F) Optical
  density of levels of NF-κB, P-NF-κB, and P-IκB in BALF. (G) Immunoblotting of NF-κB,
  P-NF-κB, IκB, and P-IκB in lung tissue and quantification of protein levels. Mice
  were administered saline, Dex (1.5 mg/kg), or FJE (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) once a
  day for 16 days. Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 6/group). * p vs. CARAS and # p
  compared with control. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, ### p < 0.001 compared with control,
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. CARAS. Dex, Dexamethasone'
