figure_title: KEGG enrichment analysis results of genes with homozygous SNP mutations
  in HT2, HT4, HTRM2, and HTRM12.
caption: KEGG enrichment analysis results of genes with homozygous SNP mutations in
  HT2, HT4, HTRM2, and HTRM12. (A) Top 20 of KEGG enrichment analysis results of genes
  with homozygous SNP mutations in HT2; (B) top 20 of KEGG enrichment analysis results
  of genes with homozygous SNP mutations in HT4; (C) top 20 of KEGG enrichment analysis
  results of genes with homozygous SNP mutations in HTRM2; (D) top 20 of KEGG enrichment
  analysis results of genes with homozygous SNP mutations in HTRM12. The darker the
  blue, the smaller the p-value. The labeled boxes indicate the entries with the highest
  number of genes enriched in the KEGG metabolic pathway for each of these four materials
