caption: Comprehensive bioinformatical analyses revealed necroptosis could enhance
  T cell signaling pathways in CC. (A) Box plot showed the distributions of ESTIMATE-related
  scores between CC tumor samples with high or low expression relative to the median
  of NRGs expression, and Wilcoxon rank sum was applied for the significance test.
  (B) Heatmap for immune responses based on ssGSEA among NRGs high- and low-expression
  group. (C) The result from GO and KEGG analyses of NRGs. (D) GSEA analysis was done
  under the high-expression cluster. (E) The CIBERSORT result was shown in the comparison
  between low- and high-expression groups by violin plot. (F) Chemokine genes including
  CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL13 with significantly expressed differences are expressed
  higher in the cluster with high expression of NRGs, Wilcoxon rank sum was applied
  for the significance test
