figure_title: Survival curves based on IASLC grades and genomic alterations.
caption: Survival curves based on IASLC grades and genomic alterations. (A) RFS of
  all patients based on IASLC grades. (B) RFS for all patients based on cell cycle
  pathway alterations. (C) RFS for patients with IASLC grade 2 EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma
  based on NPA. (D) PFS for patients treated with EGFR-TKI after recurrence based
  on TP53 mutations. EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; IASLC, International
  Association for the Study of Lung Cancer; NPA, number of pathway alterations; PFS,
  progression-free survival; RFS, recurrence-free survival; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor
