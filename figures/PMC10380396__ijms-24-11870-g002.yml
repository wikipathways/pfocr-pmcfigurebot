  GC prognosis and potential mechanisms.
caption: Bioinformatic analysis of SKAP1 expression and its association with GC prognosis
  and potential mechanisms. (A) SKAP1 expression and its correlation with tumor grade,
  tumor status, age, gender, stage and metastasis (N, M stage) based on the TCGA-STAD
  dataset. (B) SKAP1 expression and its correlation with overall survival, postprogression
  survival, and progression-free survival in GC patients from Kaplanâ€“Meier Plotter.
  The red survival curve belongs to the SKAP1 high-expression group, while the black
  one belongs to the SKAP1 low-expression group. (C) GSEA enrichment pathways (JAK/STAT
  signaling, PI3K/AKT signaling, T-cell receptor signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling)
  in datasets with high or low SKAP1 expression. The statistical significance is indicated
  as ns (no significance), * p < 0.05
