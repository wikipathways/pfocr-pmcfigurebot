figure_title: Starch metabolism regulates pea RSA growth.
caption: Starch metabolism regulates pea RSA growth. (A) The transcriptome and metabolome
  were combined to analyze the “starch and sucrose metabolic pathway”. (B) Heat map
  of the relative sugar contents as detected by the metabolome. (C) Starch content.
  (D) Soluble sugar content. Different lower-case letters are the results of significance
  analyses of Duncan’s multiple range test, indicating statistically significant differences
  (p < 0.05). What is compared here is the significance between different treatments
  at all times. Red and blue boxes indicate up- and down-regulated genes, respectively.
  The main stem of the graph represents the key metabolites obtained based on the
  KEGG database (DAMs detected by the metabolome have an orange background). The normalized
  mean expression of each gene is represented by a colored cell, based on a color
  scale
