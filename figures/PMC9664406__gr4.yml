caption: 'The RNA importome of human mitochondriaSome nucleus-encoded RNAs are actively
  imported into the mitochondrial matrix. They play a variety of roles in mitochondria,
  ranging from cytosol-mitochondrion signaling to participation in mitochondrial essential
  processes such as translation or mtRNA metabolism., All of the known imported RNA
  species are non-coding, and no mRNA has been reported to be naturally targeted for
  import into human mitochondria. Most of the mitochondrial functions of the imported
  RNAs remain undefined and can be different from the functions of these RNAs in the
  cytosol. At the top, the types of imported RNA species, their mechanism of import,
  and their function in mitochondria are shown. From left to right, these are as follows.
  tRNA (tRNAGlnUUG, tRNAGlnCUG, and tRNALeuUAA)., Cytosolic function: translation.
  Mitochondrial function: mitochondrial translation; could play a role in conditional
  adaptation in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Import mechanism: not well defined
  in humans; ATP dependent; may require cytosolic factors and be similar to that in
  S. cerevisiae (reviewed here: Kamenski et al.). 5S rRNA. Cytosolic function: structural
  component of a large subunit of cytosolic ribosomes. Mitochondrial functions: still
  to be defined. Does not act as a scaffold for mitochondrial ribosomes. Disruption
  of 5S rRNA import leads to a decrease in mitochondrial translation. Import mechanism:
  pre-MRP-L18 binds the ƴ-domain of 5S rRNA in the cytosol; this exposes the α domain
  of 5S rRNA, which binds nascent rhodanese, displacing pre-MRP-L18 in the process.
  The rhodanese-5S rRNA complex is then imported into mitochondria. PNPase may be
  involved in transfer of 5S rRNA because its knockdown leads to decreased import
  of 5S rRNA. Import determinants: ƴ-domain (specifically loop E and helix IV) and
  α domain (helix I). RPPH1 (RNA component of RNAse P; H1 RNA). Cytosolic function:
  component of RNAse P, 5′ tRNA maturation. Mitochondrial function: mitochondrial
  localization induces replicative cellular senescence. May play a role in mt-tRNA
  maturation as a part of mitochondrial RNAse P. Import mechanism: mediated by PNPase.,
  Import determinants: 20-nt stem-loop, nucleotides 115–134 (NR_002312.1). RMRP (RNA
  component of RNAse MRP). Cytosolic function: component of the nuclear RNAse MRP;
  5′ 5.8S rRNA maturation; participates in generation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
  precursors of siRNA; cell cycle progression., Mitochondrial function: not firmly
  defined. May participate in mitochondrial RNA metabolism in a complex with GRSF1.,
  Import mechanism: exported from the nucleus in a complex with HuR. The precise mechanism
  of RMRP transport through the mitochondrial membrane is unknown, although it has
  been hypothesized that it may cross the OMM via the TOMM40 complex and intramembrane
  space (IMS) in a PNPase-dependent manner. It has also been shown that levels of
  GRSF1 (associated with RMRP in the mitochondrial matrix) in mitochondria can affect
  RMRP localization. Import determinants: 20-nt stem-loop, Nucleotides 151–170 (NR_003051.3).
  GAS5 (growth arrest-specific 5). Cytosolic function: RNA sponge to buffer miRNAs;
  regulates INSR transcription in adipocytes; acts as a decoy hormone response element
  for glucocorticoid receptor (GR).,, Mitochondrial function: modulates mitochondrial
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux. Import mechanism: Unknown. Import determinants:
  GAS5-loop 2. hTERC (human telomerase RNA gene). Cytosolic function: telomerase-related
  functions; Cellular senescence and cognitive decline in mice as hTERC-53., Mitochondrial
  function: mitochondrion-cytosol communication (hTERC-53 export is affected by mitochondrial
  function). Import mechanism: mediated by PNPase. Import determinants: stem-loop
  structure, similar to the ones found in RPPH1 and RMRP. miRNA (various miRNAs; e.g.,
  miR-1, miR-181c, miR-378, and others); pre-miRNAs).,,,,,, Cytosolic function: repress
  gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Mitochondrial function: stimulate
  or inhibit mitochondrial gene expression, suppress mtDNA transcription, cytosol-mitochondrion
  crosstalk.,,, Import mechanism: It is unknown whether all miRNAs share the same
  import mechanism. PNPase participates in import of miR-378. Import determinants:
  unknown. SAMMSON (survival-associated mitochondrial melanoma-specific oncogenic
  non-coding RNA). Cytosolic function: facilitates p32 trafficking to mitochondria
  in melanoma cells., Mitochondrial function: unknown. Import mechanism: unknown.
  Import determinants: unknown. Straight green arrows indicate that the import mechanism
  is still unknown. Arrows going to PNPase mean that the import pathway involves PNPase
  in the IMS. OMM, outer mitochondrial matrix; IMS, intramembrane space; IMM, inner
  mitochondrial membrane; matrix, mitochondrial matrix. Question marks mean that the
  function/import mechanism is plausible based on the current state of knowledge but
  has not yet been definitively proven.'
