caption: The GAS5–MITF axis integrates the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and autophagy
  system. (A–F) HUVECs in the control group, MITF overexpression group, GAS5 knockdown
  group, and GAS5–KD+MITF-OVER group were treated with H2O2 for 1 h. (A) Fluorescent
  antibodies were used to label TOMM20 and cyt C to assess the extent of cyt C diffusion
  from mitochondria to the cytoplasm after 1 h of H2O2 treatment. (B) Flow cytometry
  was used to assess apoptosis levels after 1 h of H2O2 treatment. (C,D) Green and
  red fluorescent probes were used to label mitochondria and lysosomes, respectively,
  to evaluate the level of mitophagy after 1 h of H2O2 treatment (C with quantification
  in D). (E) MitoSOX™ Red Mitochondrial Superoxide Indicator was used to evaluate
  the levels of mitochondrial ROS after 1 h of H2O2 treatment. (F) Transmission electron
  microscopy was used to assess the type of autophagy and the degree of mitochondrial
  damage. (G) ChIP-PCR assay was used to evaluate the endogenous binding of TFE3 and
  MITF to the promoter of the NFE2L2 gene. (H) The EMSA results showed that MITF was
  directly bound to the probe containing the predicted binding motifs of NFE2L2. (I,J)
  Immunohistochemical staining of Nrf2 in the NC group and MITF-overexpressing groups
  (I with quantification in J). (K) A ChIP-PCR assay was used to detect the endogenous
  binding of TFE3 and MITF to the promoter of the SQSTM1 gene. (L) The EMSA results
  showed that MITF was directly bound to the probe containing the predicted binding
  motifs of SQSTM1. (M,N) Immunohistochemical staining of p62 in the NC group and
  MITF-overexpressing groups (M with quantification in N). (O) Immunofluorescence
  was used to evaluate the fluorescence intensity and intracellular distribution of
  p62. (P) Fluorescent antibodies were used to label Keap1 and p62 and observe their
  cellular colocalization. (Q) Schematic diagram of the regulation of MITF, Nrf2,
  and P62 (R) A ChIP-PCR assay was used to detect the endogenous binding of Nrf2 to
  the promoters of TFE3 and MITF. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p <
