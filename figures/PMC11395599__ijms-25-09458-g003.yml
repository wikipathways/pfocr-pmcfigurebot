figure_title: NETs formation includes NOX-dependent (through NOX-ROS) and NOX-independent
  (through mtROS) pathways.
caption: 'NETs formation includes NOX-dependent (through NOX-ROS) and NOX-independent
  (through mtROS) pathways. Most NETs are eliminated uneventfully after completing
  their tasks (left lower part). A NETs cascade might happen and cause several adverse
  effects to the host, including cancer progression (right lower part). ALI: acute
  lung injury; CitH: citrullinated histone; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LPS: lipopolysaccharide;
  MPO: myeloperoxidase; mtROS: mitochondrial ROS; NE: neutrophil elastase; NETs: neutrophil
  extracellular traps; NOX: NADPH oxidase; PKC: protein kinase C; PMA: Phorbol 12-myristate
  13-acetate; PPP: Pentose phosphate pathway; PAD4: protein arginine deiminase 4;
  ROS: reactive oxygen species'
