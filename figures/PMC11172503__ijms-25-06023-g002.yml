  and its components on cellular senescence, healthy aging, and longevity induced

caption: 'Anti-senescence effect and molecular mechanisms of royal jelly (RJ) and
  its components on cellular senescence, healthy aging, and longevity induced by endogenous
  and exogenous factors. Cellular senescence is triggered by various intrinsic and
  extrinsic stimuli such as ROS, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, genotoxic
  stress, irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents, telomere shortening, irreversible
  DNA damage, or signals such as oncogene activation or the overexpression of pluripotency
  factors. These stressors initiate various cellular signaling cascades, ultimately
  resulting in the activation of p53, p16Ink4a, or both. Their activation induces
  cell cycle arrest by inhibiting cyclin D–Cdk4/6 and cyclin E–Cdk2 and prevents Rb
  inactivation, resulting in continuous repression of E2F target genes required for
  S-phase. ARF can inhibit MDM2 and stabilize p53, which leads to the arrest of the
  cell cycle and cellular aging and the possibility of repairing minor damages. Accordingly,
  senescence is associated with several molecular and phenotypic alterations, such
  as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), cell cycle arrest, DNA damage
  response (DDR), senescence-associated β-galactosidase, morphogenesis, and chromatin
  remodeling. The anti-senesce effects of RJ and its component (MRJPs, 10-had, and
  RJPs) is the result of the interplay between several genes involved in downregulation
  of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS) and targeting of rapamycin
  (mTOR), upregulation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, dietary restriction,
  and enhancement of antioxidative capacity via Nrf2 activation. These signaling pathways
  affect cellular processes associated with longevity: DNA repair, autophagy, antioxidant
  activity, anti-inflammatory activity, stress resistance, and cell proliferation.
  In addition, RJ suppresses cellular senescence by upregulation of SOD1 and downregulation
  of Mtor and catenin beta like-1, and by regulating the expression levels of p53,
  p16, and p21. The life-expanding effect of RJ possibly originates from its antioxidant
  and anti-inflammatory properties, which can promote healthy aging by improving glycemic
  status, lipid profiles, and oxidative stress and hence can prevent the occurrence
  of various debilitating metabolic diseases. Furthermore, it should be noted that
  RJ contains epigenetically active compounds that inhibit DNMT3 or HDAC3, thus changing
  the epigenetic information generated in response to exogenous and endogenous factors
  during the aging process. Note: ATM, Ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, Ataxia
