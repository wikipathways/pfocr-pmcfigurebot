caption: Suggested anticancer molecular mechanisms of sulforaphane. It induces ()
  cytotoxicity and reduces () cancer cells proliferation primarily by (I) modulating
  the expression of genes crucial for cell differentiation and proliferation via the
  phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), and serine/threonine
  protein kinase (AKT) signaling pathways; via inhibitors of nuclear factor-kappa-B
  kinase subunit alpha and beta (IKK-α,β) and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB), inhibiting
  () DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs); and via nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) by binding antioxidant response elements
  (AREs); (II) inducing cell death by apoptosis via Bcl-2-associated X (Bax); B-cell
  lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2); cytochrome complex (Cyt C); caspases 8, 9, and 3; and by autophagy
  via microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 I,II (LC3 I,II); (III) blocking
  the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclins D, A, and B through the activation of p21 and
  p27; (IV) having an immunomodulatory effect by reducing the production of IL-1β,
  IL-4, IL-6 (interleukin), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α)
  and via the proteolytic cleavage of clusters of differentiation 44 (CD44); and (V)
  reducing inflammation by inhibiting cycloox-ygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2
  (PGE2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor
  (PDGF). Created with BioRender.com. “https://app.biorender.com/illustrations/661e36e12bb8f001aab26646
