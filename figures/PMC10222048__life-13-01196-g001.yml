  RNA sequencing.
caption: Metabolic effects of extended opioid exposure on ccRCC specimens by RNA sequencing.
  (A,B) MDS (multidimensional scaling) and volcano plots of the transcriptional profiles
  of opioid-exposed and non-exposed specimens following RNA sequencing. Significance
  was defined as FDR < 0.05 and p < 0.05. (C) KEGG geneset analysis shows signaling
  pathways that are differentially expressed in the opioid specimens compared with
  the naÃ¯ve specimens, including TCA cycle, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism;
  bars are shaded to indicate p-value from low [black] to high [white]
