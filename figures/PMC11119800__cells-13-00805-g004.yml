figure_title: OGT has dual effects on liver fibrosis.
caption: OGT has dual effects on liver fibrosis. (1) Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is
  the key to activating liver fibrosis. After liver injury, SRF interacts with MRTFA
  to promote liver fibrosis. SRF suppresses this process when it is modified by O-GlcNAcylation.
  (2) OGT-deficient hepatocytes can secrete TFF2, which promotes HSC activation via
  the PDGFRÎ² pathway. Similarly, collagen modified by O-GlcNAcylation also promotes
  HSC activation and enhances fibrosis. (3) The O-GlcNAcylation modification of ASCT2
  promotes the decomposition of Gln, thus promoting the development of liver fibrosis
