caption: 'The Aspartate-derived amino acid pathway in plants branching into the biosynthesis
  of essential amino acids lysine (Lys), threonine (Thr), isoleucine (Ile) and methionine
  (Met). Lys is subject to catabolism into allysine and Acetyl-CoA or used for biosynthesis
  of Pipecolic acid (Pip) required for the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) response
  in plants. Dashed arrows represent enzymatic reactions with the generic enzyme names
  next to each arrow. An arrow interrupted by a double dash indicates multiple yet
  not further specified (bio)chemical reactions. Full lines represent negative feedback
  regulation. Asp: L-asapartate; Asp℗: L-aspartyl-4-phosphate; ASA: L-aspartate-β-semialdehyde;
  HTPA: 4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate; LL-DAP: L,L-diaminopimelate; meso-DAP:
  meso-diaminopimelate; Acetyl-CoA: S-acetyl Coenzyme A; P2C: Δ1-piperideine-2-carboxylic
  acid; NHP: N-hydroxypipecolic acid; OPH: O-phosphohomoserine; AK: aspartate kinase;
  ASADH: aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; DHDPS: 4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate
  synthase; DHDPR: dihydrodipicolinate reductase; LL-DAP-AT: LL-diaminopimelate aminotransferase;
  DAPE: diaminopimelate epimerase; DAPDC: diaminopimelate decarboxylase; LKR/SDH:
  lysine ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase; ALD1: AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE
  RESPONSE PROTEIN1; SARD4: SAR DEFICIENT 4; FMO1: FLAVIN-DEPENDENT MONOOXYGENASE1;
  HSDH: homoserine dehydrogenase; HK: homoserine kinase; TS: threonine synthase.'
