figure_title: Effect of DON on the cGAS–STING signaling pathway after Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
  B10 pretreatment.
caption: 'Effect of DON on the cGAS–STING signaling pathway after Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
  B10 pretreatment. The data for each assay were analyzed using a one-way analysis
  of variance (ANOVA). The data were expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3). Compared
  with the control group, * p < 0.05 indicated a significant difference and ** p <
  0.01 indicated a very significant difference. Compared with the DON group, # p <
  0.05 indicated a significant difference and ## p < 0.01 indicated a very significant
  difference'
