figure_title: ADAM17 (p.D647N) variant decreases its protein stability owing to enhanced
  auto-ubiquitination
caption: (A) Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of ADAM17 in
  patients’ hair follicles (HFs) was significantly lower than that in normal controls.
  Scale bar, 300 μm (n = 8 biological replicates of normal controls; n = 8 technical
  replicates of patient III:1). (B) ADAM17 protein level in the scalp tissues of patients
  was lower than that in the controls. (n = 6 biological replicates of controls; n
  = 6 technical replicates of patient III:1.) (C) No significant alteration detected
  in the mRNA levels of ADAM17. (n = 4 biological replicates of controls; n = 4 technical
  replicates of patient III:1.) (D) Adam17 protein level in HFs of Adam17D647N/D674N
  mice was lower than that in wild-type (WT) mice. Left scale bar, 100 μm; right scale
  bar, 50 μm. (n = 28–32 technical replicates.) (E) Adam17 protein level in skin tissues
  was significantly reduced in Adam17D647N/D674N mice compared with the WT mice. (n
  = 3 biological replicates.) (F) No significant changes were observed in the mRNA
  levels of Adam17 between ADAM17D647N/D674N and WT mice. (n = 6 biological replicates.)
  (G) Cycloheximide (CHX) chase analysis showed that ADAM17 (p.D674N) mutation induced
  rapid degradation of ADAM17 in HaCaT cells. (H) ADAM17 (p.D647N) mutation resulted
  in heightened degradation of ADAM17 though proteasome pathway in HaCaT cells. (I)
  ADAM17 (p.D647N) mutation had no bearing on the degradation of ADAM17 through the
  autophagy pathway in HaCaT cells. (J) ADAM17 (p.D647N) mutation resulted in heightened
  ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ADAM17 via the proteasomal pathway.
  All experiments were repeated 3 times. Results were expressed as mean ± SD; *P <
  0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; unpaired 2-tailed t test (B and C); 1-way ANOVA
  (E and F); Mann-Whitney test (A)
