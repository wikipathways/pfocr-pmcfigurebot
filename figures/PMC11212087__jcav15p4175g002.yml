caption: Prognostically relevant metabolic pathway-associated subtypes identified
  by consensus clustering in TCGA COAD/READ cohort. (A) The consensus matrix heat
  map categorizes CRC patients into 3 clusters. (B) Survival curves (overall survival,
  OS, and progression-free survival, PFS) demonstrate prognostic differences among
  the three subtypes. (C) Scatter plot illustrates the two-dimensional mapping of
  samples from the three subtypes based on PCA analysis. (D) Box plots display the
  tumor purity and stromal score of the three subtypes calculated using ESTIMATE.
  (E) Heatmap shows the differential expression of 21 metabolic-related pathways among
  the three subtypes. (F) Box plots represent the immune infiltration of ten cell
  types obtained from MCPcounter analysis. (G) Box plots depict the expression levels
  of immune checkpoint markers LAG3 and PDCD1 across the three subtypes
