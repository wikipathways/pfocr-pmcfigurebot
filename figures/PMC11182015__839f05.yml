caption: Pharmacological perturbation of cellular NAD+ levels affects MDH2's RNA binding.
  (A) Scheme of the salvage synthesis pathway for NAD+ showing the steps targeted
  by NAM and FK866 treatment, respectively. (B) Changes in cellular NAD(H) levels
  were measured after 48 h of treatment. (C) PNK assay to assess MDH2's RNA binding
  on alteration of cellular NAD(H) levels. Black arrows indicate the expected molecular
  mass of mature MDH2. (D) Quantification of RNA binding (PNK signal) of MDH2 after
  NAM/FK866 treatment. Data are reported as mean Â± SD, number of experiments n = 3,
  individual P-values as calculated by ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple
  comparison test correction.
