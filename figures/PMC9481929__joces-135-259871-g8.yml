caption: A graphical model showing mechanism through which RSV infection induces epithelial
  barrier dysfunction. RSV infection disrupts the epithelial barrier via attenuating
  the cortactin/Rap1 signaling pathway and depolymerizing F-actin. In RSV-infected
  epithelial cells, the protein level of cortactin reduces, which in turn attenuates
  the activity of the Rap1/Rac1 signaling pathway and leads to F-actin depolymerization.
  Destabilization of the actin network finally results in disrupted structure and
  increased permeability of the airway epithelial barrier through disassembly of the
  AJC, which is extensively associated with the F-actin network. These RSV-induced
  barrier dysfunctions will be mitigated via activation of Rap1 signaling by Epac
  activator 8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP-AM or F-actin stabilization by jasplakinolide. This
