caption: 'Effect of GA on the MAPK signaling pathwayCaco-2 cells were treated with
  5 μg/mL GA for 24 h and then incubated with 10 μg/mL LPS for another 4 h for subsequent
  experiments. (A) Western blot analysis was used to measure the protein expressions
  of p38 and p-p38. Quantification of the p-p38/p38 ratio. (B) The protein expression
  levels of JNK and p-JNK. Quantification of the p-JNK/JNK ratio. (C) The protein
  expression levels of ERK and p-ERK. Quantification of the p-ERK/ERK ratio. Data
  are shown as the mean±SEM, n=3. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 compared to the control. #P<0.05
  and ##P<0.01 compared to the LPS group. GA: gallic acid.'

  suppressing the activation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway.
