caption: The involvement of OGT in hepatic cellular stress. (1) In the presence of
  adequate glucose, insulin activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to the phosphorylation
  of ULK1 on Ser757 to inhibit hepatic autophagy. In the deficiency of glucose, glucagon
  releases Ca2+ to activate CaMKII, leading to the phosphorylation of OGT, which can
  activate the AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 on Ser317, Ser555, and Ser777
  to promote hepatic autophagy. (2) O-GlcNAcylation can exert anti-apoptotic effects
  by inhibiting CHOP expression or promoting HSP27 expression. In ER stress, phosphorylated
  eIF2α is modified by O-GlcNAcylation to reduce CHOP expression and ultimately inhibit
  apoptosis. In contrast, O-GlcNAcylation modification can allow HSP27 to enter the
  nucleus, thus promoting HCC proliferation. (3) Phosphorylated RIPK3 recruits and
  phosphorylates MLKL, leading to necroptosis. O-GlcNAcylation promotes RIPK3 degradation
  and suppresses necroptosis. Similarly, O-GlcNAcylation of HNF4α also reduces self-phosphorylation
  to terminate LR. (4) OGT can activate AKT to help the survival of hepatocytes at
  a low temperature. AKT can increase Bcl-2 expression and maintain mitochondrial
  membrane integrity; it also can activate AS160, GSK3β, and PFKFB2 to promote glucose-related
  metabolism. (5) O-GlcNAcylation reduces the NRF2 activity induced by APAP, reduces
  GSH levels, and promotes liver injury
