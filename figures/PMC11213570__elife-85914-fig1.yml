figure_title: Analysis of a new cohort shows an IFN-rich environment in non-lesional
  DLE skin
caption: (A–H) Microarray analysis of gene expression from non-lesional skin of DLE
  (n=7, this manuscript), lesional DLE (n=7), psoriasis patients (n=17), and healthy
  controls (n=13) (). In (A, D–F), analyses include lesional DLE or both lesional
  and psoriasis samples. (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) of patient samples
  using top 500 genes. (B) Differentially expressed pathways in control and non-lesional
  DLE skin were determined using QuSAGE pathway analysis against Molecular Signatures
  Database (MSigDB). (C) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes. Genes from
  IFN-α/β (red), IFN-γ (blue) pathways, and IRF transcription factors (green) are
  marked. (D) Heatmap of z-score transformed gene expression in the IFN-α/β signaling
  pathway. (E–H) Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) of gene sets relevant to lupus
  (), with (G–H) comparing only control and non-lesional skin. (F, H) GSVA using gene
  sets comprising specific IFN subtypes. (E–H) *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001
  by unpaired t-test.
