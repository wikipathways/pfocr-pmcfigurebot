caption: Transcriptomics of SAP mice and up-regulation of PKP2 expression in SAP mice.
  (A and B) Scatter plots and heat maps of RNA-seq data from the pancreas of mice
  in the control group and SAP group (n = 3/group) revealed an up-regulation of PKP2
  expression in the SAP group compared to the control group (A), along with differential
  gene GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis conducted on both
  groups (B). (C) Immunohistochemical staining of PKP2 in the pancreatic vascular
  endothelium was conducted using each group of mice (n = 6/group; data represent
  the results of three independent experiments). Scale = 100 µm. (D) The protein and
  mRNA levels of PKP2 in the pancreas of mice were measured in both the control group
  and SAP group, followed by quantitative analysis (n = 6/group; data represent the
  results of three independent experiments). (E) The protein levels and quantitative
  analysis of PKP2, ZO-1, Ve-cadherin, β-catenin, occludin, and claudin1 were assessed
  in HUVECs from both the control group and the LPS group (data represent the results
  of three independent experiments). The GAPDH protein was utilized as a control in
  both experiments (D and E). (F) qRT-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA levels
  of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, after LPS stimulation (data
  represent the results of three independent experiments). (G) mRNA levels of PKP2,
  IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were determined in control and cerulein-treated 266–6 cells
  (data represent the results of three independent experiments). *p < 0.05, **p <
  0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
