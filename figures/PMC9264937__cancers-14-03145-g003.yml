caption: 'p53 isoforms modulate the p53-mediated cellular activities. Different cellular
  stresses such as ER stress, cell contact, DNA damage, oncogene expression, and oxidative
  stress activate the p53 signaling pathway. The TP53 gene produces multiple isoforms:
  p53α, p53β, p53γ, Δ40p53α/β/γ, Δ133p53α/β/γ, and Δ160p53α/β/γ. Isoforms Δ40p53,
  Δ133p53, and Δ160p53 have been reported to affect biological activities such as
  cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, and DNA DAB repair by inducing (green
  line) or repressing (red line) p53 target gene expression. Furthermore, p53 isoforms
  can regulate the expression of p53 target genes either directly (solid red and green
  line) or indirectly (dash red and green line). 14-3-3σ is a target gene of p53,
  and it induces cell cycle arrest. p53 can induce senescence by transactivating its
  target genes p21 and miR-34a. Activating p53 target genes such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
  inhibits apoptosis, while p53 can induce apoptosis by activating pro-apoptotic proteins
  such as Bax and PIDD. Activating several p53 target genes such as RAD51, RAD52,
  and LIG4 contributes to DNA DSB repair.'
