figure_title: Single-cell metabolic pathway analysis in spike-specific CD3–CD4+ T
  cells
caption: (A) Overview of cell metabolism and key metabolic proteins targeted by flow
  cytometry. (B) PBMCs were stimulated or not with spike peptide mix for 16 hours.
  The expression level (MFI) of key metabolic proteins was analyzed in spike-specific
  (CD154+CD137+) CD3+CD4+ versus CD3–CD4+ T cells versus nonspecific CD154–CD137–CD3+CD4+
  “bulk” control T cells within the same sample. Histograms (upper and lower left)
  show exemplary expression characteristics in the 3 subsets for ACAC and GLUT1. n
  = 11; statistical analyses were performed using paired 1-way ANOVA (ACAC, CPT1a,
  G6PD, ATP5a, LDH) or Friedman test (IDH2, GLUT1, HK2). Where applicable, graphs
  show means ± SD
