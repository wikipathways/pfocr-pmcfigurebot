caption: ATFS-1 inhibits activation of the MAPKmt pathway upstream of PMK-3. (A) Relative
  mRNA quantification of endogenous tbb-6 gene expression levels in wt and atfs-1(gk3094)
  loss-of-function mutants, or in wt and lonp-1(ko) animals subjected to RNAi against
  atfs-1. (B) Representative microscopy images and GFP fluorescence quantification
  of the tbb-6p::gfp reporter in wt, lonp-1(ko), pmk-3(ok169) and lonp-1(ko);pmk-3(ok169)
  worms subjected to atfs-1(RNAi). Experiments were performed on 1-day-old adult worms
  grown on NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 or with E. coli HT115 bacteria transformed
  with the indicated RNAi construct (and empty vector as a control) at 20 °C. Scale
  bar indicates 100 µm. Values are presented as means ± SEM, and asterisks denote
  statistical significance assessed with an unpaired Student’s t-test or with a two-way
  ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey’s test, ** p ≤ 0.01, **** p ≤ 0.0001
