caption: 'Overview of the results from the comparative transcriptomics and proteomics
  analysis on model lymphoma cell lines +/−N3a. (A): Venn diagrams of the overlapping
  deregulated mRNAs and deregulated proteins demonstrate the cell-specific effect
  of N3a on the lymphoma proteome and transcriptome. Bar diagrams show the exact number
  of proteins deregulated (in blue), up-regulated (in red) and down-regulated (in
  green) in cHL and NHLs. (B): The acquired data were hierarchically clustered, displaying
  in heat-maps the differential expression of mRNAs/proteins +/−N3a (FDR-adjusted,
  p-value < 0.05). Functional annotation analysis was combined with mRNA/protein expression
  level data to identify the top-GO-term enrichment categories (BP, CC and MF) relevant
  to N3a’s effect in both omics analyses. Columns were clustered according to top-ranked-categories
  of interest, and rows were clustered according to the lymphoma-subtype. Presence
  and enrichment levels were color-coded in a red-black gradient representing the
  −log10 (adjusted p-value) (red: presence in treated vs. control; black: missing
  value), with intensity proportional to presence/enrichment. (C): Selected pathways
  with a significant enrichment in proteins affected by N3a treatment indicating an
  up- or down-regulation of these pathways'
