figure_title: Effects of p,pʹ-bis-[4-chlorophenyl]-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) on
  the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB)/IκB expression levels.
caption: Effects of p,pʹ-bis-[4-chlorophenyl]-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) on the protein
  kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
  activated B cells (NF-κB)/IκB expression levels. The study investigated the effects
  of p,pʹ-DDT exposure on the AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
  signaling pathways (A, B, C) and on the levels of NF-κB and IκB proteins (D, E).
  After treatment with p,pʹ-DDT (at 10, 100, 1,000, or 1,000 pg/mL+fulvestrant [ICI]),
  the cells were harvested for analysis. Western blotting was employed to measure
  the protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK,
  NF-κB, and IκB. β-Actin served as the loading control for these assays, and the
  protein levels were normalized to β-actin for quantitative analysis. The measurements
  are presented as relative fold changes in comparison to the control cells. These
  results represent the mean±standard error of the mean, based on data from three
  independent experiments. a)p-values that denote statistical significance when compared
  to the control cells at the corresponding time point, as determined by the Student
  t-test (p<0.05); b)p<0.005
