  and a 1:4 ratio (L4-PtNPs) of H2PtCl6 to N.
caption: Platinum nanoparticles green-synthesized with a 1:1 ratio (L1-PtNPs) and
  a 1:4 ratio (L4-PtNPs) of H2PtCl6 to N. tetragona (L4-PtNPs) shown to promote collagen
  I by activating the TGF β/Smad signaling pathway. (a–e) Effects of L1-PtNPs and
  L4-PtNPs on collagen I, TGF β, Smad3, and pSmad3 expression in HFF-1 cells. (f)
  Effects of L1-PtNPs and L4-PtNPs on HFF-1 cell viability. Data are represented as
  the mean ± standard deviation from replicate experiments. * (p < 0.05), ** (p <
  0.01), and *** (p < 0.001) represent different levels of statistical significance.
