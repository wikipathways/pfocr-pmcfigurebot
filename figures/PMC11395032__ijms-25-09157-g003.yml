caption: GO biological process enrichment chart of DEGs between well-watered (WW)
  and soil-drying (SD) conditions. The outermost circle of the image represents the
  term name enriched with DEGs. From outer to inner, the first layer is the GO term
  number, layer 2 is the number of genes in the GO term, and layer 3 shows the numbers
  of up- and down-regulated genes in the GO term. The color range from white to purple
  represents the magnitude of significance, and the gray label indicates the proportion
  of differentially expressed genes in the enriched pathway to the total enriched
  genes
