caption: Proposed mechanism of compound 6b for promoting apoptosis of HepG2 cells.
  To enhance the anti-hepatoma activity of AD-2, the amino acid derivatives of AD-2
  were introduced in the previous work. The amino acid derivative 6b with high efficacy
  and low toxicity was screened by MTT assay. It has an excellent ability to resist
  the proliferation of hepatoma cell HepG2. The mechanism study found that 6b could
  destroy the cytoskeleton, regulate the MDM2/p53 signaling pathway, increase the
  expression level of Bax/Bcl-2, and activate Caspase3/8 system, thus causing apoptosis,
  which was also verified by flow cytometry
