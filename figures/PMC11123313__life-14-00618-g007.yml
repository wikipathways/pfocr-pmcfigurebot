caption: Correlation heat map of alkaloid content and conversion in D. stramonium.
  This heat map represents the correlation coefficients among various variables, illustrating
  the relationships within the biosynthetic pathway of D. stramonium alkaloids. The
  color’s intensity correlates with the association’s strength, whereas darker shades
  signify stronger correlations. Notably, the conversion of hyoscyamine to scopolamine
  is depicted, highlighting a significant correlation between the hyoscyamine content
  and the leaf tissues, as well as the root tissues, at 0 µM MJ concentration—indicative
  of lower scopolamine production. In contrast, root tissues treated with 300 µM and
  600 µM MJ concentrations exhibit the highest scopolamine production, as reflected
  by their strong correlation with scopolamine levels on the heat map
