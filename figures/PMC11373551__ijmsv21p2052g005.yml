caption: The detection and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites.
  5A showing the analysis of metabolomic data showcasing differentially expressed
  metabolites. The plot differentiates between up-regulated and down-regulated metabolites
  based on log2 fold change and statistical significance, providing a comprehensive
  view of metabolic alterations. 5B represents the interaction network analysis of
  differential metabolites, 5C shows the results of pathway enrichment analysis for
  differential metabolites; 5D illustrates the distribution of core differential metabolites
