caption: Involvement of IL-1 beta in the inflammatory response in patients with food
  allergy (FA) and atopic dermatitis (AD). There is an increased concentration of
  IL-1 beta in (A) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity along the Th2 pathway, similar to
  the acute phase of AD. There are two possible sources of IL-1 beta. The first is
  damaged skin. In response to the contact of food allergens with damaged tissue,
  IL-1 beta is released, leading to the increased production of Th2 cells. On the
  other hand, IL-1 beta is produced and released by recruited eosinophils that migrate
  to inflammatory sites in response to type 2 cytokines, e.g., IL-4 []. Increased
  concentration of IL-1 beta leads to the polarization of naive Th cells into the
  Th17 lineage. The resulting Th17 lymphocytes release the cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F,
  which affect both the Th2 cells and the eosinophils. In addition to IL-1 beta, eosinophils
  release, among others, IL-25 (IL-17E), which enhances the production of Th2 inflammatory
  mediators. The interaction of Th2 cells, eosinophils, and Th17 via their cytokines
  drives the inflammatory loop. The inflammatory loop is marked with a dashed red
  line. IL-1 beta is the major initiator of the inflammatory loop cascade (A). Otherwise,
  eosinophils are able to switch between the Th2 and Th1 pathway via IL-12. It is
  the site of transition for (B) delayed food allergy along the Th1 pathway, similar
  to chronic AD. Eos–eosinophil; Th2–type 2 helper T cell; Th17–type 17 helper T cell;
  Th1–type 1 helper T cell.
