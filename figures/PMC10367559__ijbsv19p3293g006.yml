caption: UBE2C is required for ZIC2-induced AKT/mTOR signaling activation and ccRCC
  malignant phenotype. (A) UBE2C was overexpressed on the basis of ZIC2 knockdown.
  Overexpression of UBE2C partially rescued the decreased (B-C) proliferation ability,
  (D) colony formation ability, (E) migration, (F) invasion and (H) EMT ability caused
  by ZIC2 knockdown, and also partially rescued (G) the G2/M cell cycle arrest and
  (I) AKT/mTOR signaling pathway inhibition. (J) Schematic of the mechanism of this
  study
