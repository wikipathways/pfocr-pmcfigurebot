figure_title: Single-cell transcriptomics of midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) cells
  in CFA-induced chronic inflammatory pain model
caption: a, Overview of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experimental design
  to define the mechanism of action (MOA) of ApAP and SRP-001. Left hind paws of Sprague-Dawley
  rats were injected with complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) to induce local inflammation
  and a chronic pain state, or vehicle (0.9% saline). They were then dosed with either
  ApAP or SRP-001 (100 mg/kg). Periaqueductal gray (PAG) midbrain region was dissected
  to isolate cell nuclei for sequencing library generation using the 10x Genomics
  Chromium platform. Single cell data were embedded after dimensionality reduction
  using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Cell clusters were annotated,
  followed by differential gene expression analysis. b, UMAP plots showing the distribution
  of annotated cell clusters generated by the workflow of Seurat across 4 different
  samples – Vehicle, CFA_Veh, CFA_ApAP, and CFA_SRP-001, respectively. c, Heatmap
  of top 40 canonical pathways for neuronal clusters across samples – CFA_Veh, CFA_ApAP,
  and CFA_SRP-001 with the comparisons between them as follows – Vehicle vs CFA_Vehicle,
  CFA_Vehicle vs CFA_ApAP, and CFA_ApAP vs CFA_SRP-001. The pathways shown in the
  heatmap were predicted using Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool from the
  normalized matrix after comparing the differentially expressed genes between the
  neuronal clusters of the samples that were compared against each other. The heatmap
  shows that when CFA_Vehicle is compared to Vehicle, there is upregulation of several
  genes that are predicted to affect cellular signaling related to these pathways
  highlighted in the heatmap, and when CFA_ApAP and CFA_SRP-001 are compared to CFA_Vehicle,
  there is downregulation of those upregulated pathways in both cases, with more downregulation
  for CFA_SRP-001 than CFA_ApAP. Similarly, there is predicted downregulation of mitochondrial
  dysfunction and Granzyme A signaling pathways for CFA_Vehicle, which are restored
  by CFA_ApAP and CFA_SRP-001 with CFA_SRP-001downregulating more based on the color
  intensity of the heatmap
