caption: Deregulated E2F activity, which activates tumor suppressor genes, specifically
  exists in cancer cells. Upon dysfunction of the RB pathway, deregulated E2F1 activates
  the Arf gene to protect cells from tumorigenesis. However, the p53 pathway is also
  disabled in cancer cells, enabling cancer cells to survive, leaving deregulated
  E2F1 activity that specifically exists in cancer cells. Red crosses on RB, ARF and
  p53 indicate their dysfunction, and that on dashed line indicates p53 cannot suppress
  tumor growth
