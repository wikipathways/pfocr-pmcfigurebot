caption: 'pu-MEB induces apoptosis and S phase arrest to reduce cancer cell growth.
  (A) To perform flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic cells, HeLa cells were treated
  to pu-MEB at a dose of 100 μg/ml for 2 days. Apoptotic cell populations are shown
  by the green square. **P < 0.01 versus control group (DMSO), student''s t-test.
  Means ± S.D., n = 3. (B) Effect of pu-MEB on the expression levels of proteins that
  initiate the caspase cascade and induce apoptosis. Compared with the DMSO control
  group, full-length caspase 9 decreased and cleaved caspase 9 increased in the pu-MEB
  group. (C) To perform flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle, HeLa cells were treated
  to pu-MEB at a dose of 100 μg/ml for 2 days. **P < 0.01 versus control group (DMSO),
  student''s t-test. Means ± S.D., n = 3. (D) Effect of pu-MEB on the expression levels
  of proteins that play important roles in the cell cycle pathway: p53, phospho-p53,
  MEK, phospho-MEK'
