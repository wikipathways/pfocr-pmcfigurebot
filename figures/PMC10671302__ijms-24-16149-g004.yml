  interaction with different receptors: The interaction of CHI3L1 from different sources
  with various receptor sets activates signaling pathways such as JNK, ERK, and PI3K,
  promoting the polarization and infiltration of M2 macrophages. This, in turn, leads
  to angiogenesis and tumor metastasis'
