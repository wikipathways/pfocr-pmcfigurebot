caption: Effect of angiogenesis inhibitors on bone marrow cells from female C57BL/6N
  mice. (a) Schematic illustration of ex‐vivo experimental design. (b) Effect of pazopanib
  (VEGF inhibitor) on the inhibition of tEVs‐induced bone marrow cell proliferation.
  (c) Effect of pioglitazone (osteopontin inhibitor) on the inhibition of tEVs‐induced
  bone marrow cell proliferation. (d) Effect of epicatechin (ADAMTS‐1 inhibitor) on
  the inhibition of tEVs‐induced bone marrow cell proliferation. (e) Effect of rmTFPI
  (tissue factor pathway inhibitor) on the inhibition tEVs‐induced bone marrow cell
  proliferation. The cells were treated either inhibitors alone or with inhibitors
  in combination with 5e9 tEVs. The data are presented as means (±SD, n = 3). Statistical
  significance (*p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001) between experimental
  groups was calculated with using one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with each
  value Tukey's multiple comparisons test.
