caption: Dynamic changes of T cell subsets in HCC and immune pathway studies. (A)
  UMAP plot showing the difference in the distribution of T cell subpopulations in
  HCC and PC, which were categorized into Naive T cells, Cytotoxic T cells, Treg,
  Unknown, and Exhausted T cells. (B) Bar graph demonstrating the percentage of T
  cell subpopulations in the tissues of HCC and PC. (C) UMAP plot presenting the developmental
  trajectory tree of T cell subpopulations. T cells are differentiated into various
  subpopulations starting with Naive T cells. (D) Bar graph presenting the percentage
  of T cell subpopulations in the combined HCC and PC samples. The percentage of Cytotoxic
  T cells in HCC was significantly decreased, while Naive T cells, Treg, and Exhausted
  T cells were significantly increased. (E) Proposed temporal changes of the top 10
  genes ranked by the Moran Index with cell development. (F) Network heatmap showing
  the signaling pathways of T cell subpopulations. (G) Input versus output signal
  intensity. Output signals are dominated by Exhausted T cells, whereas output signals
  are dominated by Treg emitted (H) Bubble diagram showing differences in signaling
  intensity of specific pathways (I) Differences in changes of TNFRSF14 (HVEM) in
  PC and HCC during the course of following cell development. (J) Differences in CD4
  changes in PC and HCC during development with cells. (K) Single-cell GSEA. natural
  killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway downregulation;
  Glycolysis -Gluconeogenesis and Oxidative phosphorylation were upregulated in T
  cell subsets.
