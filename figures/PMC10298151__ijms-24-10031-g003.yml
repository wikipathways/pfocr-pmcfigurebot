caption: The activation of the D2R β-arrestin pathway promotes GRK2 ubiquitination.
  (A) HEK 293 cells producing [Gprot]D2R or [βarr]D2R were transfected with plasmids
  encoding GFP-GRK2 and FLAG-Mdm2. The cells were stimulated with either Veh or 10
  μM DA for 2 min. FLAG beads were used to immunoprecipitate cell lysates. Co-IP/Lysate
  and IP were immunoblotted via the use of GFP (1:1000 dilution) and FLAG (1:1000
  dilution) antibodies, respectively. The data represent the outcomes of three independent
  investigations with comparable results. ** p < 0.01 compared with the Veh group
  (n = 3). (B) HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding [Gprot]D2R or
  [βarr]D2R, HA-Ub, and FLAG-GRK2. The cells were treated for 2 min with either a
  vehicle or 10 μM DA. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates using FLAG beads. Antibodies
  against HA (1:1000 dilution) and FLAG (1:1000 dilution) were used to immunoblot
  Co-IP and IP. ** p < 0.01 compared with the Veh group (n = 3). (C) HEK 293 cells
  producing D2R were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-Ub and FLAG-GRK2. The cells
  were stimulated with either 10 μM MLS1547 or 1 μM UNC9994 for 2 min. Immunoprecipitation
  of cell lysates using FLAG beads. Antibodies against HA (1:1000 dilution) and FLAG
  (1:1000 dilution) were used to immunoblot Co-IP and IP. * p < 0.05 compared with
  the Veh group (n = 3). (D) HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding
  D2R and FLAG-GRK2. Cells were prestimulated with 50 μg/mL cycloheximide for 1 h,
  followed by 10 μM MLS1547 or 1 μM UNC9994 treatment for 0–2 h. Cell lysates were
  immunoblotted using FLAG (1:1000 dilution) or β-actin (1:2000 dilution) antibodies.
  “0 min” groups were normalized to 100%. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 compared with
  the Veh group (n = 3). (E) CTRL-KD and Mdm2-KD cells producing D2R were transfected
  with plasmids encoding GRK2. The pretreatment of cells with 50 μg/mL cycloheximide
  for 1 h was followed with treatment with 1 μM UNC9994 for 0–2 h. The immunoblotting
  of cell lysates with antibodies against GRK2 (1:2000 dilution) or β-actin (1:2000
  dilution) was performed. “0 min” groups were normalized to 100%. * p < 0.05, ***
  p < 0.001 compared with the Veh/CTRL-KD group (n = 3)
