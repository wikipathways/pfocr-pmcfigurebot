caption: The top twenty enriched KEGG pathways based on the DEGs in two pairwise groups.
  (a) CKAC-vs-AC; (b) CKMT-vs-MT; (c) AC-vs-MT. Each circle in the figure represented
  a KEGG pathway, where the y-axis denoted the pathway name and the x-axis represented
  the enrichment factor, which was the ratio of the proportion of annotated genes
  in DEGs to the proportion of annotated genes in all genes for that pathway. A larger
  enrichment factor indicated a more significant enrichment level of DEGs in that
  pathway. The color of the circle represented the p-value, which was the value after
  multiple hypothesis testing correction. A smaller p-value indicated a more reliable
  significance of the enrichment of DEGs in that pathway. The size of the circle represented
  the number of enriched genes in the pathway, where a larger circle indicated more
  genes in the pathway
