  and invasion by alkaloids.
caption: 'Regulation of thyroid cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and
  invasion by alkaloids. Uncontrolled proliferation and inhibited apoptosis are two
  major events for tumorigenesis. Therefore, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell
  proliferation are important strategies to prevent tumor progression. Alkaloids can
  promote apoptosis through activation of either the extrinsic (death receptor) or
  the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Alkaloids inhibit cell proliferation via
  several pathways: TRPV1, JAK-STAT, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, SHH, WNT/frizzled as
  shown in the figure. Inhibiting cell migration and invasion is crucial to prevent
  metastasis at other sites. Some alkaloids inhibit cell migration and invasion by
  lowering matrix metalloproteinases expression, upregulating miR-192-5p (tumor suppressor)
  or inhibiting miR-182-5p'
