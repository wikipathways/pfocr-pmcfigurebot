caption: 'Overview of TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β signaling is transduced through
  2 pathways: canonical (SMAD dependent) and noncanonical (SMAD independent). Signal
  transduction initiates by binding TGF-β to TβRII, which recruits and transphosphorylates
  TβRI. Either canonical or noncanonical signaling pathways can subsequently be activated
  by the TβRI–TβRII complex. After phosphorylation, TβRI becomes activated, then activates
  the canonical pathway through phosphorylation of R-SMADs (SMAD2 and SMAD3). R-SMADs
  form heteromeric complexes with Co-SMAD (SMAD4) and translocate to the nucleus,
  where they bind to site-specific recognition sequences (SBEs) and regulate the expression
  of TGF-β-signaling-pathway target genes. R-SMADs modulate the biogenesis of microRNA
  (miRNA) by promoting the processing of primary miRNA into precursor miRNA in the
  nucleus. mG, 5′ capping of messenger RNA (mRNA); AAAAA, 3′ polyadenylation of mRNA.
  In noncanonical pathways, TGF-β signaling activates SMAD-independent pathways such
  as the renin–angiotensin system (RAS)/ERK, PI3K/AKT, JNK and p38, NF-κB, and Rho.
  TGF-β signaling can be influenced by other pathways (e.g., RAS, Wnt, Hedgehog, interferon,
  TNF, Notch)'
