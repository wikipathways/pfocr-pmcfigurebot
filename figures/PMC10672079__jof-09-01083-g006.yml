caption: Effect of blocking the autophagy pathway on the number of peroxisomes. (A)
  Peroxisomes in mycelia. ATG1 was knocked out in the background of PH-1/FgPex14:GFP,
  ΔFgPex4/FgPex14:GFP, and ΔFgPex22-like/FgPex14:GFP strains to obtain the double
  knockout mutants ΔATG1/FgPex14:GFP, ΔΔATG1/FgPex4/FgPex14:GFP, and ΔΔATG1/FgPex22-like/FgPex14:GFP.
  The six strains were cultured in liquid PDB medium for 24 h, and the distribution
  of peroxisomes was observed under a laser confocal microscope. Scale bar = 5 μm.
  Green represents the peroxisome labeled with GFP, while turquoise represents the
  peroxisome with green fluorescence in the bright field. (B) Trends in the number
  of peroxisomes. The ratio of peroxisome number of ΔATG1/PH-1, ΔΔATG1/FgPex4/ΔFgPex4,
  and ΔΔATG1/FgPex22-like/ΔFgPex22-like was analyzed. Error bars on the histograms
  represent the standard error of three repeated tests. Different letters on the bars
  for each treatment indicate significant difference at p < 0.05 based on the Duncan’s
  multiple range test
