caption: Molecular and cellular mechanisms of TGF-β signaling pathway in GO. TGF-β
  exerts its multifaceted effects on fibrosis and inflammation through both canonical
  and non-canonical signaling pathways. It binds to TGFR2, subsequently activating
  TGFR1. In the canonical pathway, TGFR1 phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, enabling
  their complex formation with Smad4. This complex then translocates to the nucleus,
  initiating transcription of fibrogenic genes. In non-canonical signaling pathways,
  TGF-β promotes fibrosis and ECM deposition by activating mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathways, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, RhoA-GTPase pathways,
  Wnt/β-catenin pathways, and NOX4 pathways. In the MAPK pathways, phosphorylated
  p38/JNK also interacts with the canonical pathway by activating Smad2 and Smad3,
  c-Jun, and AP-1. Additionally, in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, Wnt ligands bind to
  the FZD and LRP5/6 receptors, leading to increased levels of β-catenin. β-catenin
  then translocates to the nucleus to induce target gene expression. The blue arrow
  indicates an activating effect, while the red T-bar signifies an inhibitory effect
