caption: The associations between m6A regulators and the genes of Wnt signaling pathway
  (A), cellular response to DNA damage (B), regulation of cell cycle (C), and tight
  junction (D). (E) The impact of m6A regulators on the DEGs within Wnt signaling
  pathway, regulation of cell cycle, cellular response to DNA damage, and tight junction.
  (F) The level of m6A modification on SFRP1, CCND1, and FOXM1 mRNA transcripts visualized
  by IGV. The interactions of oridonin with m6A regulators of FMR1 protein (G) and
  HNRNPA2B1 protein (H). (I) Molecular dynamics simulation between FMR1 protein and
  oridonin
