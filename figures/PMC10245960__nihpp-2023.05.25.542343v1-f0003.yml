figure_title: Genome-wide CRISPR screen in the NPC lines identify functional genes
  for kidney development and disease
caption: '(A) Schematic diagram illustrates the workflow of genome-wide CRISPR knockout
  screen in mNPC lines.(B) Box plot showing the distribution of beta scores of all
  genes or essential genes in two CRISPR screen replicates. Boxes, 25th to 75th percentiles;
  whiskers, 1st to 99th percentiles.(C) MAGeCKFlute scatterplots of beta scores showing
  common positively and negatively selected genes from two CRISPR screen replicates.(D)
  Top 11 enriched ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) Canonical Pathways from CRISPR
  screen replicate #1.(E–I) MAGeCKFlute scatterplots of beta scores from two CRISPR
  screen replicates showing FGF signaling related genes (E), NPC signature genes that
  encode nucleus-localizing proteins (F), Wilms tumor-related genes (G), CAKUT-related
  genes (H), and genes that regulate epigenetic mechanisms (I).(J and K) Normalized
  read counts of 4 individual sgRNAs targeting Kmt2a (J) and Kat6a (K) at the start
  and the end of the CIRPSR screen.(L and M) Immunofluorescence analyses (L) and quantification
  (M) of the expression of SIX2, PAX2, SALL1, and WT1 in mNPCs after treated with
  KMT2A inhibitor MLL1 (inh), or KAT6A inhibitor WM-1119, for 8 days. Scale bars,
  50 μm.Data are presented as mean ± SD. Each column represents counts from three
  biological replicates (n=3). The significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired
  Student’s t tests; ns, not significant; *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; ***, p<0.001.See
