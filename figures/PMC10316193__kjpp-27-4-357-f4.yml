figure_title: Shikonin modulates the MAPK signaling pathway
caption: 'Groups were divided into five groups: C57BL/6, NOD, NOD + 12.5 mg/kg Shikonin,
  NOD + 25 mg/kg Shikonin, and NOD + 50 mg/kg Shikonin. Western blot was used to examine
  the protein expressions of p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, p-P38, and P38. ***p < 0.001.
  Values are presented as mean ± SD. NOD, non-obese diabetic'
