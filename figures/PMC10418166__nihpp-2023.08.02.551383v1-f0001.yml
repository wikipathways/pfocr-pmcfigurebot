figure_title: Fibroblasts from ILD biopsy have higher TGFβ signaling than fibroblasts
  from ILD explants
caption: (A) Schematic of processing diagnostic lung biopsies of ILD patients. (B)
  Dimensional Reduction Plot of fibroblasts from donor (13,856 cells, n = 13), control
  biopsy (7,724 cells, n = 3), and ILD explant (21,192 cells, n = 26) samples. (C)
  Fibroblast subtype composition by sample type. (D,E) Volcano Plots of differentially
  expressed (D.E.) genes in all fibroblasts from Control Biopsy samples vs Donor samples
  and Control Biopsy samples vs ILD Explant samples, with selected TGFβ-pathway related
  genes labelled. (F) Violin Plot of Selected TGFβ1 related genes in all fibroblasts.
  (G) Single-cell activity of Hallmark TGFβ pathway in all fibroblasts. (H) Heatmap
  of Z-scores from pairwise upstream Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially
  expressed genes from all fibroblasts. Statistical significance was determined by
  2-tailed t-test (C,F,G) and MAST with adjustment for multiple comparisons (D,E)
