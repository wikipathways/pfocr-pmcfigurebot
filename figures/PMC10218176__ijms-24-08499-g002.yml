caption: 'GPR19 molecular signature is associated with DNA and energy management pathways.
  Using a specific MSigDB C2âˆ’Chemical and Genetic and Perturbations (CGP) database
  that encompasses complex molecular collections of proteins associated with well-characterized
  specific processes, we found that the GPR19 molecular perturbation signature most
  closely matched the PUJANA BRCA1 PCC Network. This suggests a strong potential functional
  relationship between GPR19 and BRCA1-related activity (A). Using a similarity clustering
  process with GeneTrail v3.2 (https://genetrail.bioinf.uni-sb.de/: accessed on 21
  February 2023) a strong local MSigDB-CGP clustering between PUJANA BRCA1 PCC NETWORK,
  PUJANA CHEK2 PCC NETWORK, and the PUJANA ATM PCC NETWORK was found (B)'
