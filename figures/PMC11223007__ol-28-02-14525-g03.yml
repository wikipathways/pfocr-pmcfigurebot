caption: Association between ARID1A and altered proteins involved in the Wnt signaling
  pathway. (A) Interaction network of ARID1A and altered proteins involved in the
  Wnt signaling pathway constructed using GeneMANIA. (B) Heatmap of the HR of TCF7L1
  and ZNRF3 for the overall survival of patients with COAD, created using GEPIA2.
  The framed block indicates a significant prognostic value. (C) Kaplan-Meier curve
  for overall survival of patients with COAD with different levels of ZNRF3 expression,
  plotted using GEPIA2. (D) Correlation between the expression of ARID1A and ZNRF3
  in COAD, analyzed using GEPIA2. ARID1A, AT-rich interacting domain-containing protein
  1A; TCF7L1, transcription factor 7 like 1; ZNRF3, zinc and ring finger 3; COAD,
  colon adenocarcinoma; GEPIA2, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2;
  HR, hazard ratio; TPM, transcripts per million
