caption: The activation of FAK/AKT signaling pathway by PLST in H460 and H1299 cells.
  (A) Western blotting analysis was performed to determine the association between
  PLST-induced EMT and FAK/AKT signaling pathway. H460 and H1299 cells were transfected
  with EV or PLST OV for 24 h, and treated with nothing or 10 μM PF-573228, as an
  inhibitor of FAK, for 24 h. (B) Western blotting analysis was performed to confirm
  that FAK is involved in PLST-induced EMT signaling pathway. H460 and H1299 cells
  were transfected with NC or siPLST for 48 h, and treated with nothing or 10 μM PF-573228
  for 24 h. These results are the average of three independent experiments. (C) A
  schematic model for the induction of EMT process by PLST in H460 and H1299 cells.
