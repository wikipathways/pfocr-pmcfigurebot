caption: Signaling functions of KBs and KD for anti-apoptosis, antioxidant defense,
  and epigenetic and post-translational modifications. (A) KBs exert beneficial effects
  by inducing anti-apoptotic and antioxidant defenses. KBs and KD protect neurons
  from apoptosis by inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP),
  mt ROS production, and caspase activation. KBs and KD induce antioxidant defenses
  through the SIRT1/2/3, PGC1α, FOXO1/3a, and ERK/CREB/eNOS pathways and acetylation
  of histones, resulting in stress resistance and neuroprotection. The antioxidant
  Nrf2 signaling pathway is activated via acute ROS. (B) KBs and KD exhibit their
  beneficial effects through epigenetic and post-translational modifications of histones
  and non-histone proteins. KBs exert their neuroprotective effects through the SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α
  pathway in a NAD+-dependent manner. Additionally, KBs regulate HDAC and p300 to
  promote acetylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27Ac, Kac). KBs increase brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression by inducing acetylation (Kac), increasing
  trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3, Kme3), decreasing trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3,
  Kme3), reducing ubiquitination at lysine 119 of histone H2A (H2AK119ub, Kub), and
  increasing β-hydroxybutyrylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9bhb, Kbhb). KBs
  also increase the Kbhb of CaMKIIα, thereby reducing CaMKIIα activity and drug addiction.
