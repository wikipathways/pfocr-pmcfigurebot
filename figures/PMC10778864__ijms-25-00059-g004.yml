figure_title: VEGFA regulates the biological behavior of vascular endothelial cells.
caption: VEGFA regulates the biological behavior of vascular endothelial cells. Under
  the stimulation of the upstream signal of HIF-1Î±, MiR-205-5p, and TRAF3IP2, VEGFA
  further activates downstream pathways in vascular endothelial cells, such as ERK1/2,
  PI3K/Akt, FAK, and p38/MAPK, which further regulates the proliferation, migration,
  and apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells
