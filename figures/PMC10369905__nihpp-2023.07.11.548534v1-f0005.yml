  The distributions of drug sensitivity (represented as log IC50s) to (A)
  PIK-93 and (B)
  AKT inhibitor VIII by cancer cell lines grouped according to the mutation status of genes involved in the PI3K pathway. The distribution of drug sensitivity by the cell lines predicted by ResGitDR to be sensitive to the drugs is also shown. (C). Cancer cell lines were clustered using the based on the selected top 50 predictive features from ResGitDR models for 3 anti-PI3K PI3K/MTOR drugs: AKT inhibitor VIII, PIK-93, and GSK690693. The features consist of hidden representations and individual SGAs. The SGAs are represented as binary values. The hidden node values are standardized within the range of 0 to 1. The binary drug responses to each of the three drugs by cell lines are shown. Three red boxes highlight the clusters with enriched responder cell lines (clusters 3, 10, and 11). The mutation status of genes in the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway is shown to illustrate their relationship with respect to drug sensitivity. (D). The connectivity map shows the similarity of the embedding of drugs targeting common pathways. The top 50 important features of the ResGitDR for a drug are used as its embedding. The similarity of embeddings of two drugs is measured with cosine similarity. Molecularly targeted drugs are shown as nodes; an edge is added between a pair of drugs whose embeddings are among the top 5 highest cosine similarities of each other. If drug A is a neighbor of drug B, the arrow direction points from drug B to drug A; a double-arrowed edge indicates that a pair of drugs are mutually among the top 5 neighbors of each other. The thickness of an arrow is proportional to cosine similarity
