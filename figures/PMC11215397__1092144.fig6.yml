caption: 'Loss of Ppm1b impaired the function of hematopoietic stem cells through
  Wnt/b-catenin pathway. (A) Western blot analysis of indicated proteins in purified
  lineage negative cells from Ppm1bCKO and Ppm1bfl/fl mice. (B) Quantification of
  mRNA expression of Ppm1b, cyclin D1 and Myc in cells from (A). 18S ribosomal RNA
  was used as an internal control. (C) Representative confocal images of proximity
  ligation assay between Ppm1b and b-catenin in Lin-Sca1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells. Sorted
  LSK cells from 3 independent Ppm1bCKO and Ppm1bfl/fl mice were stained with indicated
  antibodies separately, and were visualized using a fluorescent microscope. Scale
  bar: 5 μM. (D) Lineage negative cells purified from indicated mice were labeled
  with CFSE, and then the cells were cultured with or without BML-284 (10 nM) for
  48 hours (hr) in vitro. The fluorescence intensity of CFSE of LSK cells was quantified
  by flow cytometry. (E) Ppm-1bCKO and Ppm1bfl/fl mice were treated with BML-284 (5
  mg/kg) or not for 4 days, followed by a single dose injection of 5-FU for another
  7 days. The frequency of LSK cells was determined from indicated mice by flow cytometry
  (N=4). (F) Cell cycles of LSK cells in (E) were analyzed by flow cytometry using
  Hoechst 33342 and Ki67 staining (N=4). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. All P values
  were determined by unpaired two-tailed Student t test. Data are presented as mean
  ± Standard Deviation from 3 independent experiments. See also Online Supplementary
