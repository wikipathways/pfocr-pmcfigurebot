figure_title: The role of HMGB2 in the development of the diseases.
caption: 'The role of HMGB2 in the development of the diseases. Roles of HMGB2 in
  tumor proliferation and metastasis: the protein can promote cancer cell proliferation
  by interacting with HOX10 [132]. It has been shown that HMGB2 mediates the Warburg
  effect by transcriptional regulation of the activity of glycolytic enzymes lactate
  dehydrogenase and fructose bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) [71]. This provides the necessary
  energy for the proliferation of cancer cells. Moreover, HMGB2 can stimulate p53
  or the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [175], activate the AKT signaling pathway through AKT
  phosphorylation and downregulate p21 and p27 expression in cervical cancer [50].
  HMGB2 also plays an important role in the invasion and migration of tumor cells.
  Non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (LncRNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs),
  are closely associated with HMGB2-mediated metastasis [105]. In Kaposi’s sarcoma
  (KS) induced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HMGB2 is upregulated by miR-218-5p,
  mediated by vIRF1/p53 and vIRF1/Lnc-OI5P-AS1 [125]. miR-329 can downregulate HMGB2
  expression within the β-catenin signaling pathway in melanoma, ultimately suppressing
  metastasis [133]. In aging, HMGB2 binds to the promoter region of the SASP gene
  and prevents the recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α), subsequently
  regulating the aging processes [123]. HMGB2 mechanically stabilizes the TOP1cc complex
  and subsequently enhances the binding between cGAS and dsDNA [101]. The HMGB2-dsDNA
  pathway is also reported to be stimulated by rRNA biogenesis. Inhibition of rRNA
  biogenesis can stabilize p53 and suppress HMGB2 expression in a p53-dependent manner
  [124]. Role of HMGB2 in drug resistance: HMGB2 can bind to platinum adducts on DNA
  and activate DNA repair system, leading to chemoresistance to cisplatin [100]. HMGB2
  can bind to the SRC-1 steroid receptor coactivator, and then this complex binds
  to the DEAD-box helicase 18 promoter (DDX18), resulting in tamoxifen resistance
  [140]. It is known that miR-23b-3p can inhibit HMGB2-regulated autophagy and increase
  the sensitivity of gastric cancer (GC) cells to chemotherapy [206]. In addition,
  HMGB1/2 can increase the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide (TMZ)
  therapy by suppressing p53 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) [122]. HMGB2 downregulation
  is marked in yellow boxes, and upregulation is marked in blue boxes'
