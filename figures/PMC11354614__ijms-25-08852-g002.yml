caption: Glucose and stress metabolism. (A) Summary of changed metabolic enzymes in
  glucose metabolism in muscles attached to inflamed tendons, both without (COL) and
  with PEMF treatment (PEMF). (B) Heatmap illustrating the expression profile of significantly
  increased (in red) or decreased (in green) enzymes (ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s test, p-value
  < 0.05) involved in glucose metabolism and stress response pathways. The graphical
  illustration was generated using BioRender (version 4)
