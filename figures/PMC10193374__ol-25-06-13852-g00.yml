caption: (A) In wound healing, CTHRC1 can recruit additional M2 macrophages to the
  wound site to promote skin repair and activate the TGF-β and Notch pathways. DPAGT1
  can regulate the activation of CTHRC1, and CTHRC1 activates the TGF-β pathway; simultaneously,
  there is a key negative feedback loop. The increased phosphorylation level of Smad2/3
  in the TGF-β downstream signaling pathway stimulates the expression of CTHRC1. However,
  overexpression of CTHRC1 in turn suppresses Smad2/3 phosphorylation. WNT signaling
  includes the WNT/β-catenin classical pathway and the β-catenin atypical pathway.
  (Ba) In the WNT/β-catenin classical pathway, CTHRC1 can activate this pathway and
  significantly increase β-catenin stability and transcriptional activity. (Bb) In
  non-classical WNT/PCP signaling, CTHRC1 can promote and stabilize the formation
  of the CTHRC1-Wnt-FZD/Ror2 complex, thereby selectively activating the WNT/PCP pathway,
  whose downstream molecules include the GTPase family, such as Rac1, RhoA and JNK.
  CTHRC1 can enhance RhoA and Rac1 activities, and increase JNK phosphorylation, and
  DPAGT1 can regulate the activation of CTHRC1 on the Wnt/PCP pathway. (C) Upregulation
  of CTHRC1 activates Src-FAK signaling, which is associated with cancer progression
  and metastasis
