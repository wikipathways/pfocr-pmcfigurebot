caption: Pathway enrichment analysis for metabolites differed significantly between
  groups according to MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (p < 0.05). The number of hits inside a specific
  metabolic pathway divided by the anticipated number of hits yields the enrichment
  ratio. (A) The aqueous phase of L. fermentum U-21 culture supernatant. (B) The aqueous
  phase of L. fermentum 279â€²s culture supernatant
