caption: Mechanism of action of HMGB1. a—HMGB1; b—receptor for advanced glycation
  end product (RAGE); c—toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2); d—toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4);
  e—cell membrane; f, g, h—extracellular domains of RAGE; i—transmembrane-spanning
  domain; j—intracellular domain of RAGE; k, n—extracellular domains of TLR2/TLR4;
  l, o—single helix transmembrane domain; m, p—intracellular domains of TLR2/TLR4.
  This figure shows the 3 receptors for which HMGB1 is the ligand; these are RAGE
  (b), TLR2 (c) and TLR4 (d). RAGE is a type-I transmembrane protein that consists
  of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (f–h), a single trans-membrane
  helix (i) and a short intracellular C-terminal domain (j). HMGB1 binding to the
  extracellular domain activates pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory pathways; this
  is dependent on the molecules involved in the process. TLR2 (c) and TLR4 (d) are
  composed of 3 domains—they contain N-terminal extracellular domains (k, n), transmembrane
  domains that are single helixes (l, o) and intracellular C-terminal domains (m,
  p). The fusion of HMGB1 with TLR2 and TLR4 results in the activation of the full
  pro-inflammatory response, the NLRP3 inflammasome and the NF-κB pathway and the
  synthesis of inflammatory cytokines
