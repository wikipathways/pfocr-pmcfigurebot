caption: 'Characterization of epithelial cells in adenomyosis. (A) The overall landscape
  of adenomyosis was exhibited using spatial transcriptomic incorporating scRNA-seq
  data. Number of mRNA molecules per spot (color intensity) confidently assigned to
  SMCs, epithelial, stromal cells, Pv MYH11, and Pv STEAP4 in different uterine regions
  of adenomyosis. (B) The distribution of ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells
  in EnD, EnJ, and EnC in all 15 samples by UMAP. (C) The expression of differential
  gene expressions (DEGs) of epithelial cells in EnD, EnJ, and EnC. (D) Gene Ontology
  (GO) enrichment analysis of the top 100 DEGs in EnD, EnJ, and EnC. (E) Visualization
  of LGR5+ cells in adenomyosis samples by spatial transcriptomics. (F) mRNA expression
  levels of LGR5 in epithelial cells in Ctrl_EnD, AM_EnD, and AM_EnC examined by qRT-PCR
  (n = 5 per group). Data are presented as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.
  (G) Immunofluorescence (IF) staining for the expression of LGR5 and the epithelial
  marker E-CADHERIN in AM_EnC, AM_EnD, and Ctrl_EnD. Nuclei are stained with DAPI.
  Scale bar: 100 μm. (H) Statistical graph of the percentage of LGR5+ to E-CADHERIN+
  cells in H (n = 3 per group). Data are presented as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01;
  ns: no significance. (I) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for the expression
  of LGR5 in epithelial cells. Scale bar: 200 μm. (J) Protein expression of LGR5 was
  examined in epithelial cells in Ctrl_EnD, AM_EnD, and AM_EnC by semi-quantitative
  detection of immunohistochemistry (n = 10 per group). Data are presented as the
  mean ± SEM, **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001. (K) Schematic diagram of the LGR5/WNT signaling
  pathway. (L) The expression of DEGs for WNT signaling pathway of epithelial cells
  in EnD, EnJ, and EnC.'
