caption: The potential role of HDAC3 in atherosclerosis (AS). In endothelial cells
  (ECs), the interaction between HDAC3 and AKT is beneficial to the AKT-eNOS signaling
  pathway and nitric oxide (NO) production. Deletion of HDAC3 in ECs damages cell
  integrity and survival rates. ApoE-/- mice lacking HDAC3 in the aortas showed severe
  atherosclerotic lesions and ruptured blood vessels. Furthermore, the IκBα-HDAC3
  complex exists in the cytoplasm of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Salusin-β
  treatment induces repression of PPARγ expression due to the nuclear translocation
  of HDAC3, which may be attributed to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα.
  Moreover, the combination of HDAC3 and WD-40 repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5)
  forms a complexe, which positively modulates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  oxidase 1 (NOX1), thereby increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and promoting
  the transformation of VSMCs into a phenotype with increased cell migration and proliferation.
  Macrophages in mice lacking myeloid HDAC3 are converted to an anti-inflammatory
  phenotype and present an enhanced lipid efflux capacity. MiR-452-3p or miR-328-5p
  inhibits HDAC3 expression by directly targeting 3'UTR but increases the acetylation
  and expression levels of the ABCA1 gene, thereby reducing lipid accumulation in
  THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Collagen production by VSMCs is increased in
  myeloid HDAC3-deficient mice, thereby exhibiting a stable plaque phenotype in the
  atherosclerotic lesions.
