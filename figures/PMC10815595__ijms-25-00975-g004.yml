caption: Heatmap of diagnostic miRNA let-7a-5p, miR-320b/c. From left to right, the
  miRPATHv3 results indicate that let7a-5p is strongly associated with cell cycle,
  lysine degradation, viral carcinogenesis, the Hippo signaling pathway, Hepatitis
  B, the Adherens Junction Oocyte meiosis and ECMâ€“receptor interaction (see Table
  2/the Discussion section for further validation of direct HCC role). Let-7a-5p has
  also been associated with the modulation of TGF-B/SMAD signaling, Glioma, transcriptional
  irregularity in cancer, Fox-O signaling pathway, colorectal cancer, Proteoglycans
  in cancer, chronic myeloid Leukemia, HTLV-1-infection, small-cell lung cancer, MAPK
  signaling pathway, p53 signaling, the bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and
  other types of O-glycan synthesis. The full panel of let-7a-5p, miR-320b/c is only
  significantly associated with Hippo signaling
