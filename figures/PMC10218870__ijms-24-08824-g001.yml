caption: Schematic diagram showing the main molecular targets of luteolin during the
  initial steps of the metastatic cascade. The flavone interferes with the epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) by inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and several
  molecular regulators of mesenchymal cell phenotype (e.g., miRNs, HIF-1/VEGF axis,
  etc.), whereas it enhances the epithelial features. Luteolin exerts anti-angiogenic
  effects, mainly by blocking the VEGF/VEGFRs signaling pathway and by inhibiting
  MMPs. Moreover, this compound hampers cell invasiveness by slowing down the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) degradation through the blockade of MMPs activation and a set of related
  intracellular pathways. Luteolin induces apoptosis (both the intrinsic and extrinsic
  routes) by acting on the expression and activities of correlated effectors
