caption: The recognition of microbial components (molecular patterns associated with
  pathogens—PAMPs) by defense cells induces an increase in inflammatory cytokines
  in periodontal tissues. These cytokines stimulate the activation of the JAK-STAT
  pathway, which results in the transduction of more inflammatory cytokines, amplifying
  the inflammatory response and tissue destruction. JAK inhibitors bind to and competitively
  inhibit the kinase domain of JAKs, thereby preventing JAKs from phosphorylating
  STATs and other substrates so that intracellular signals cannot be further transduced.
  Because JAKs are critical for multiple different cytokines, JAK inhibitors can block
  the action of a range of cytokines and contribute to the reduction of the inflammatory
  response and tissue destruction in the periodontium
