caption: 'Related inhibitors on the modulation of the IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT pathway induced
  by β-cyc in PC12 cells. (A) The phosphorylation of the IGF-1R, PI3K, and AKT induced
  by β-cyc or its combination with low-dose NGF were downregulated by T9576. (B) The
  phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT stimulated by β-cyc or its combination with low-dose
  NGF was reduced by LY294002. Each experiment was repeated three times. The data
  were expressed as a mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001, compared
  with the negative control; ### p < 0.001, compared with the 3 µM β-cyc group; $ p
  < 0.05 and $$$ p < 0.001, compared with the combination group of β-cyc with low-dose
  NGF'
