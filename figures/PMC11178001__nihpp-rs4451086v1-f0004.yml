caption: Cell populations (cluster 2, resting chondrocytes) that are underrepresented
  in the mutant growth plates. A) Violin plots showing the expression of top genes
  in cluster 2, Grem1, Barx1, Ucma, and Bgn. B) Immunofluorescence for Ucma protein
  – it’s expression was detected in articular chondrocytes and resting chondrocytes
  in the control growth plate while in the mutant, Ucma expression is almost absent
  in these regions; C) GSEA of cluster 2 showing upregulated (shown in red) and downregulated
  (shown in blue) pathways; D) GSEA plot showing that molecular function of structural
  constituent of ribosome pathway is upregulated in this cluster 2

  chondrocytes reveal distinct cell populations responsible for longitudinal growth
  and enchondroma formation
