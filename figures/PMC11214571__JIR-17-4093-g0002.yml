caption: T-cell subsets and hallmark signaling pathways associated with P53 pathway.
  (a) The proportion of 7 T-cell subsets in each sample using CIBERSORT. Color indicates
  the T cell types. The horizontal axis indicates patient samples. (b) Correlation
  of T-cell subsets percentages. Color indicates the correlation direction. Each cell
  contains Pearson correlation coefficient. (c and d) The relationship between P53
  pathway and T cell subgroups. (c) CIBERSORT algorithm, (d) ssGSVA algorithm. N represents
  the total number of patients in integrated dataset. The horizontal axis indicates
  P53 pathway. The longitudinal axis represents T cell subsets. (eâ€“i) The correlation
  between P53 pathway and hallmark signaling pathways as well as TCR signaling. N
  represents the total number of patients in integrated dataset. The horizontal axis
  indicates P53 pathway. The longitudinal axis represents signaling pathways.
