caption: 'Immune response during HBV infection. (A) Cytokine-mediated hepatocyte death:
  (1) In this process, HBV cccDNA generates multiple RNA lineages. (2) These RNAs
  are transported to the cytoplasm to synthesize viral antigens, including core (HBsAg),
  surface (HBsAg), and e antigens (HBeAg). (3) Proteasomes cleave these antigens,
  creating peptides recognized by pattern recognition receptors. (5–7) Activation
  of these receptors triggers interferon transcription and translation pathways. (8–10)
  Secreted interferons activate resident phagocytes and natural killer cells (NK cells).
  (4) CD8 lymphocytes (CD8 T cells) can be activated by the major histocompatibility
  complex class I (MHC-I), specifically human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2) subtype,
  presenting the peptides produced by the proteasome. (11) Immune cells produce cytokines
  that initiate apoptosis through cytoplasmic and nuclear pathways. (12) The nuclear
  pathway starts with perforin release, forming channels in the cell membrane for
  granzymes to enter the cytoplasm. Granzymes affect mitochondria, generating reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). (13) Elevated ROS levels trigger the release of the SET complex
  from the endoplasmic reticulum. (14) The SET complex contains endonuclease domains,
  facilitating DNA cleavage in the nucleus to aid apoptosis. (15) The cytoplasmic
  pathway is mainly initiated by the interaction between the soluble Fas ligand (SFasL)
  and Fas surface receptor (Fas) in the serum. This interaction involves recruiting
  adapter proteins like Fas-associated death domain (FADD). FADD then activates caspase-8,
  which activates downstream effector caspases, including caspase-3. (16) Caspases
  target specific proteins, called apoptotic substrates, which lead to cellular dismantling.
  (B) Viral particle neutralization in the bloodstream: (1) Viruses released from
  infected hepatocytes are captured and processed by bloodstream phagocytes. (2) Processed
  peptides are presented by MHC-class II to CD4 T cells, resulting in IL-21 release.
  (3–5) IL-21 induces B cell differentiation into plasma cells, producing primary
  antibodies against HBV infection. Abbreviations: IgM anti-HBc: immunoglobulin M
  antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen. IgG anti-HBc: immunoglobulin G antibodies
  against hepatitis B core antigen. IgG anti-HBs: immunoglobulin G antibodies against
  hepatitis B surface antigen. IgG anti-HBe: immunoglobulin G antibodies against hepatitis
  B e antigen.'
