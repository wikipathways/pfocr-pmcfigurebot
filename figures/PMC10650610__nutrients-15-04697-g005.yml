caption: Regulation of CD8+ T cell glucose metabolism and immunity by 1,25(OH)₂D₃
  via AMPK signaling pathway. (a). The uptake of 2-NBDG by TALL-104 cells in each
  group was observed using fluorescence assay. (b). Fluorescence intensity of 2-NBDG
  uptake by TALL-104 cells in each group. (c). LDH activity of TALL-104 cells in each
  group. (d). HK activity of TALL-104 cells in each group. (e). Levels of IFN-γ in
  the supernatant of TALL-104 cells in each group. (f). GLUT1, LDHA, HKII and IFNG
  mRNA expression in each group. (g). The expression and phosphorylation of AMPK in
  each group. (h). The expression and phosphorylation of AMPK were analyzed using
  Western blotting after treatment of TALL-104 cells with 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and/or Compound
  C. (i). 2-NBDG fluorescence intensity, LDH activity, HK activity and IFN-γ level
  in supernatant of TALL-104 cells treated with 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and/or Compound C. Data
  are from a representative one of three experiments and are expressed as mean ± standard
  deviation (SD). Individual data points are represented as black dots. *, p < 0.05;
