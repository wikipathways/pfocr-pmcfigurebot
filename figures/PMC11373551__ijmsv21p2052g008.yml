caption: Identification of core regulatory genes and construction of partial correlation
  interaction networks related to taurine metabolism pathways. 8A shows the partial
  correlation interaction network related to taurine metabolism pathways associated
  with core gene expression in the vascular adventitia. 8B analyzes the interactions
  between the core regulatory gene PTGS2 and its upstream and downstream genes in
  the vascular adventitia. 8C displays the partial correlation interaction network
  related to taurine metabolism pathways associated with core gene expression in the
  vascular media. 8D analyzes the interactions between the core regulatory gene MS4A1
  and its upstream and downstream genes in the vascular adventitia
