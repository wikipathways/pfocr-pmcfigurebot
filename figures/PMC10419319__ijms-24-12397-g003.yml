figure_title: Isoalantolactone sensitizes A2780cisR and SNU-8cisR OC cells to cisplatin
  via an apoptotic pathway.
caption: 'Isoalantolactone sensitizes A2780cisR and SNU-8cisR OC cells to cisplatin
  via an apoptotic pathway. Cells were treated with 10 µM isoalantolactone combined
  with cisplatin 2 µg/mL (A2780cisR) and 5 µg/mL (SNU-8cisR) for 48 h: (A) Flow cytometric
  analysis of apoptosis in A2780cisR and SNU-8cisR OC cells. (B) The combined effect
  of isoalantolactone–cisplatin on the expression of apoptotic proteins. Cell lysates
  from A2780cisR and SNU-8cisR OC cells were confirmed using Western blotting. (C)
  The combined effect of isoalantolactone–cisplatin on caspase-3/7 activities. The
  caspase 3/7 activity was evaluated using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay Kit. The results
  are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). *** p < 0.001'
