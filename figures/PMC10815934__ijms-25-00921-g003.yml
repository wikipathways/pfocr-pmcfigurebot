figure_title: VCO induces tumor hypoxia.
caption: VCO induces tumor hypoxia. Different mechanisms in VCO induce tumor hypoxia.
  During VCO, cancer cells hijack pre-existing blood vessels and compress them. This
  generates a decrease of blood flow that leads to hypoxia. At the same time, cancer
  cell proliferation increases oxygen demand, that the reduced blood flow cannot supply.
  This lead to a decrease of the oxygen levels in the TME. On the other hand, during
  VCO, the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway is downregulated, and this downregulation
  lead to an increase of MET signaling. MET activation activates hypoxia inducible
  factors, such as HIF1α
