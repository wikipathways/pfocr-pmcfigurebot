caption: LV-ETV4 activates the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, whereas LV-ETV4-RNAi
  inhibits the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. (A) Reverse transcription-quantitative
  PCR results showed that in the LV-ETV4 group, the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β1
  and Smad4 were increased, whereas the mRNA expression levels of Smad7 were decreased.
  In the LV-ETV4-RNAi group, the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β1 and Smad4 were decreased,
  whereas those of Smad7 were increased. (B) Western blotting showed similar results.
