figure_title: A549 cells have quantifiably different metabolic responses to SARS-CoV-2
caption: (A) Significant metabolites (FC >1.5) from ACE2-A549 and A549 cells were
  compared to identify similar and different metabolites that change in response to
  SARS-CoV-2. (B) Pathway analysis on significant metabolites from ACE2-A549 and A549
  cells. (C) Evaluating metabolic pathway changes relative to energy generation. Amino
  acids that were downregulated in Ace2-A549 are shown within the pathway highlighted
  in purple. Fatty acid metabolism was upregulated in A549 cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2,
  highlighted separately in blue. Both pathways directly or indirectly connect with
  components of the TCA cycle and glycolysis
