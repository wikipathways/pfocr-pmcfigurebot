caption: (A and B) Forest plots showing association between PC1 and PC2 scores from
  a maternal postpartum week 1 PCA model based on 46 metabolites that had a VIP score
  >2 in relation to calibrated vitamin D level and primary child clinical end points.
  Forest plot in (A) shows when not stratified by child 17q21 rs12936231 genotypes,
  while plot in (B) shows when stratified by child 17q21 rs12936231 genotypes. Regression
  models were used between PCA scores and clinical end points. The x-axis represents
  relative risk for each component score, while the y-axis represents each clinical
  end point. Each dot represents relative risk per unit of component score, while
  the error bar represents 95% CI of relative risk. Different colors represent rs12936231
  genotypes. Cox regression models were used to test the association between the metabolites
  and persistent wheeze, asthma, and exacerbation end points. Linear regression models
  were used between the metabolites and lung function end points. Logistic regression
  models were used for allergic sensitization, while quasi-Poisson regression models
  were used for TROLS. PC1 and PC2 explained 21.5% and 12.5% of the variance, respectively.
  (C) Circos plot showing association between 12 sphingomyelins from maternal postpartum
  week 1 and child clinical end points. Twelve sphingomyelins were selected because
  the sphingomyelin pathway was the metabolic pathway most affected by vitamin D level,
  ie, significant enrichment, and 12 of them had VIP scores >2. Orange line represents
  negative association at nominal level (P < .05). corr., Corrected; Epi.No., number
  of episodes; Neg., negative; Pos., positive; sRAW, specific airway resistance
