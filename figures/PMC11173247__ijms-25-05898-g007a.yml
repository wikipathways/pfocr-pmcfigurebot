figure_title: Foliar glucosinolate (GSL) levels and expression of GSL biosynthesis
  genes.
caption: 'Foliar glucosinolate (GSL) levels and expression of GSL biosynthesis genes.
  Four-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype (WT) or lox2 plants were wounded with
  a hole punch on each fully expanded rosette leaf and harvested at 1 and 12 h. (A)
  Foliar aliphatic and indolic GSL levels in undamaged (U) and wounded (W) WT and
  lox2 plants taken 12 h after mechanical damage. (B) GSL pathway illustrating transcriptional
  activators, biosynthetic enzymes and other GSL-related proteins. Gene expression
  in (C) undamaged and (D) mechanically damaged arabidopsis rosettes. Glucosinolate
  levels are represented by the mean ± SE. Differences in GSL levels were determined
  by a two-factor analysis of variance (2-factor ANOVA) (factors: genotype (WT or
  lox2), treatment) followed by Tukey HSD (Supplemental Table S3). Heatmaps visualize
  gene expression (for C: wildtype—1 h (WT-1), wildtype—12 h (WT-12), lox2—1 h (lox2-1),
  lox2—12 h (lox2-12); for D: wildtype undamaged—WT-U, wildtype wounded—WT-W, lox2
  undamaged—lox2-U, lox2 wounded—lox2-W)). Genes: BCAT4 (At3g19710), MAM1 (At5g23010),
