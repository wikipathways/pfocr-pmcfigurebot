figure_title: Effect of TFPS on the MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathway.
caption: Effect of TFPS on the MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathway. RAW 264.7 cells
  (5 × 105 cells/mL) were treated with the indicated concentration of TFPS or LPS
  for 1 h. (A,B) The expression levels of p-ERK/ERK, p-p38/p38 and p-JNK/JNK were
  determined by Western blot. (C) Immunofluorescence was used to determine the expression
  levels of NF-κB (p65) in the cytosolic fraction and nuclear fraction. (D,E) The
  expression levels of NF-κB (p65) in the cytosolic fraction and nuclear fraction
  were determined by Western blot. Data are presented as the means ± SEM (n = 3).
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, compared with the untreated group
