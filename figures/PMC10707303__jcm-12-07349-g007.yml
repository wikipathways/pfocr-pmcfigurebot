figure_title: OPN-mediated fibrosis in DKD.
caption: 'OPN-mediated fibrosis in DKD. The diagram illustrates OPN-mediated signaling
  pathways. The detrimental impacts of OPN occur via its interaction with receptors,
  integrins, and CD44. Binding to these receptors leads to significant proinflammatory
  functions, enabling OPN to trigger the activation of various pathways, including
  cell survival, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and fibrosis. Abbreviations:
  OPN: osteopontin, ntOPN: N-terminal osteopontin, TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β,
  ERK/MAPK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase,
  JNK/MAPK: jun N-terminal kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K/AKT/mTOR:
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Ak strain transforming/mammalian target of rapamycin,
  FAK/ERK1/2/NF-κB: focal adhesion kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1
  and 2/nuclear factor kappa B'
