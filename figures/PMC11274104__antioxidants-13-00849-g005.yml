caption: GO enrichment analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis on the differently expressed
  genes (DEGs) in the muscles of C. carpio between the LD and HD groups. (A) The top
  5 altered GO terms (Level 2) in the biological process category following HD treatment
  compared with LD treatment. (B) The top 5 altered GO terms (Level 2) in the molecular
  function category following HD treatment compared with LD treatment. (C) The top
  5 altered GO terms (Level 2) in the cellular component category following HD treatment
  compared with LD treatment. (D) The top 10 enriched KEGG pathways following HD treatment
  compared with LD treatment
