figure_title: Effects of additional light on the expression of several hormone signaling
  genes, namely, auxin response factor 16 (ARF16), auxin response factor 3/4 (ARF3/4),
  auxin-induced protein 1 (AUX/IAA), jasmonate–Zim domain 1 (JAZa), histidine-containing
  phosphotransfer 1 (HPT1), Steroid 5-α-reductase (BR–α–RED) and brassinosteroid-mediated
  signaling pathway gene (BRZ2), and on genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis,
  namely, monoterpene synthases such as TPS–mono1 (mono-TERP), α-terpineol synthase
  TPS–α-terp (α-TERP) and chalcone synthase (CHS) in current-year needles (A); cambium
  of previous-year shoots (B); and current-year roots (C).
caption: 'Effects of additional light on the expression of several hormone signaling
  genes, namely, auxin response factor 16 (ARF16), auxin response factor 3/4 (ARF3/4),
  auxin-induced protein 1 (AUX/IAA), jasmonate–Zim domain 1 (JAZa), histidine-containing
  phosphotransfer 1 (HPT1), Steroid 5-α-reductase (BR–α–RED) and brassinosteroid-mediated

  namely, monoterpene synthases such as TPS–mono1 (mono-TERP), α-terpineol synthase
  TPS–α-terp (α-TERP) and chalcone synthase (CHS) in current-year needles (A); cambium
  of previous-year shoots (B); and current-year roots (C). The color scale indicates
  how many times the expression changes: dark red represents a change of more than
  2 times, and dark blue represents a change of more than 2 times relative to the
  control of sunlight without additional light. The transcript levels were normalized
  to the expression of the Actin1 gene in the aboveground organs and to the expression
  of the GAPDH gene in the roots. Gene expression under sunlight without additional
  light was used as one unit. Different letters within each row indicate significant
  differences (p < 0.05) according to ANOVA on ranks followed by Duncan’s multiple
  range post hoc test (regular letters) or Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks followed
  by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test (italic letters)'
