figure_title: Key secretory proteins enhanced Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathway.
caption: Key secretory proteins enhanced Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathway. (A) PPI
  (protein-protein interaction) network of secretory proteins enhanced Hedgehog and
  Wnt signaling pathway. The 8 hits in the middle of the network were key secretory
  proteins involved in the activation of signaling pathways. Secretory proteins that
  could directly interact with these 8 key proteins were presented in the outer cycle.
  Red represents up-regulation of the genes, and conversely blue represents down-regulation.
  Color gray represents the up/down-regulation levels of genes. (B) ELISA-based quantification
  of TGF-β1 levels in supernatant of control, ETP and F30-HSCs. (C) ELISA-based quantification
  of CTGF levels. (D) ELISA-based quantification of PDGF-BB levels. (E) ELISA-based
  quantification of IGF1 levels. (F) ELISA-based quantification of Wnt-10b levels.
  (G) ELISA-based quantification of SHh-N levels. All data were expressed as mean
  ± SEM. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 compared to control (growing HSCs with no treatment)
