  signaling pathway in vivo.
caption: 'ASIV promotes ALDH2 expression, inhibits autophagy, and activates AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway in vivo. (a) ALDH2 mRNA level in the renal tissues using qRT-PCR
  for each group. (b) Protein expression of ALDH2 in the renal tissues of each group
  using Western blotting. (c) Quantitative analysis of the relative protein expression
  of ALDH2 in the renal tissues. (d) Representative images of immunohistochemistry
  staining for ALDH2 in the rat kidneys (n = 6, 100 µm scale bar). (e) Relative gene
  expressions of Mtor, Map1lc3b, Becn1, and Atg7 in the renal tissues of each group
  (n = 6). (f) Protein expressions of p-AKT, t-AKT, p-mTOR, t-mTOR, ATG7, SQSTM1,
  Beclin1, and LC3 I/II in the renal tissues of each group using Western blotting.
  (g) Quantitative analysis of the phosphorylation levels of AKT and mTOR in the renal
  tissues. (h) Quantitative analysis of the relative protein expressions of ATG7,
  SQSTM1, Beclin1, and LC3 II/LC3 I in the renal tissues. (i) Representative images
  of immunofluorescence staining for LC3 I/II/α-tubulin in the rat kidneys (n = 6,
  100 µm scale bar). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA was followed
  by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. ### p < 0.001 vs. the control group, * p
  < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 vs. the adenine group'
