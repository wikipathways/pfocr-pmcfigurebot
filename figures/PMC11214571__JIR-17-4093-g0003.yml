caption: T-cell subsets and hallmark signaling pathways associated with genes in P53
  pathway. (a) Box and violin plot for expression levels of four genes in P53 pathway.
  Data follows non-normal distribution. Wilcoxon test was used to identify significant
  differences. *P< 0.05, **P< 0.01; ns, not significant. (b and c) The correlation
  between genes in P53 pathway and T cell subsets (ssGSVA algorithm). N represents
  the total number of patients in integrated dataset. The horizontal axis indicates
  genes in P53 pathway. The longitudinal axis represents T cell subsets. (dâ€“j) The
  correlation between genes in P53 pathway and hallmark signaling pathways as well
  as TCR signaling. N represents the total number of patients in integrated dataset.
  The horizontal axis indicates genes in P53 pathway. The longitudinal axis represents
  signaling pathways.
