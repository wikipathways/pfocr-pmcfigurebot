figure_title: Interplay between obesity, sex hormone metabolism, inflammation, and
  melanoma progression.
caption: 'Interplay between obesity, sex hormone metabolism, inflammation, and melanoma
  progression. The enzyme aromatase converts androgens into estrogens, consequently
  activating the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) signaling pathway. Activation
  of this pathway has been shown to suppress melanoma cell proliferation and enhance
  the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Abbreviations: CYP19, cytochrome
  P450 family 19; GPER, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor; LR, leptin receptor;
  FATPs, fatty acid transporter proteins; FA, fatty acid; CyR, cytokine receptor;
  JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; cAMP,
  cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophophate; MyC, MyC proto-oncogene; MAP2K, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase; IL-1, interleukin 1; IL-6, interleukin-6; IL-18, interleukin-18;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha. Arrows: ⬆, increase; ➡, stimulates; dashed line,
  influences; ⊣, inhibits. Adapted from Roccuzzo et al. [21]. Created with Biorender'
