figure_title: VDR agonist inactivates JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and suppresses endoplasmic
  reticulum stress during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
caption: 'VDR agonist inactivates JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and suppresses endoplasmic
  reticulum stress during bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Mice were randomly
  divided into four groups: Control, Paricalcitol, BLM, and BLM + Paricalcitol. (A)
  Protein levels of phosphorylated JAK1, JAK1, phosphorylated STAT3, and STAT3 in
  lung tissues were determined in the Control, Paricalcitol, BLM, and BLM + Paricalcitol
  groups. Representative protein bands were presented on the left of the histograms.
  (B), Protein levels of Grp78 and CHOP in lung tissues were determined in the Control,
  Paricalcitol, BLM, and BLM + Paricalcitol groups. Representative protein bands were
  presented on the left of the histograms. (C) Lung sections were stained with fluorophore-labeled
  antibodies against the cell proliferation marker Ki67 (Alexa Fluor 647, red) and
  the fibroblast marker FSP-1 (Alexa Fluor 488, green). DAPI staining was used to
  detect nuclei (blue). The merge image represents double positive staining for FSP-1
  and Ki67. Areas in white boxes were shown enlarged. Scale bars correspond to 50
  μm. Quantification of the percentage of ki67+/FSP-1+ cells in total FSP-1+ cells
  in lung tissue sections is presented on the right of the representative images.
  Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 7). ** p < 0.01 vs. Control. && p < 0.01
  vs. BLM. BLM represents bleomycin'
