caption: Osmosensors mediate drought stress signaling. MID1-COMPLEMENTING ACTIVITY
  (MCAs), REDUCED HYPEROSMOLALITY-INDUCED CA2+ INCREASE1 (OSCA1), and CALCIUM PERMEABLE
  STRESS-GATED CATION CHANNEL 1 (CSC1) are Ca2+ channels that become activated in
  response to drought stress, leading to an increase in cytosolic calcium ions (Ca2+).
  Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) sense the elevated Ca2+ levels in the cytosol
  and initiate downstream signaling cascades. Under drought stress, DROOPY LEAF1 (DPY1)
  is phosphorylated, resulting in the global phosphorylation of various proteins,
  including STRESS ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE6 (SAPK6), mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (MAPKs), calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), and Raf-like kinases (RAFs).
  Histidine kinases (HKs) located on the plasma membrane also participate in the MAPK
  signaling pathway
