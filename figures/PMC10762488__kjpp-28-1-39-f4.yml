figure_title: Effects of wogonin on the phosphorylation of MAPKs
caption: VSMCs were treated with Ang II (100 nM) in the presence or absence of wogonin
  (10 μM) or NS for 24 h. (A) The levels of the key proteins in the MAPK signaling
  pathway in Control, Ang II, Ang II + NS, and Ang II + Wogonin groups were examined
  using Western blot analysis. (B–D) The ratio of p-ERK/ERK, p-JNK/JNK, and p-p38/p38
  was calculated. N = 3. (E) The protein levels of CDK4, Cyclin D1, MMP2, and MMP9
  in the Control, Ang II, Ang II + NS, and Ang II + Wogonin groups were examined using
  Western blot analysis. (F–I) The protein levels of CDK4, Cyclin D1, MMP2, and MMP9
  were quantified. N = 3. Measurement data are expressed as the mean ± SD. MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells; Ang II, angiotensin II; NS,
  normal saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; CDK4, cyclin-dependent kinase4; MMP2, matrix metalloproteinase2; MMP9, matrix
  metalloproteinase9. **p < 0.01
