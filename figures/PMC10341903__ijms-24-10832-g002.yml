caption: Gene clusters and their expressions of gibberellin in FsCNO-1 cultured in
  different nitrogen availability. (A) Gibberellin and flanking gene cluster in FsCNO-1.
  Arrows show the orientation of transcription. Gibberellin genes are shown in blue
  and other colors are shown flanking the GA cluster. (B) Heatmap analysis of expression
  data derived from RNA-Seq for the gibberellin gene cluster after culturing in different
  nitrogen treatments. (C) Relative expression of gibberellin core genes validated
  by qRT-PCR. (D) Gibberellin biosynthetic pathway in the F. sacchari
