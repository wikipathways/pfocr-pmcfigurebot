caption: 'Living B. breve A1 in the gut lumen leads to a decrease in seizure susceptibility
  via an ILK-dependent signaling pathway, the mechanism of which is caused by a still-unknown
  signal via the gut–brain axis. ILK is a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase that
  mediates signal transduction derived from integrin and growth factors [38]. ILK
  interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of β1-integrin and functions as a scaffold
  protein bridging integrin and the actin cytoskeleton and various intracellular signaling
  pathways that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and migration [39]. In integrin-mediated
  cell survival signaling, ILK, one of the kinases in the cell survival pathway [29,30],
  and its downstream molecule Akt exert neuroprotective effects against hippocampal
  cell death after epileptic seizure [21,37]. The figure shows representative ILK-dependent
  cell growth and survival signaling pathways [42]. In the present study, B. breve
  A1-induced Akt activation occurred after PTZ injection, and the ILK inhibitor Cpd22
  completely blocked its activation. At the same time, Cpd22 nullified the inhibitory
  effect of B. breve A1 on PTZ-induced seizures. Moreover, B. breve A1 recovered the
  decreased protein expression level of neuropsin, which is one of the plasticity-related
  extracellular proteases [26]. Therefore, we propose that B. breve A1-induced ILK
  activation promotes the phosphorylation of the key target signal proteins, including
  Akt, essential for integrin-dependent cell survival and proliferation, and exerts
  neuroprotective action against hippocampal cell death and abnormal changes in synaptic
  plasticity after epileptic seizures, resulting in decreased seizure susceptibility
  following the chronic administration of PTZ. Abbreviations: mTORC, mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex; Casp3, caspase-3; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; GSK-3β, glycogen
  synthase kinase-3β'
