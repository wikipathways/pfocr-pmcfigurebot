caption: The enrichment analysis of DEGs in meat quality regulation-related pathways
  and correlation analysis between DEGs and differential metabolites (Spearman correlation).
  (a,b) Downregulation and upregulation of DEGs in KEGG enrichment pathway map; different
  colors represent different classified pathway sets, and bubble size indicates the
  number of DEGs. (c–e) Correlation analysis of DEGs and differential metabolites.
  (c,d) Spearman correlation analysis of DEGs with phospholipid metabolite and fatty
  acyl differential metabolite. (e) Spearman correlation analysis of DEGs and differential
  metabolite such as vitamin coenzyme and carbohydrate related to sugar metabolism
  and vitamin metabolism, color depth represents correlation strength, positive and
  negative correlation are denoted by red and blue colors, correspondingly; asterisks
  denote the significant variation * α = 0.05, ** α = 0.01
