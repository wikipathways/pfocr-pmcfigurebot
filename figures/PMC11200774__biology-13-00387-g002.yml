caption: 'Potential exosomal diagnostic biomarkers in mind and volition disorders.
  Abnormal expression of miRNAs associated with apoptosis, oxidative stress, and insulin
  pathways was detected in patients with SCZ. Note: Light green boxes represent exosomal
  biomarkers; red font represents increased expression; green font represents decreased
  expression. miR: microRNA/miRNA; bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma 2; bcl-w: B-cell lymphoma
  w; DJ-1/PARK7: human protein deglycase, encoding by the PARK7 gene; ROS: reactive
  oxygen species; (pS2448-mTOR)/m-TOR: the ratio of the ratio of phosphorylated mammalian
  target of rapamycin (pS2448-mTOR) to total mammalian target of rapamycin to total
  mammalian target of rapamycin'
