caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in neuroprotective mechanisms. Metformin’s potential
  as a neuroprotective agent. Metformin is known to traverse the BBB through the actions
  of the PMAT and OCT3 transporters. Metformin modulates inflammatory status and inhibits
  oxidative damage markers like TBARS, MDA, carbonyl groups, and FOXO3, while concurrently
  stimulating AMPK. Furthermore, the activation of AMPK by metformin determines the
  inhibition of mTOR, resulting in increased autophagy, neurogenesis, enhanced mitochondrial
  function, and decreased DNA damage. This AMPK activation also plays a crucial role
  in reducing protein phosphorylation by inhibiting PPA2. Notably, metformin’s neuroprotective
  influence extends beyond neurons, encompassing astrocytes and microglia, effectively
  curtailing oxidative damage and inflammation in the neural web. Legend: BBB: blood–brain
  barrier; PMAT: plasma membrane monoamine transporter; OCT3: organic cation transporter
