caption: Altered molecular pathways associated with immune function in PIEs infected
  with G9P[13] and G5P[7]. For canonical immune signaling pathway analysis, the −log
  (p-value) > 1.3 was used as the threshold and the Z-score > 2 was defined as the
  threshold of significant activation, while a Z-score < −2 was defined as the threshold
  for significant inhibition. Bars indicate the activation z-score; blue symbols represent
  p values in log10 format
