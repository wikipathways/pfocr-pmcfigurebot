caption: Predicted Role of ANKHD1 in the JAK/STAT Signalling Pathway. An overview
  of the critical components of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway in mammals. ANKHD1
  is predicted to regulate the levels of cytokine receptors to allow for an increase
  in receptor levels and an increase in downstream JAK autophosphorylation. JAK autophosphorylation
  triggers the phosphorylation of the intracellular portion of the cytokine receptor
  and the phosphorylation of STAT dimers. This increase in phosphorylated STATs dimerisation
  results in increased translocation of the complex to the nucleus, where they interact
  with various promoter regions and causes an increase in gene transcription
