figure_title: Knockout of macrophage Atg16l1 expression induces type I interferon
  signaling and inflammatory responses.
caption: Knockout of macrophage Atg16l1 expression induces type I interferon signaling
  and inflammatory responses. (A) Schematic diagram showing that primary hepatocytes
  isolated from Atg16l1fl/fl mice with or without PAOA stimulation were cocultured
  with LPS-primed primary BMDMs from Atg16l1fl/fl and Atg16l1ΔMϕ mice. (B) Volcano
  plot of all DEGs in cocultured Atg16l1fl/fl and Atg16l1ΔMϕ BMDMs. (C) Heatmap showing
  the clustering of 19 upregulated genes affecting the IFN-I response. (D) STRING-based
  network analysis of genes detected in (C), revealing a strong contribution of an
  IFN-I-related signature. (E) The expression of genes detected in (C). (F) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis of the pathways associated with genes whose expression was upregulated
  in stimulated Atg16l1ΔMϕ BMDMs compared with that in Atg16l1fl/fl BMDMs. (G) The
  proinflammatory protein expression levels in stimulated Atg16l1fl/fl and Atg16l1ΔMϕ
  BMDMs. (H) Heatmap showing the clustering of 65 upregulated genes that affect the
  phagosome signaling pathway. (I) The gene expression levels of Marco, Msr1, and
  Cd14. (J) Heatmap showing that Tfeb expression was markedly lower in stimulated
  Atg16l1ΔMϕ BMDMs than in Atg16l1fl/fl BMDMs. (K) The gene expression level of Tfeb
  in stimulated Atg16l1fl/fl and Atg16l1ΔMϕ BMDMs. (L) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of the pathways associated with genes whose expression was downregulated in stimulated
  Atg16l1ΔMϕ BMDMs compared with that in Atg16l1fl/fl BMDMs. (M) Heatmap showing the
  clustering of 46 downregulated genes that affect the lysosome signaling pathway.
  (N) The gene expression levels of Hexa, Ctsb, and Gla. ATG16L1, autophagyrelated
  protein 16-like 1; PAOA, palmitic acid- and oleic acid; BMDMs, bone marrow-derived
  macrophages; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; STING, stimulator of
  interferon genes. The data are expressed as the mean±SD. *P<0.05 (unpaired t test
  or ANOVA)
