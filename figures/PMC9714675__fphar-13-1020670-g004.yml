caption: The up-regulation of gene expression of cGAS-STING pathways in IBD patients,
  including UC and CD. (A) The relative expression changes of macrophage cGAS-STING
  signaling pathway in IBD patients. (B) The mRNA levels of cGAS-STING signaling pathway
  in UC and CD responder/non-responder patients, before and after treatment of anti-TNF
  (infliximab), compared with non-IBD controls. R., anti-TNF responders; nR., anti-TNF
  non-responders; Bef αTNF, before anti-TNF treatment; Aft αTNF, after anti-TNF treatment.
  All data are shown as mean ± SD and are analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by
  Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. UC, ulcerative colitis; CD, Crohn’s disease.
