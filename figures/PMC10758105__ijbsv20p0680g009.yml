  and aortic tissues with Ang II exposure via αV/β5 receptor-AMPK/p38 pathway.
caption: Irisin inhibited calcium overload, ER stress and remodeling in VSMCs and
  aortic tissues with Ang II exposure via αV/β5 receptor-AMPK/p38 pathway. A and B.
  The effect of irisin supplementation on the expression levels of ERS-related proteins
  and kinases (AMPK and p38) in Ang II-treated VSMCs was evaluated by immunoblotting.
  VSMCs were treated with irisin (20 nM) or Ang II (1 μM) alone, or irisin (20 nM)
  in combination with Ang II (1 μM) in the absence and presence of αV/β5 antibody
  (n=3/group). C. Intracellular calcium levels in VSMCs treated with irisin (20 nM)
  or Ang II (1 μM) alone, or irisin (20 nM) in combination with Ang II (1 μM) in the
  absence and presence of αV/β5 antibody (n=3/group). D-E. The levels of phosphorylated-
  and total-AMPK and p38 in lysates of aortic tissues from WT, irisin-KO, and irisin-OV
  mice infused with saline or Ang II (490 ng/min/kg) for 4 weeks were detected using
  immunoblotting (n=3/group). F. Edu incorporation assay evaluated the proliferation
  ability of VSMCs treated with irisin (20 nM) or Ang II (1 μM) alone, or irisin (20
  nM) in combination with Ang II (1 μM) in the absence and presence of αV/β5 antibody,
  or compound C (an AMPK inhibitor, 5 μM), or HY-W007355 (a p38 activator, 10 μM)
  for 24 h (n=4/group). G. Transwell migration assay evaluated the migration of VSMCs
  treated with irisin (20 nM) or Ang II (1 μM) alone, or irisin (20 nM) in combination
  with Ang II (1 μM) in the absence and presence of αV/β5 antibody, or compound C
  (an AMPK inhibitor, 5 μM), or HY-W007355 (a p38 activator, 10 μM) for 24 h (n=4/group).
  H. Phenotypic switching indicated by the mRNA expressions of VSMC-specific contractile
  genes (including SMA, SM22, calponin, and caldesmon1) in VSMCs treated with irisin
  (20 nM) or Ang II (1 μM) alone, or irisin (20 nM) in combination with Ang II (1
  μM) in the absence and presence of αV/β5 antibody, or compound C (an AMPK inhibitor,
  5 μM), or HY-W007355 (a p38 activator, 10 μM) for 24 h (n=4/group). The data were
  presented as mean ± S.E.M., and the statistical analyses were performed by one way
  ANOVA. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. Ctrl, control; I, irisin; Ang II, angiotensin II;
  SMA, SM α-actin; SM22, smooth muscle 22 alpha; WT, wild type mice; KO, irisin knockout
  mice; OV, irisin overexpression mice
