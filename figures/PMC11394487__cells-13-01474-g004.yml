figure_title: Sirtuin signaling pathway.
caption: 'Sirtuin signaling pathway. Description: NAD+ activates SIRT1–SIRT7. SIRT1
  converts NAD+ to NAM. SIRT1 activates ATG, Clock-Bmal1, DOT1L, EPAS1, FOXO1, FOXO3,
  FOXO4, HSF1, Histone H1, Histone H3, Histone H4, NAMPT, NBN, NDRG1, NFE2L2, NOS3,
  NR1H4, Nr1h, PPARA, PPARGC1A, RARB, STK11, SUV39H1, TRIM28, WRN, XPA, XPC, XRCC6,
  and ZBTB14 and inhibits CRTC2, DUSP6, E2F1, FOXO3, HIF1A, NFκB, PPARG, SREBF1, STAT3,
  TP53, Trp73, and UCP2. Solid and dashed lines indicate direct and indirect relationship,
  respectively. The predicted relationships are denoted by different colors, wherein
  orange means “leads to activation”; blue indicates “leads to inhibition”; yellow
  implies that findings are inconsistent with the state of downstream molecules, and
  grey depicts that the effect is not predicted'
