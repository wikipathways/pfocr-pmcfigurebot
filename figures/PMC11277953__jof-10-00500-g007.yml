figure_title: Putative regulatory mechanism of SPI on biosynthesis of MPs and MK.
caption: 'Putative regulatory mechanism of SPI on biosynthesis of MPs and MK. EMP—Embden–Meyerhof
  pathway; PP—pentose phosphate pathway; PEP—pyruvate metabolism; FAD—fatty acid degradation;
  AAM—amino acid metabolism; TCA—tricarboxylic acid cycle. Different colors in the
  figure represent different metabolic pathways, and italics represent genes. Amino
  acids are represented by abbreviations. Asp: Aspartate, Phe: Phenylalanine, Ile:
  Isoleucine, Met: Methionine, Val: Valine, Glu: Glutamate, His: Histidine, Leu: leucine,
  Trp: Tryptophan'
