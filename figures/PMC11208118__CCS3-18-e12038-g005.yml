caption: Enoyl coenzyme A hydratase 1 (ECH1) is down‐regulated in human calcified
  aortic valves|calcific aortic valves. Single‐cell sequencing analysis of 6 aortic
  valve specimens (2 healthy and 4 calcified aortic valve lesions [calcific aortic
  valve disease] aortic valves), with a total of approximately 35,000 cells detected.
  (A) Cell subpopulation analysis. (B) Distribution of Ech1 in different cell subpopulations.
  (C) Expression and distribution of Ech1 (marked red) in normal and calcified valve
  cells. (D–E) The protein levels of ECH1 in aortic valve leaflets, unpaired two‐tailed
  Student's t‐test, n = 6 per group.

  by suppressing Runx2 via Wnt5a/Ca2+ pathway.
