caption: 'Metabolic pathway differences analysis among the different groups. (A) Metabolic
  pathway differences analysis. The differences in metabolic pathways enrichment between
  the recurring MCAO group and the sham control group were as follows: mice after
  single MCAO for 1 day, mice after single MCAO for 3 days and mice after single MCAO
  for 7 days. (B) Venn diagrams showing the commonly altered metabolic pathway numbers
  when ischemic stroke occurred (upper) and the detailed pathway list (lower)'
