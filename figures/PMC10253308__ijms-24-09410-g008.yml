figure_title: 2-PE synthesis pathway in herbaceous peony.
caption: 2-PE synthesis pathway in herbaceous peony. The numbers 1âˆ’17 represent 17
  cultivars, and numbers are assigned, as described in Figure 2. (A) Expression pattern
  of genes involved in the three possible 2-PE synthesis pathways of herbaceous peony.
  Gene expression levels in different cultivars are represented by color gradations.
  (B) The relative contents of 2-PE in 11 cultivars. The detailed data are sourced
  from Figure 4 and Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S4. (C) Correlation heat map
  between 2-PE release and gene expression levels. Correlation levels are represented
  by color gradations. Three biological replicates of the experiments were carried
  out
