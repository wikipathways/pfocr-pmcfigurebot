caption: Significant variation in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) contributes to
  substrate-induced divergent osteoclast differentiation. (A) The GSEA-KEGG analysis
  indicates that OXPHOS is a significantly enriched pathway across substrate comparisons.
  (B) GSEA-KEGG analysis indicates the presence of regulatory trends in the OXPHSO
  signaling pathway between the glass vs. bone, glass vs. dentin, and bone vs. dentin
  comparisons. (C) GSEA-GO analysis indicates regulatory trends in proton-transporting
  V-type ATPase among the glass vs. bone, glass vs. dentin, and bone vs. dentin groups.
  (D) Heatmap and density plots present OXPHOS gene expression profiles in mature
  osteoclasts cultured on three different substrates and in RAW 264.7 macrophages
  on Day 4. (E) Representative confocal immunofluorescence images show the expression
  levels of ATP6V0D1 and COXIV in osteoclasts cultured on glass, bone, and dentin
  substrates. Scale bar = 80 μm. (F,H) Quantitative transcriptomic analyses of Atp6v0d1
  and Coxiv gene expression in osteoclasts cultured on these substrates. (G,I) Quantitative
  analyses of the fluorescence intensity of ATP6V0D1 and COXIV proteins in osteoclasts
  cultured on these substrates, presented as mean ± SD (** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001)
