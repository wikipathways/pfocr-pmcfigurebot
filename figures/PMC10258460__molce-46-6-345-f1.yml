figure_title: Tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex status of various cells, hormones,
  and metabolites surrounding cancer cells. Understanding the phenomenon of TME seems
  to be a very effective strategy for conquering cancer cells. Pancreatic cancer is
  a highly lethal malignancy with no current therapeutic options. Lee et al. report
  a novel metabolic pathway for survival of pancreatic cancer using a metabolite trancing
  experiment. This distinct pathway provides a new paradigm in the field of cancer
  therapy using tumor energy metabolism. OAT, ornithine aminotransferase; ODC, ornithine
  decarboxylase; SRM, spermidine synthase; SMS, spermine synthase; KLF6, Krüppel-like
  factor 6
