caption: Current model of multi-target protective effects of β-caryophillene (BCP)
  at the intersection of mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.
  Upon stressful conditions, including oxidative injury, accumulation of altered/misfolded
  proteins, and inflammatory stimuli, mitochondria are impaired with the ensuing release
  of mtDAMPs such as ROS, Ca2+, oxidized mtDNA, cardiolipin, ATP, and TFAM. In surrounding
  neurons and glial cells, mtDAMPs bind to TLR9, the purinergic P2X7 receptor, RAGE,
  and TLR, promoting further mitochondrial damage and triggering pro-inflammatory,
  pro-apoptotic cascades that contribute to exacerbation of proinflammatory microglial
  activation, with the consequent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. BCP provides
  neuroprotective effects, decreasing oxidative stress by upregulating antioxidant
  defence, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the
  NFκB pathway, and preserving mitochondrial function upregulating respiratory enzyme
  complex (I–IV) activities. Therefore, Keap1 degradation and Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 signalling
  pathway activation, upregulation of the CB2R/PPARγ axis, and inhibition of the “JAK2-STAT3-BACE1”
  signalling pathway suppress TLR4, NO, PGE2, iNOS, and COX-2 expression, the secretion
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as Aβ oligomerization and deposition.
