  homolog gene)/Akt pathway.
caption: PI3K (phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases)/PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog
  gene)/Akt pathway. The binding of growth factors (GFs) to the receptor tyrosine
  kinase activates the receptor complex, which, in turn, recruits and activates PI3K.
  The activated PI3K converts PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate) to PIP3
  (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate), which subsequently mediates the phosphorylation
  of Akt through PDK1 (protein kinase 1). Phosphorylated Akt is active on a wide range
  of substrates, but one of its most important targets is mTOR, which is involved
  in cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Activated Akt (protein kinase B) also
  interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in an androgen-independent manner, leading
  to overactivation of the AR signaling pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.
  PTEN is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the pathway by removing the
  3-phosphate from PIP3, converting it back to PIP2. Loss of PTEN leads to overactivation
  of Akt, which, in turn, is associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation, decreased
  apoptosis, and enhanced tumor angiogenesis [22]
