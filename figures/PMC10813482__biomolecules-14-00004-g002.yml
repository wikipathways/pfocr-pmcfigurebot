caption: Histone acetylation modification of MSCs in the progression of SONFH. The
  transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins alpha (C/EBPα) is recruited
  to the promoter of PPARΓ, promoting H3K27Ac modification and upregulating PPARγ
  expression. Moreover, the low expression of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) inhibits
  histone acetylation modification and inactivates the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway,
  promoting the occurrence of SONFH
