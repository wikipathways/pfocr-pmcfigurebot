caption: Identification and function enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) of the lung during A/PR/8/34 infection. (a, d) Gene expression profile
  analyses of the infected lung with A/PR/8/34 strains indicating the common and distinct
  gene sets in 3 dpi and 5 dpi via Venn diagram; (b, e) gene ontology analysis showed
  the biological process of DEGs; (c, f) cell signalling pathway analyses showing
  pathway enrichment of the DEGs. Significant top 20 enriched by differentially expressed
  genes were shown
