figure_title: Effects of different treatments on cellular metabolites in DSS-induced
  Caco-2 cells.
caption: Effects of different treatments on cellular metabolites in DSS-induced Caco-2
  cells. (A) Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) based on the metabolites
  of Caco-2 cells among Blank, DSS, 100 μg/kg Honey + DSS, and 10 μM Trifolin + DSS
  groups (n = 4 for each group). (B) Volcano plot based on the differential metabolites
  of Caco-2 cells among DSS vs. Blank, 100 μg/kg Honey + DSS vs. DSS, and 10 μM Trifolin
  + DSS vs. DSS. (C) Log2 value of differential metabolites based on p value < 0.05,
  VIP ≥ 1 from PLS-DA, and FoldChange ≥ 2 or ≤0.5 from the volcano plot among each
  group. (D) Top-20 metabolic pathway mappings with KEGG databases based on FoldChange
  ≥ 2 or ≤0.5 for the difference in metabolites among each group
