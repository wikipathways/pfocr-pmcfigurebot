  The high expression level of CRNDE contributes to CRC by upregulating the
  signaling pathways such as Ras/MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin. In addition,
  CRNDE is able to competitively bind to its miRNA targets: miR-217, miR-181a-5p,
  miR-136, and miR-126-5p to inhibit their regulatory activities. Meanwhile, CRNDE
  can bind to EZH2 to suppress the expression of DUSP5 and CDKN1A. Lastly, the
  accumulated cytoplasmic hnRNPUL2 can increase the stability of CRNDE. Created
