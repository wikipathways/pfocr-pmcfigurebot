  mice.
caption: Effect of AB administration on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
  AP-1 signaling pathway in the dorsal skin of UVB-irradiated Skh:HR-1 hairless mice.
  The mice were administered AB through oral gavage for 12 weeks. All mice, except
  those in the NOR group, were exposed to UVB radiation three times per week for 12
  weeks. (A,C,E,G) Total lysates of the dorsal skin tissue were prepared and analyzed
  using Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Images of Western blots representative
  of three independent experiments are shown. (B,D,F,H) Quantitative analysis of Western
  blot results. The protein expression was normalized to that of β-actin and is represented
  relative to that in the NOR group. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM (n = 10).
  * p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, indicate significantly different values from that in the
  NOR group. Different letters indicate significant differences among the UV, UV+AB20,
  and UV+AB200 groups (p < 0.05)
