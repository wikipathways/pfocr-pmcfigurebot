figure_title: Proteomic changes in the hypothalamus of CIH mice.
caption: 'Proteomic changes in the hypothalamus of CIH mice. Mice in the CIH group
  were exposed to CIH for 3 weeks. At the end of the third week, control and CIH mice
  were sacrificed and the hypothalamus was preserved. Each group of three hypothalami
  is used for proteomics and acetylomics. (A) PCC analysis was used to compare the
  intensity values of all samples. (B) The total number of peptides and proteins that
  were identified after data filtering. (C) A volcano plot and (D) hierarchical clustering
  heatmap present DEPs, which were screened according to foldchange >1.5 or <0.667,
  with p value < 0.5. (E) COG, (F) GO-CC, (G) GO-MF, and (H) KEGG analyses were performed
  on DEPs. (I) The heatmap shows the protein expression in endocrine-related pathways.
  CIH: chronic intermittent hypoxia; PCC: Pearson correlation coefficient. DEPs: differentially
  expressed proteins; COGs: Clusters of Orthologous Groups; GO: Gene Ontology; CC:
  Cellular Component; MF: Molecular Function; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and
  Genomes'
