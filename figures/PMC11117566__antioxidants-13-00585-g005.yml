caption: A schematic illustration of W1302 alleviating learning impairments induced
  by hypoperfusion with hypertension through the NO-regulated NF-κB signaling pathway
  and mitochondrial function preservation. In this schematic diagram, SHR-2VO rats,
  a VaD model associated with spontaneous hypertension, significantly increase pIκB,
  pNF-κB, iNOS and TNF-α levels, which further damage mitochondrial function and increases
  oxidative stress. W1302 activated NO/cGMP and further inhibited the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, decreasing inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and iNOS levels, and protecting
  cells from mitochondria damage
