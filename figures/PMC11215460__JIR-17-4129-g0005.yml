caption: PKP2 knockdown regulates CLS during acute inflammation. (A) Successful verification
  of the PKP2 protein and mRNA knockdown (data represent three independent experiments).
  (B–D) The results of Lps-stimulated PKP2 knockdown in HUVECs demonstrated that down-regulation
  of PKP2 can significantly decrease the mRNA expression levels of CLS-related molecules,
  including AQP3, AQP5, occludin, connexin43, β-catenin, while simultaneously increasing
  the mRNA expression level of the oxidative stress-related gene ptgs2 (data represent
  the results of three independent experiments). (E) PKP2 knockdown resulted in increased
  permeability of HUVECs during acute inflammation (data represent the results of
  three independent experiments). (F) LPS-induced cytoskeleton disorder in HUVECs
  was aggravated after PKP2 knockdown (data represent the results of three independent
  experiments). (G) Decreased protein levels of ZO-1, β-catenin, and claudin1 were
  observed in HUVECs with acute inflammation after PKP2 knockdown (data represent
  the results of three independent experiments). (H) Immunofluorescence analysis revealed
  that occludin expression was downregulated in HUVECs with acute inflammation following
  PKP2 knockdown (data represent the results of three independent experiments). *p
