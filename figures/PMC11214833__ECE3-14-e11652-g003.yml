caption: Gene networks governing the response of Leucetta chagosensis to thermo‐acidic
  stress. (a) Co‐expression network of highly expressed genes in L. chagosensis. Each
  node represents a single gene. Edge distance indicates co‐expression strength between
  genes. (b) Correlation of gene modules (L1–L5) with the five treatments. Values
  are indicated for significant positive correlations. Bar graph (right) shows the
  number of genes per module, with hub genes represented by the darker shades. Acid,
  acidification; PD, present day; Warm, warming. (c) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  for module L3 and L5 hub genes.
article_title: Gene networks governing the response of a calcareous sponge to future
  ocean conditions reveal lineage‐specific XBP1 regulation of the unfolded protein
  response.
