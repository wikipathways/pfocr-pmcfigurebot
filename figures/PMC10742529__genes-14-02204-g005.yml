caption: The functional enrichment analysis of DEPs in B73 and the mutant. (A) The
  significant GO terms of biological processes involved in the DEPs in B73. (B) The
  significant GO terms of biological processes involved in the DEPs in the mutant.
  (C) The metabolic pathway of lignin biosynthesis. The heatmap shows the 5 DEPs catalyzed
  in the final step. L represents the low-Cd condition, H represents the high-Cd condition,
  Mutant represents the genotype ZmHMA3, and DEPs represents the differentially enriched
  proteins
