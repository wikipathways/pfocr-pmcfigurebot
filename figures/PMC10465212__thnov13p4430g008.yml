caption: Co-culture in 3D spheroids of senescent HSCs with rat primary hepatocytes.
  (A) Representative micrographs of immunofluorescent staining of HNF4α (hepatocyte
  markers, red) with β-catenin, E-cadherin and AFP (green) or α-SMA (HSC marker, green)
  with Gli-1 (Hedgehog pathway marker, red), p16 and p21 (senescent cells marker,
  red) in 3D spheroids after 2 weeks. Images were taken at original magnification
  (630×). Scale bars = 50 μm
