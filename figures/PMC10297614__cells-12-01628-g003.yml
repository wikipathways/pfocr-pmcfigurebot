caption: The associations of the PCP pathway-related gene signature in high DDX3X
  group with poor overall survival were analyzed. The correlation of indicated RNA
  levels with overall survival in liver cancer cohorts were studied and shown. Data
  were retrieved and analyzed from the HPA database (https://www.proteinatlas.org/
