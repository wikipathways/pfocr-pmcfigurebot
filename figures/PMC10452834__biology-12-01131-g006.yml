caption: Proposed role of glutaminase I (GLS1) and GTωA pathways in the metabolism
  of branched-chain amino acids in cancer. The branched-chain amino acids in the cytosol
  stimulate the mTORC1 and, thus, increase cellular protein synthesis. The BCAAs are
  also transaminated into the corresponding α-keto acids in the cytosol and mitochondria
  by the action of BCAT1 and BCAT2, respectively. This process involves the conversion
  of α-ketoglutarate to l-glutamate (red arrows). The α-keto acids thus generated
  are converted to acyl-CoAs, which can be further metabolized to succinyl-CoA and
  enter the TCA cycle to generate useful energy. Thus, there is a net consumption
  of α-ketoglutarate by the action of the two BCATs. α-Ketoglutarate can potentially
  be replenished by the action of both GLS1 (followed by the GDH reaction (shown)
  or an l-glutamate-linked aminotransferase (not shown)) and the GTωA pathways (blue
  arrows). A consequence of this pathway interaction is that GLS1 inhibitors that
  are currently in human clinical trials such as CB-839 may lack full efficacy because
  the GTωA pathway can substitute for the GLS1 pathway to generate α-ketoglutarate,
  which will continue to be transaminated by the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferases.
