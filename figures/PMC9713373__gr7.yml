caption: Transcriptional perturbation of cancer pathways upon PNCK knockdownCy3-control
  and PNCK knockdown RCC cell lines were generated as in . At 48 h post-transfection,
  RNA was extracted from cells and was used to assay 84-cancer pathway-related genes
  in a qPCR array (See , RT2 Caner Profiler Array Data).(A–D) HeatMap of differentially
  expressed Angiogenesis (A), Apoptosis (B), Cell cycle (C), and DNA damage (D) pathway
  genes in 4 RCC cell lines. Colors represent Log2fold change compared to control
  with white representing 0. Exact values for each gene are found in .(E–H) Bar plot
  representation of differentially expressed Angiogenesis (A), Apoptosis (B), Cell
  cycle (C), and DNA damage (D) pathway genes in 4 RCC cell lines.
