caption: (A) A schematic diagram of the metabolic pathway of the cell wall and membrane
  components. (B) The effect of D-limonene on the gene transcription of cell wall
  and membrane metabolism. (C) The SEM images of P. kluyveri Y-11519, magnification
  30,000×. (D) The differentially expressed genes in the cell wall and membranes were
  verified via RT-qPCR analysis. (E) The cell membrane potential of P. kluyveri Y-11519
  treated with D-limonene for 3 h
