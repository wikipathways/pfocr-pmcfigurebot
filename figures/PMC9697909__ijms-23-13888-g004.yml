caption: The various functions of Rho1p in the life cycle of fission yeast. (A) Rgf1p-dependent
  Rho1p activity participates in the activation of bipolar actin and bipolar growth
  during NETO. (B) Rgf1p induction of Rho1p activity is required to maintain cell
  homeostasis in response to cell wall damage and osmotic shock signalling through
  CIP. (C) Rgf1p and Rho1p participate in a checkpoint pathway that controls actomyosin
  ring constriction in response to cell wall damage. (D) Rgf1p and Rho1p activity
  positively controls the repair function that confers resistance against the anti-cancer
  drug Phleomycin, which induces double-strand breaks in the DNA. (E) Rgf3p induction
  of Rho1p activity during cytokinesis promotes cell wall remodelling, which is essential
  to achieve cell separation. (F) Rgf2p-specific Rho1p activity plays an essential
  function in the synthesis of the β–glucan layer necessary to achieve spore maturation.
