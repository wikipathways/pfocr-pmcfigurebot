caption: 'The effect of DMF on renal function, inflammatory indexes, and oxidative
  stress in the kidney injury following traumatic brain injury model. (A) serum creatinine
  levels. (B) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels. (C) IL-1β content.
  (D) IL-6 content. (E) TNF-α content. (F) MDA content. (G) SOD activity. The results
  were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. *: p < 0.05 in comparison to
  control. #: p < 0.05 in comparison to the model group.'
