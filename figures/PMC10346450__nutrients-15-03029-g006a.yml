figure_title: Effects of EHG on LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine production,
  as well as the NF-ĸB pathway, in RAW264.
caption: 'Effects of EHG on LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine production,
  as well as the NF-ĸB pathway, in RAW264.7 cells. (A) Cell viability measurements.
  (B) NO production determined using the Griess reaction in supernatants from RAW264.7
  cells. Levels of (C) TNF-α, (D) IL-6, (E) IL-1β, and (F) IL-10 in RAW264.7 macrophages.
  (G) Protein expression of iNOS, COX-2, and components of the NF-ĸB signaling pathway
  were assessed using immunoblotting. Equal amounts of total protein were analyzed
  via SDS-PAGE and the quantitative analysis of the indicated blots is shown. The
  densitometry data are expressed as the relative density of protein bands, which
  were normalized to the level of β-actin (H). All values represent the mean ± SD
  from three independent experiments. The data obtained were subjected to analysis
  using Duncan’s multiple comparison test. *** p < 0.001 vs. N (normal group); # p
  < 0.05, ### p < 0.001 vs. LPS'
