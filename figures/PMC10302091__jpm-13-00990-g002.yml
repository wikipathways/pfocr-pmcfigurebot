figure_title: Go terms and enrichment of DEIRGs.
caption: 'Go terms and enrichment of DEIRGs. (A), Advanced bubble chart shows GO enrichment
  significance items of DEIRGs in three func-tional groups: molecular function (MF),
  biological processes (BP), and cell composition (CC). (B), Chord plot shows the
  distribution of DEIRGs in different GO-enriched functions. The GO indicated that
  DEIRGs were mainly enriched in response to lipopolysaccharide, in response to molecules
  of bacterial origin, secretory granule membrane, and external side of plasma, receptor
  ligand activity, and signaling receptor activator activity. Gene ratio and pathways
  are represented by the x-axis and y-axis, respectively; the size and color of the
  dots indicate the gene count and the level of p value, respectively'
