  metabolism.
caption: 'Metabolic pathway analysis depicting the impact of diabetes on systemic
  metabolism. MetaboAnalyst with the KEGG database was used to analyse z-scores from
  metabolites with VIP > 1 in OPLS regression for combined MS and NMR spectroscopy
  data. (A) Pathway impact determined using MetaboAnalyst and respective significance
  (p-values). (B) Significant findings after false discovery rate adjustment (adjusted
  p < 0.05; bars) and respective number of hits (metabolites analysed in that pathway;
  symbols). Pathways with impact score = 0 are not represented in (A) but are listed
  in (B). Dashed line in panel A indicates p = 0.05, and labels are as follows: 1—pyrimidine
  metabolism; 2—histidine metabolism; 3—alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism;
  4—cysteine and methionine metabolism; 5—glutamine and glutamate metabolism; 6—glutathione
  metabolism; 7—arginine and proline metabolism; 8—arginine biosynthesis'
