caption: Ginsentide TP1 prevents hypoxic stress-mediated cell death. (A) Viability
  of hypoxic cells measured using an MTT assay after treatment with TP1 or vehicle
  control. Relative survival is expressed as mean values and statistical significance
  was calculated using three independent experimental replicates. (B) Effects of ginsentides,
  i.e., TP1, TP3, and TP8, and ginsenosides, i.e., Rb1 and Rg1, on the viability of
  hypoxic HUVEC-CS cells. Viability was measured using an MTT assay after treatment
  with 20 µM ginsenoside (Rb1 or Rg1), 20 µM ginsentide (TP1, TP3, or TP8), or PBS
  (vehicle control). Relative survival is expressed as mean values ± standard error
  of the mean (SEM) from three independent experimental replicates. * p < 0.05. (C)
  Relative change in the expression of apoptotic signaling pathway proteins after
  24 h of hypoxic culture in the presence of TP1. Statistical significance was calculated
  using data from triplicate experiments. (D) Effect of TP1 on hypoxia-induced apoptosis
  in HUVEC-CS cells. Relative quantification was based on annexin V and propidium
  Iodide (PI) staining used to identify apoptotic cells. Statistical significance
  was calculated using three independent experimental replicates. Data are means ±
  SEM for triplicate experiments. * p < 0.05
