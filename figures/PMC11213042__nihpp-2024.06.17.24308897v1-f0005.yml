figure_title: Prioritized candidate genes at novel loci
caption: A, Supporting evidence by candidate per GWAS locus. B, Scheme of ligand-receptor
  and proximal components of IL-6 and IL-22 signaling pathway. Corresponding expression
  and protein QTL associations mapped to the lead AD GWAS variant risk allele are
  shown. The figure was created using BioRender. C, Genotype-phenotype association
  p-values of the IL6ST, IL22RA2, ITK and BATF locus. First panel illustrates ITK
  ENST00000522616 sQTL signal in T helper 2 cells (Th2), second panel illustrates
  BATF eQTL signal in CD8+ memory T-cells, third panel illustrates IL6ST eQTL signal
  in T follicular helper cells (Tfh), forth panel illustrates IL22RA2 pQTL signal
  in plasma. For all panels, bottom part illustrates GWAS signal for AD. Lead GWAS
  variant mapped to AD risk allele is typed and indicated by a triangle-shaped point,
  pointing upwards or downwards for positive or negative effect size, respectively.
  Linkage disequilibrium between loci is quantified by squared Pearson coefficient
  of correlation (r2). P-values correspond to nominal GWAS and QTL associations, derived
  from multiple regression two-sided t-tests
