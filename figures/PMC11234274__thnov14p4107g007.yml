caption: Intercellular communications show that SPP1 secreted by CEBPB+ GBM subcluster
  may regulate M2 TAMs. (A) A summary of cell communication between M2 TAMs and 13
  glioma clusters. The Number of interactions indicates the quantity of distinct signaling
  pathways between each pair of clusters. The Interactions Weights/strength reflects
  the intensity or significance of these interactions, which might be calculated based
  on the expression levels of signaling molecules or other metrics. (B) Bubble plot
  shows the potential ligand-receptor interactions between CEBPB+ GBM subcluster and
  M2 TAMs. The dot color and size represent the calculated communication probability
  and p values. P values are computed from one-sided permutation test. (C) The inferred
  SPP1 signaling pathway network and SPP1 - (ITGAV+ITGB1) interaction network. Circle
  sizes are proportional to the number of cells in each cell cluster and edge width
  represents the communication probability. (D) The expression distribution of SPP1
  on t-SNE coordinates and (E) their expression in various glioma clusters. (F) Kaplan-Meier
  curves of patient survival stratified by the median of SPP1 expression level from
  TCGA GBM and CGGA-GBM databases. P values were determined by log-rank. (G) SPP1
  expression in subtype (n = 162, PN; n = 198, CL; n = 165, MES) from the TCGA GBM
  database. Black bars indicate mean ± s.d. ***p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA with Tukey's
  method for multiple comparisons. (H) shows SPP1 expression in GBM patients with
  IDH1 status (n = 30, MUT; n = 372, WT; n = 123, NA) in the TCGA GBM database. Data
  are represented as means ± s.d. **p < 0.01; two-tailed unpaired t-test
