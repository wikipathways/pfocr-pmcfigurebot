caption: Interactions of the SPP1 signaling pathway with distinct ovarian cell types.
  (A) The circos plot illustrates the shared characteristics and correlations among
  various SPP1 cells within the ovary. (B) Visualization of cellular communication
  relationships at each level of the signaling pathway. (C) Cellâ€“cell communication
  illustrates interactions between cells, with line thickness indicating the strength
  of these connections. (D) A heatmap displays the quantity of variations or the strength
  of interactions
