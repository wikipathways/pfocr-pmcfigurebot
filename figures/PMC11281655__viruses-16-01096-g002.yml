caption: The role of RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway in antiviral immunity.
  BRD4 mediates IRF and NF-ÎºB-dependent innate response networks through RIG-I and
  TLR3 signaling pathways. BRD4 can also regulate viral infection by interacting with
  interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and viral proteins
