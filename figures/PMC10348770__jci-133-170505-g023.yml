figure_title: Mechanisms of Treg-mediated immunosuppression and resolution of lung
  inflammation
caption: Tregs exert pleiotropic effects on innate (A) and adaptive (B) immune cells
  to dampen excessive alveolar inflammation and promote resolution following infection-induced
  lung inflammation and injury. (A) Tregs express the high-affinity IL-2 receptor
  and interact with other immune cell subsets, suppressing their activation and modulating
  their function. During resolution of lung inflammation, Tregs generate IL-13, signaling
  alveolar macrophages to secrete IL-10. Autocrine IL-10 then promotes macrophage
  efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils through activation of the VAV1/RAC1 signaling
  pathway and subsequent cytoskeleton remodeling to prevent excessive tissue damage.
  Tregs also promote a pro-resolution phenotype in macrophages by inhibiting TNF-α
  generation and inducing TGF-β secretion. IL-22 induction, possibly through a CD4+
  Th cell intermediate, contributes to recovery and may be Treg dependent. (B) Tregs
  also dampen primary T cell responses to respiratory infections that include CD4+
  Th1 cells, Th2 cells (and subsequent recruitment of eosinophils), CD8+ T cells,
  and γδ T cells, inhibiting excessive inflammation in response to pathogens. In contrast,
  Tregs may have a role in the generation of CD8+ memory cells, but their effect on
  individual compartments of the memory pool is unknown. Tregs also express surface
  molecules, such as CTLA-4, PD-1, CD39, and CD73, that inhibit inflammation, but
  the role of these molecules in responses to lung pathogens is unclear
