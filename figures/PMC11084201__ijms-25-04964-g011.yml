figure_title: Level of key regulators in the GLUT4-AMPK signaling pathway.
caption: 'Level of key regulators in the GLUT4-AMPK signaling pathway. (A) Expression
  level of the GLUT4 protein. (B) Transcription level of the GLUT4 gene. (C) Phosphorylation
  level of AMPK. After the collection of the total proteins from the liver tissue,
  the expression levels of the GLUT4, p-AMPK, and AMPK proteins were determined by
  a Western blot. The preparation of the total homogenates from the liver tissue was
  performed for five to six mice per group, and the expression levels of each protein
  were analyzed twice for each sample. After the collection of the total RNA from
  the liver tissue, the mRNA level of the gene encoding GLUT4 was analyzed by RT-qPCR.
  The preparation of the total RNA from the liver tissue was performed on five to
  six mice per group, and the transcription levels of each gene were analyzed twice
  for each tissue. The data represent the means ± SD. * indicates p < 0.05 compared
  to the vehicle-treated group. # indicates p < 0.05 compared to the WT mice. Abbreviation:
  WT; wild type, Lep KO; leptin knockout, MPs; microplastics, RT-qPCR; reverse transcription-quantitative
  polymerase chain reaction, GLUT4; Glu transporter type 4, AMPK; 5′ AMP-activated
  protein kinase'
