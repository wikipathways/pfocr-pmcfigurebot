caption: 'KEGG pathway analysis of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. (A) Enzymes in
  red have increased expression in the opioid specimens compared to the naïve. Expression
  of the enzymes in blue is decreased. Values are log2-transformed fold-change values
  between the opioid specimens compared with the naïve specimens. (B) Boxplots representing
  the mRNA expression of selected members of glycolysis (ACSS1: acyl-CoA synthetase
  short chain family member 1; ALDH3B1: aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member B1;
  ENO1: enolase 1; G6PC2: glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 2; LDHB: lactate
  dehydrogenase B; PCK2: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2; PDHA1: pyruvate dehydrogenase
  E1 alpha 1 subunit; PFKFB1: 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase
  1; PGM2: phosphoglucomutase 2). * indicates that the gene is significantly regulated
  between the 2 groups (p < 0.05)'
