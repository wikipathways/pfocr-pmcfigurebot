caption: Enoyl coenzyme A hydratase 1 (ECH1) regulates transcriptional activity of
  RUNX2 via altered Wnt5a/Ca2+Signaling. (A) Luciferase (Luc) reporter constructs
  containing promoters of Runx2 were co‐transfected with an internal control plasmid
  pRL‐TK into MC3T3‐E1 cells, with or without treatment of osteogenic medium and CHIR99021
  (Wnt agonist). One‐way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. n = 4 per group.
  (B) Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed in MC3T3‐E1 cell line. IgG
  was used as a negative control. (C–H) Immunoblots for Runx2 and Osteocalcin in osteogenic
  medium treated human aortic valve interstitial cells (hVICs) overexpressing ECH1,
  followed by different treatments and statistical analysis. I–J, Alizarin red staining
  of mineralization nodules in hVICs with different treatment. Two‐way ANOVA followed
  by Bonferroni post hoc test. n = 6 per group. Two‐way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
  post hoc test. n = 6 per group. Values are the mean ± SD. ANOVA, analysis of variance.
