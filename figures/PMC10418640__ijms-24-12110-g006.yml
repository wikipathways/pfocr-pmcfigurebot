caption: EGF and FGF growth factor interaction networks to predict key proteins and
  possible molecular pathways involved in hair growth. Interactomes of EGF (a) and
  FGF (b). The images illustrate a red box pointing to EGF and FGF proteins. The yellow
  boxes highlight growth factors, or their receptors related to hair growth, while
  the blue boxes represent proteins associated with the cell proliferation signaling
  pathway, and those in magenta play a role in modulating angiogenesis
