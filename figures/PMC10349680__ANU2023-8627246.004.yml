figure_title: Effect of feeding different levels of DBWLM instead of fish meal on
  gut microflora function of P.
caption: Effect of feeding different levels of DBWLM instead of fish meal on gut microflora
  function of P. vannamei and correlation analysis of biochemical indexes. (a) Level-2
  function prediction of intestinal microbial abundance (KEGG metabolic pathway statistics).
  (b) Clustering heatmap with relatively rich KEGG level-3 functions. (c) Correlation
  analysis between intestinal flora and biochemical indexes. The illustration shows
  the correlation coefficient value. The default red represents a positive correlation
  and the blue represents a negative correlation. The star number between different
  patches indicates the importance of each exposure compared with the control. Statistical
  analysis using a t test,  ∗represents P < 0.05,  ∗∗represents P < 0.01
