caption: 'Random forest analysis (RFA). The assessment of blank, ground control, and
  SPC-flown NSCs was highly effective. The biochemical importance plot highlighted
  biochemicals related to a number of super family pathways: amino acids associated
  with glutaminolysis (Ala, Asn, Asp, Gln), amino acid metabolites from BCAA catabolism
  (1-carboxyethylisoleucine, 1-carboxyethylvaline, 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate,
  alpha-ketoglutaramate), metabolites from nitrogen metabolism (urea, creatine, N-acetyl-putrescine),
  lipids associated with metabolism of phospholipids (malonate, glycerol, choline,
  glycerophosphorylcholine), and nucleotide metabolism (hypoxanthine, 2â€²-deoxycytidine).
  Random forest classification using named metabolites in media of blank compared
  to 1 G and 0 G NSCs gave a predictive accuracy of 100%. Random chance would be expected
  to yield a predictive accuracy of 33%. We found two molecules with unclear identities:
  X25035, which is most likely a peptide, and X25865. RFA was performed as previously
  described [20]'
