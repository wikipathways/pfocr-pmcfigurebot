caption: Protein pathway analysis in large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGL). Genes
  from a single-cell TCR coupled with RNA sequencing of CD3+ T cells from LGL [65]
  were extracted, and those upregulated or downregulated (A) at diagnosis and (B)
  after alemtuzumab treatment were used for protein pathway analysis using the STRING
  database and by also adding HIF-1α. First 15 that better represented networks are
  reported for (C) diagnosis and (D) after treatment
