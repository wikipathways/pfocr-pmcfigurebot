caption: The functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs obtained from drought or high-temperature
  treatments. (A,C) The enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms for DEGs identified from
  Pyrus betulifolia seedlings before (D_0 h, H_0 h) and after being subjected to drought
  stress (for 48 h, D_48 h) or high-temperature stresses (for 9 h, H_9 h), respectively.
  (B,D) The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of
  DEGs isolated from Pyrus betulifolia seedlings before (D_0 h, H_0 h) and after being
  subjected to drought stress (for 48 h, D_48 h) or high-temperature stresses (for
  9 h, H_9 h), respectively. The number of genes in each pathway is equal to the size
  of the dot. The dot color represents the p-value
