figure_title: Bar plot of the hierarchical abundance of KEGG metabolic pathways (A).
caption: 'Bar plot of the hierarchical abundance of KEGG metabolic pathways (A). LEfSe
  analysis of the metabolic pathways of KEGG (B). Note: In (A), the abscissa is the
  sample name, and the ordinate (Sequence Number Percent) represents the ratio of
  the relative abundance of the metabolic pathway annotated to each sample at the
  functional level to the total annotation data. The top-down color order of the bar
  chart corresponds to the legend color order on the right, the legend shows the most
  advantageous 20 metabolic pathways, and the remaining metabolic pathways are classified
  as Other displayed in the figure. In (B), the abscissa is the sample name, and the
  ordinate (Sequence Number Percent) represents the ratio of the relative abundance
  of functional metabolic pathways to each sample at the functional level the top-down
  color order of the bar chart corresponds to the color order of the legend on the
  right, the legend shows the most dominant 20 metabolic pathways, the remaining metabolic
  pathways are classified as displayed in the figure'
