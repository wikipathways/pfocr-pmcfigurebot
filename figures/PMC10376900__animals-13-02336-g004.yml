caption: The mRNA expression level of the DEGs in the cytokine−cytokine receptor pathway
  in goose primary hepatocytes transfected with IGFBP2 overexpression vector versus
  empty vector (the control). The mRNA expression of the genes of interest was determined
  by qPCR. *, ** denote p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 versus the control, respectively. n
  = 6. The internal reference gene was β-actin and all data are presented as the mean
  ± SEM
