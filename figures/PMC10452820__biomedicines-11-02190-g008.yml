caption: BHLHE40 regulates the stemness of PαS cells through Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. (A) Relative expression of Ccnd1, Ctnnb1, and Wnt3a mRNA was evaluated
  by qRT-PCR in overexpressed Bhlhe40 (Bhlhe40) group and negative control (Vector)
  group in vitro. Gapdh was used for normalization. (B) Relative expression of Wnt3a,
  and Ccnd1 mRNA was evaluated by qRT-PCR in Bhlhe40 group and Vector group transfected
  with siZbp1 and siNC, respectively. Gapdh was used for normalization. (C,D) ARS
  staining and quantification of Bhlhe40 group and Bhlhe40 + IWR-1-endo group in vitro
  after 14 days of osteogenic differentiation. (E) Relative expression of BGLAP protein
  was evaluated by ELISA in Bhlhe40 group and Bhlhe40 + IWR-1-endo group in vitro
  after 14 days of osteogenic differentiation. (F) Alcian blue staining in well plates
  of Bhlhe40 group and Bhlhe40 + IWR-1-endo group after 21 days of chondrogenic differentiation.
  Scale bar = 100 μm and 500 μm, n = 3. (G) Relative expression of COMP protein was
  evaluated by ELISA in Bhlhe40 group and Bhlhe40 + IWR-1-endo in vitro after 21 days
  of chondrogenic differentiation. (H) Relative expression of Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2
  mRNA was evaluated by qRT-PCR in Bhlhe40 group and Bhlhe40+IWR-1-endo group in vitro.
  Gapdh was used for normalization. (I) Relative expression of NANOG and OCT4 protein
  was evaluated by ELISA in Bhlhe40 + IWR-1-endo group and Vector group in vitro.
