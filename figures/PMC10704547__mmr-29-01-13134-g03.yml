  activity in breast cancer cells.
caption: AhR ligand-activated pathways/genes exhibit anticancer or pro-cancer activity
  in breast cancer cells. In the AhR-canonical signaling pathway, AhR interacts with
  ARNT and binds to XRE to regulate gene expression, including that of some miRNAs
  and MMPs. In the AhR-non-canonical signaling pathway, AhR binds to certain other
  transcription factors, such as ERα and NF-κB, to regulate gene expression. AhR,
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor; AHRR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor; AIP, aryl
  hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein; ARNT, AhR nuclear translocator; COX-2,
  cyclooxygenase-2; CXCR4, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4; ERα, estrogen receptor
  α; Hsp90, heat shock protein 90; JAG1, jagged canonical Notch ligand 1; KLF4, Krüppel-like
  factor 4; miRNA/miR, microRNA; NC, non-consensus; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
  factor; XRE, xenobiotic response elements
